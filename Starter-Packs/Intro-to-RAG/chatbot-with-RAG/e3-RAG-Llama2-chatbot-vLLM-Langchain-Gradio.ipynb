    "# Implementing a chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Llama-2-13b-chat, vLLM, LangChain, and the Gradio UI\n",
    "- [**Langchain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework for the fast prototyping of applications powered by language models. In this example we replaced the Gradio's chatbot memory with LangChain's memory implemented by the `LLMChain` class.\n",
    "- [**vLLM**](https://www.gradio.app/) is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving. In this example, we use LangChain's `VLLMOpenAI` class to access the vLLM OpenAI API-compatible service.\n",
    "- [**Gradio**](https://www.gradio.app/) is a fast way to demo machine learning models with a friendly web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine the capabilities of large language models and information retrieval systems to improve the quality of generated responses. In a RAG system, the process generally involves two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: Given a query, the system retrieves a set of relevant documents or passages from a pre-existing knowledge base or corpus. This retrieval step is usually performed using traditional information retrieval techniques or learned embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to a generative model, like Llama 2. The model uses this additional context to generate more informed, relevant, and accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining retrieval and generation, RAG systems aim to provide answers that are not only contextually coherent but also factually accurate, even when the information is not explicitly present in the model's pre-training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this RAG example, we expand the LLama 2 knowledge with a knowledge base consisting of three NY Times articles (serialized as PDF documents) about the Otis category 5 hurricane which stormed the Pacific coast of Mexico by the end of October 2023. This knowledge base contains data that is posterior to the datasets used to pre-train LLama 2 and fine-tune Llama 2 Chat, which date prior July 2023.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Please follow the instructions provided by the README.md file from the \n",
    "[LLM-fine-tuning-example](https://github.com/vmware-ai-labs/VMware-generative-ai-reference-architecture/tree/main/Examples/LLM-fine-tuning-example) directory to create a conda virtual environment with all the libraries used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Llama2 from the Transformers library you need to get approval from Meta and HuggingFace. \n",
    "- Please follow these [instructions provided by HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) before continuing.\n",
    "- Then [create a Hugging Face user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) to be able to download LLama 2 models from HF Hub.\n",
    "- Once you have created an access token, please login from the shell terminal using any of these options:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # Using an interactive command\n",
    "    huggingface-cli login\n",
    "  \n",
    "    # or using an environment variable\n",
    "    huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- You can serve Llama-2-13B-chat on an A100 (40GB) GPU using vLLM by running the following command:\n",
    "`python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model=\"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you should be all set to get started!\n",
