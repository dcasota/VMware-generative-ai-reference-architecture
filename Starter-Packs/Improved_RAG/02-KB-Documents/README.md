# Downloading NASA History Books
The corpus used to develop and test the Improved RAG Starter Pack consists of 
__[10 NASA history books](https://www.nasa.gov/ebooks/) that add up around 3855 pages.__ 

NASA's Space exploration track record define a very interesting topic for many audiences and represent a 
change from the typical RAG demos relying on single-document ingestion.

To download the e-books, please run the `get_NASA_books.sh` script included in this directory. It will pull the
documents into the `./NASA` directory.

__Make sure you download these documents before proceeding to the execution of the scripts inside the
`03-Document_ingestion` directory.__
