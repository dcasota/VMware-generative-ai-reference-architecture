This modification enabled aircraft to reach higher speeds, as demonstrated by a single-engine fighter that was theoretically capable of 400 mph with the right propeller but could not yet reach that speed with a conventional propeller root-shape.\\n\\nThe North American P-51 Mustang fighter was modified with blade cuffs for increased performance, which maximized the aircraft's overall performance. Similarly, cuffed propellers improved the cooling of radial engine designs such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the four-engine Boeing B-29 Superfortress long-range bomber, which were known for their notorious cooling and engine fire problems.\\n\\nTherefore, propeller cuffs played a crucial role in enhancing the performance of fighter aircraft and improving the cooling of radial engine designs, contributing to their overall efficiency and safety.   \n",

       "49   \\nThe Space Studies Board (SSB) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAC) are two different entities that provide recommendations to NASA, but they differ in their relationship with NASA and the public availability of their reports.\\n\\nThe NAC is an organization that is internal to NASA, meaning it is part of the agency. The NASA Administrator has the authority to implement NAC recommendations, or not. The NAC does not publish many formal studies, and the recommendations may or may not be made public.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the SSB is external to NASA and conducts studies for the agency on a contractual basis. Nearly all SSB reports are available to the public, and the board regularly briefs Congress on findings. This means that the SSB's recommendations are more likely to be made public and accessible to the general public.\\n\\nIn terms of the planetary decadal survey process, the SSB has been conducting decadal surveys for planetary science since the early 2000s, providing recommendations from the science community on programs within NASA and prioritizing the most important questions in planetary science. The SSB's decadal surveys have shifted the focus of programmatic decision-making for NASA, as they include more detailed programmatic recommendations than most previous SSB works.\\n\\nCongress has often instructed NASA to fund studies on various topics and now regularly includes language in legislation directing NASA to execute the recommendations of SSB decadal surveys. Excerpts from decadal surveys have appeared in congressional authorization legislation, indicating the high regard in which members of Congress now hold these reports.\\n\\nTherefore, the SSB's planetary decadal survey process is more transparent and publicly available than the NAC's process, and it has a more significant impact on NASA's programmatic decision-making.   \n",

This was done by maintaining the YO-3A microphone location at a fixed distance and position with respect to the XV-15 proprotor, and by operating at the same prop-rotor operating condition. This allowed for a direct comparison between the flight data and wind tunnel test data.   \n",

The spacecraft, named \"Object-Probes\" (ob'yekt-zond), was designed to depart from Earth's ecliptic out to 12-16 million kilometers from Earth and then return back to Earth after about six months when its orbit intersected with that of Earth again. The spacecraft was aided by two mid-course corrections using its S5.45 main engine.\\n\\nHowever, the outcome of the mission was not successful. During the mission, the third and fourth stages separated abnormally, and after reaching Earth orbit, ground control lost telemetry from the Blok L upper stage designed to send the vehicle past the Moon. As a result, the spacecraft remained stranded in Earth orbit. The stage's main engine turbopump probably exploded upon ignition, destroying the spacecraft. With this mission, the Soviets began the practice of giving \"Kosmos\" designations to obscure the failure of lunar and planetary probes that remained stranded in Earth orbit. If the spacecraft had successfully departed from Earth orbit, it would probably have been called \"Zond 1.\"   \n",

Some of the jets are collimated and produce water vapor (H2O), while others on the night side are rich in carbon dioxide (CO2). The ratio of cometary production rates of CO2 compared to H2O is about 7 percent, suggesting a heterogeneous nucleus.\\n\\nSpectral observations by the University of Maryland's Jessica Sunshine and colleagues detected water ice in the impact ejecta and in three small patches on the surface of the nucleus. However, these surface patches are too small to explain the total amount of atmospheric water vapor, so most of it must come from subsurface sources. The top few centimeters of the comet's surface are largely ice-free, and the bulk of the H2O and CO2 ices are likely within 1 meter of the surface.\\n\\nTo account for the observed surface layering and the diverse composition of these layers, Arizona researcher Michael Belton suggested a nucleus model consisting of a pile of randomly stacked layers. These diverse layers are thought to have been produced over time by impacts of comets that originated in differing regions of a non-uniform protoplanetary nebula. This model, nicknamed the TALPS model, postulates the formation of layered cometary nuclei by the successive collisions of diverse, smaller, primordial comets.\\n\\nThe evidence supporting these inferences includes the Deep Impact mission observations, spectral observations by the University of Maryland, and the TALPS model, which was developed based on these observations.   \n",

This allowed engineers to model the behavior of blunt-body objects and break down the equations into usable subparts, establishing methodologies for resolving multiple variables concurrently. This led to the successful redesign of the wing for the HiMAT vehicle, a 1/3 scale model of a fighter plane used to test new aerodynamic and control concepts.\\n\\nSimilarly, CFD techniques were also key to the successful retrofitting of the engines on the Boeing 737. By using data from CFD studies, Boeing engineers were able to design the new fanjets for the engines for much greater efficiency. This helped make the Boeing 737 one of the most successful passenger airliners in history.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while CFD provides great capabilities to resolve Navier-Stokes equations, wind tunnels are necessary to validate CFD findings and demonstrate solutions in the real world. Wind tunnels, often exceedingly small ones that used tiny models, were ideal for that purpose.   \n",

In the context of single-stage-to-orbit vehicles (SSTO), this design approach has been a significant challenge due to the high reliability required for the vehicle to reach orbit. The failure of any single system could result in the mission being lost, making the development of SSTO vehicles with this design approach a complex and risky endeavor.

Blade \\ndesign reflected a compromise where most of the blade was an airfoil, but the \\nportion where it attached to the hub, called the root, was round for structural \\nstrength. In 1939, Langley researchers in the Full-Scale Tunnel investigated a \\nsingle-engine fighter that was theoretically capable of 400 mph with the right \\npropeller but could not yet reach that speed with a conventional propeller \\nroot-shape. To each blade root, they attached airfoil-shaped cuffs that covered \\nover 45 percent of the blade. The increased blade area enabled the fighter to \\nreach 400 mph at 20,000 feet. Langley carried on with extensive research on \\ncuffs that allowed for the modification of existing blade designs.49 The North \\nAmerican P-51 Mustang fighter was modified with blade cuffs for increased \\nperformance, and cuffed propellers likewise improved the cooling of radial \\nengine designs such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and—very significantly, \\nbecause of its notorious cooling and engine fire problems—the four-engine \\nBoeing B-29 Superfortress long-range bomber.\\nFigure 1-2.

Incidentally, each toilet on this ship is equipped with standard size \\ntoilet seat and is of the flushing type. The flushing water is the waste water from the \\nhand and dental lavatories. As the toilet top is raised, a cylinder is filled with this \\nwater and when the lid is lowered this cylinder discharges the water, flushing the \\ntoilet bowl[,] and then the contents are dumped outside the aircraft.\\nThe men’s dressing room is fitted with two hand lavatories with hot and cold \\nrunning water, one dental lavatory and, believe it or not, a stand up urinal. This \\nurinal will no doubt be an interesting innovation to the passengers.

By \\nthe early 2000s, witnessing the success of the SSB’s decadal survey process \\nfor astronomy and astrophysics, NASA requested that the SSB undertake a \\ndecadal survey for planetary science. The survey provided recommendations \\nfrom the science community on programs within NASA and prioritized the \\nmost important questions in planetary science. Prioritization allowed NASA \\nflexibility in the event of budget cuts, cost overruns, or unexpected circum-\\nstances, and directed the Agency toward a strategy that the planetary sci-\\nence community supported. The survey also explained NASA’s rationale for \\nits programmatic choices to Congress and demonstrated that those choices \\nwere supported by the science community. The planetary survey represented \\na shift in programmatic decision-making for NASA, as it included more \\ndetailed programmatic recommendations than most previous SSB works.\\nThat trend continues with the most recent decadal survey, Vision and \\nVoyages for Planetary Science in the Decades 2013–2022,72 which outlines sci-\\nentific and general programmatic recommendations and includes guidelines \\non how priorities should shift in differing budget scenarios. Congress has \\noften instructed NASA to fund studies on various topics and now regularly \\nincludes language in legislation directing NASA to execute the recommen-\\ndations of SSB decadal surveys. In recent years, excerpts from decadal sur-\\nveys have appeared in congressional authorization legislation, indicating the \\nhigh regard in which members of Congress now hold these reports.\\nThe slow shift in focus from the NAC to the SSB in making program-\\nmatic recommendations represents an interesting dynamic. The NAC is an \\norganization independent from the NASA program offices, but it is internal \\nto NASA. The NASA Administrator has the authority to implement NAC \\nrecommendations, or not, and the council does not publish many formal \\nstudies. The SSB, by contrast, is external to NASA and conducts studies for \\nthe Agency on a contractual basis. Nearly all SSB reports are available to \\nthe public, and the board regularly briefs Congress on findings. As a result, \\n72.

The evaluation involved flying the XV-15 behind, and in \\nclose formation to[,] a quiet research aircraft (the Lockheed YO-3A) which was \\nequipped with microphones and recording equipment. By maintaining the YO-3A \\nmicrophone location at a fixed distance and position with respect to the XV-15 \\nproprotor (shown in figure 60) [not reproduced] corresponding to a microphone \\nlocation in the test section of the wind tunnel, and by operating at the same prop-\\nrotor operating condition, a direct comparison (with corrections for the second \\nproprotor) between the flight data and wind tunnel test data was obtained. This \\nexperiment was conducted by Ames researchers. The tests involved a Bell flight \\ncrew in the XV-15, and a NASA flight crew in the YO-3A.\\nCOMPOSITE PROPROTOR BLADES\\nFrom the very beginning of the TRRA project the proprotor blades were of \\nspecial concern to the Government Project Office. The metal blades used on the \\nXV-15 were designed in the late 1960s under Bell’s IR&D funding for the predeces-\\nsor tilt rotor aircraft, the Bell Model 300. This aircraft had a design gross weight \\nof 12,400 pounds, 600 pounds lighter than that of the XV-15. The concern was \\nthat the proprotors would be too highly loaded, i.e. operating too close to aero-\\ndynamic stall, to provide adequate reserve thrust for control when operating in \\nhover at high gross weights. This could result in a reduction of control effectiveness \\nor the need for a substantial increase in power when operating at the high gross \\nweight condition.\\nFlight tests of the XV-15, however, did not indicate deficiencies. The metal \\nbladed proprotor, although sized for a smaller aircraft, performed well at all XV-\\n15 operating weights and flight conditions. While performance was satisfactory, \\nanother problem emerged that could threaten the future of the XV-15. This was the \\npossibility that one or more blades could become unserviceable or unflightworthy \\ndue to mishandling or deterioration of the blade’s structural integrity.\\nConcern centered on the aft blade section, an aerodynamic fairing constructed \\nof a lightweight aluminum honeycomb core covered with a thin steel skin (figure 61) \\n[not reproduced]. Over the first few years of aircraft operations, minor surface dam-\\nage was incurred due to ground handling. More significantly, small areas of separa-\\ntion of the bond between the skin and the honeycomb was [sic] detected on several \\nblades.

Engineers using linear \\nequations—two-dimensional (2D)—could go only so far. The solving of many \\nvariables using multiple equations concurrently required greater computational \\npower than was available in the predigital age. \\nEngineers at Ames Research Center had long been working to streamline \\nthe process of resolving the problem of Navier-Stokes equations. An early key \\nfigure at Ames was Harvard Lomax, who started experimenting with electronic \\ncomputers from the late 1950s into the 1970s, using them to model the behav-\\nior of blunt-body objects. By 1976, the possibilities of CFD had progressed suf-\\nficiently for Ames Research Center Director Hans Mark to set up a group under \\nengineer F. Ronald Bailey to advance the concept. Using the most powerful \\ncomputers available—at the time the Cray-1 supercomputer—Ames research-\\ners began to break down the equations into usable subparts and establish meth-\\nodologies for resolving multiple variables concurrently. Three years later Ames \\nformed the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator (NAS) Projects Office with \\nthe specific objective of advancing CFD capabilities. Later, Ames also put a \\nCray X-MP and a Cray-2 to use for CFD analysis. Research activities at other \\nNASA Centers also helped to transform the entire field. During this process the \\nILLIAC IV became the first massively parallel computer; it found significant \\nuse in advancing CFD capabilities at Ames Research Center and elsewhere. \\nSome friction quickly emerged between traditionalists who had a strong \\ncommitment to wind tunnel testing and the emerging capabilities of com-\\nputational fluid dynamics. Early on, NASA’s “tunnel rats” resented the rising \\namount of funding invested in CFD research, money that they believed could \\nbe effectively used for wind tunnel work. Only with efforts to make sure that \\nequitable funding existed—and with the training of wind tunnel personnel in \\nCFD techniques—did this begin to change. Over time, it became obvious that \\nCFD provided great capabilities to resolve Navier-Stokes equations, but that \\nwind tunnels were necessary to validate CFD findings. Always, users found \\nthat for all the great capabilities of CFD, at some point there also has to be \\ndemonstration of solutions in the real world. Wind tunnels, often exceedingly \\nsmall ones that used tiny models, were ideal for that purpose.\\nCFD began to pay off in the late 1970s, with the successful redesign of the \\nwing for the HiMAT (Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology) flight test \\nvehicle, a 1/3 scale model of a fighter plane used to test new aerodynamic and \\ncontrol concepts. CFD techniques were also key to the successful retrofitting of \\nthe engines on the Boeing 737, making it one of the most successful passenger \\nairliners in history.

Munk, “On the Problems of Progressive Airship \\nResearch,” in Report on Airship Forum, July 25–26, 1935 (Akron, OH: The \\nDaniel Guggenheim Airship Institute, Publication No. 3, 1935), pp. 89–96.\\nI am very grateful to the Daniel Guggenheim Airship Institute for this oppor-\\ntunity to talk to you, and through you to the rest of the country, about the problems \\nof progressive airship research, for it seems to me very necessary that something be \\nsaid about it at this moment. By the term “progressive” research I mean that study-\\ning, meditating, investigating, and experimenting in scientific spirit, the results \\nof which are intended to inspire the engineer and designer to venture upon and \\nenter into new paths of industrial progress. Advancing along trodden paths, mak-\\ning industrial improvements by emphasizing what seems to be harmful, combin-\\ning what harmonizes, eliminating what is at variance—that too requires careful \\nstudying and experimenting, and a high expert training to do it well. Research \\nalong that line is also very necessary and praiseworthy, no laudable attributes like \\n“fundamental” and the like are too high and too dignified for describing and \\ncharacterizing it. Only, gentlemen, that is not science, but merely requires sci-\\nence, and I will not talk about that now as not being progressive research. There \\nexists, indeed, no sharp demarcation line between the two kinds of research, and \\nthe distinction has to be illustrated by extreme cases. Take this for instance. I am \\ninformed that the Navy, or Army, I have forgotten which (probably both of them), \\nrequires a wind-tunnel test with a model of every airplane type it purchases. It has \\nnow happened that the airplane was delivered long ago and was found satisfac-\\ntory and was performing well, and everything was fine except that the model test \\nwas still missing. The model test was then made after the airplane was already in \\ncommission. Very good. I personally see no reason why not, and the Navy and the \\nArmy generally have good reasons why they do things they are doing; and in this \\ncase the belated model test may still be of great value, in keeping up the statistics \\nand for preparing for a reversal of the process, to make better conclusions from \\ntests to airplanes. What I want to say is merely that that is not progressive research \\nas I now intend to use the word.\\nDiscussing progressive research in a general and broad way is not exactly what a \\ntrue scientist is fond of doing, and I have always tried to be such a scientist. Neither \\nthe polemical nor the speculative is the domain of science, but rather the positive \\nand definite. Speaking of progressive airship research savors of anticipating future \\ndiscoveries and achievements; not the “I found” but “someone will find” is the \\nkeynote of it. A scientist dislikes to assume the part of a prophet, dislikes to predict \\nin such intangible manner. Only strong and forceful reasons can induce him to \\novercome his dislike and to take a larger view of his subject.\\nSuch reasons are now, however, present. These are critical days for the future \\nof American lighter[-]than[-]air development.

       "      <td>\\nThe Space Studies Board (SSB) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAC) are two different entities that provide recommendations to NASA, but they differ in their relationship with NASA and the public availability of their reports.\\n\\nThe NAC is an organization that is internal to NASA, meaning it is part of the agency. The NASA Administrator has the authority to implement NAC recommendations, or not. The NAC does not publish many formal studies, and the recommendations may or may not be made public.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the SSB is external to NASA and conducts studies for the agency on a contractual basis. Nearly all SSB reports are available to the public, and the board regularly briefs Congress on findings.

By \\nthe early 2000s, witnessing the success of the SSB’s decadal survey process \\nfor astronomy and astrophysics, NASA requested that the SSB undertake a \\ndecadal survey for planetary science. The survey provided recommendations \\nfrom the science community on programs within NASA and prioritized the \\nmost important questions in planetary science. Prioritization allowed NASA \\nflexibility in the event of budget cuts, cost overruns, or unexpected circum-\\nstances, and directed the Agency toward a strategy that the planetary sci-\\nence community supported. The survey also explained NASA’s rationale for \\nits programmatic choices to Congress and demonstrated that those choices \\nwere supported by the science community. The planetary survey represented \\na shift in programmatic decision-making for NASA, as it included more \\ndetailed programmatic recommendations than most previous SSB works.\\nThat trend continues with the most recent decadal survey, Vision and \\nVoyages for Planetary Science in the Decades 2013–2022,72 which outlines sci-\\nentific and general programmatic recommendations and includes guidelines \\non how priorities should shift in differing budget scenarios. Congress has \\noften instructed NASA to fund studies on various topics and now regularly \\nincludes language in legislation directing NASA to execute the recommen-\\ndations of SSB decadal surveys. In recent years, excerpts from decadal sur-\\nveys have appeared in congressional authorization legislation, indicating the \\nhigh regard in which members of Congress now hold these reports.\\nThe slow shift in focus from the NAC to the SSB in making program-\\nmatic recommendations represents an interesting dynamic. The NAC is an \\norganization independent from the NASA program offices, but it is internal \\nto NASA. The NASA Administrator has the authority to implement NAC \\nrecommendations, or not, and the council does not publish many formal \\nstudies. The SSB, by contrast, is external to NASA and conducts studies for \\nthe Agency on a contractual basis. Nearly all SSB reports are available to \\nthe public, and the board regularly briefs Congress on findings. As a result, \\n72.

The evaluation involved flying the XV-15 behind, and in \\nclose formation to[,] a quiet research aircraft (the Lockheed YO-3A) which was \\nequipped with microphones and recording equipment. By maintaining the YO-3A \\nmicrophone location at a fixed distance and position with respect to the XV-15 \\nproprotor (shown in figure 60) [not reproduced] corresponding to a microphone \\nlocation in the test section of the wind tunnel, and by operating at the same prop-\\nrotor operating condition, a direct comparison (with corrections for the second \\nproprotor) between the flight data and wind tunnel test data was obtained. This \\nexperiment was conducted by Ames researchers. The tests involved a Bell flight \\ncrew in the XV-15, and a NASA flight crew in the YO-3A.\\nCOMPOSITE PROPROTOR BLADES\\nFrom the very beginning of the TRRA project the proprotor blades were of \\nspecial concern to the Government Project Office. The metal blades used on the \\nXV-15 were designed in the late 1960s under Bell’s IR&amp;D funding for the predeces-\\nsor tilt rotor aircraft, the Bell Model 300. This aircraft had a design gross weight \\nof 12,400 pounds, 600 pounds lighter than that of the XV-15. The concern was \\nthat the proprotors would be too highly loaded, i.e. operating too close to aero-\\ndynamic stall, to provide adequate reserve thrust for control when operating in \\nhover at high gross weights. This could result in a reduction of control effectiveness \\nor the need for a substantial increase in power when operating at the high gross \\nweight condition.\\nFlight tests of the XV-15, however, did not indicate deficiencies. The metal \\nbladed proprotor, although sized for a smaller aircraft, performed well at all XV-\\n15 operating weights and flight conditions. While performance was satisfactory, \\nanother problem emerged that could threaten the future of the XV-15. This was the \\npossibility that one or more blades could become unserviceable or unflightworthy \\ndue to mishandling or deterioration of the blade’s structural integrity.\\nConcern centered on the aft blade section, an aerodynamic fairing constructed \\nof a lightweight aluminum honeycomb core covered with a thin steel skin (figure 61) \\n[not reproduced]. Over the first few years of aircraft operations, minor surface dam-\\nage was incurred due to ground handling. More significantly, small areas of separa-\\ntion of the bond between the skin and the honeycomb was [sic] detected on several \\nblades.

I am \\ninformed that the Navy, or Army, I have forgotten which (probably both of them), \\nrequires a wind-tunnel test with a model of every airplane type it purchases. It has \\nnow happened that the airplane was delivered long ago and was found satisfac-\\ntory and was performing well, and everything was fine except that the model test \\nwas still missing. The model test was then made after the airplane was already in \\ncommission. Very good. I personally see no reason why not, and the Navy and the \\nArmy generally have good reasons why they do things they are doing; and in this \\ncase the belated model test may still be of great value, in keeping up the statistics \\nand for preparing for a reversal of the process, to make better conclusions from \\ntests to airplanes. What I want to say is merely that that is not progressive research \\nas I now intend to use the word.\\nDiscussing progressive research in a general and broad way is not exactly what a \\ntrue scientist is fond of doing, and I have always tried to be such a scientist. Neither \\nthe polemical nor the speculative is the domain of science, but rather the positive \\nand definite. Speaking of progressive airship research savors of anticipating future \\ndiscoveries and achievements; not the “I found” but “someone will find” is the \\nkeynote of it. A scientist dislikes to assume the part of a prophet, dislikes to predict \\nin such intangible manner. Only strong and forceful reasons can induce him to \\novercome his dislike and to take a larger view of his subject.\\nSuch reasons are now, however, present. These are critical days for the future \\nof American lighter[-]than[-]air development.
