As a result, we quickly accumulated important informa-\ntion pertaining to design and flying techniques which, in turn, permitted us to \novercome the numerous difficulties that confronted us, to discover a multitude \nof important facts and, within less than two years of flight experimentation, to \ndevelop a practical helicopter.\nThe high points of this work were as follows:\nAround February or March of 1939, the management of United Aircraft \nCorporation authorized the preparation of drawings of the experimental aircraft. \nDuring the summer, the VS-300 was designed and built. On September 14 of the \nsame year, I made my first hop in the machine. The following spring it became pos-\nsible to remain in the air for fifteen minutes under reasonably satisfactory control \nand on May 6, 1941, a little more than two years after permission was granted to \nbegin preparation of the drawings, the VS-300 brought to the United States a world \nendurance record for helicopters. During this time, four major and a number of \nminor alterations in the design were made and several thousand flights took place.\nIn 1943, I delivered the experimental VS-300 to the Edison Institute Museum \nat Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan, where it is on permanent exhibit.\nThe successful flights of the VS-300 created much interest and resulted in our \nreceiving an order from the United States Army Air Forces for an experimental \ntwo-seater helicopter.\nThis helicopter, the XR-4, was completed, tested and successfully delivered by \nair from Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Dayton, Ohio, in May, 1942. This was the \nfirst cross-country flight ever made in the United States by a helicopter. I had the \ngood fortune to fly as co-pilot a substantial part of the way. It was a most pleas-\nant and comforting feeling to fly the helicopter, knowing that literally any small \ncleared spot could be a landing field and that routes could be checked by stopping \nin the air near a highway sign or by asking information of a passing motorist while \nhovering\u2014which, by the way, we actually did.\nThe craft created a great deal of interest, particularly at the airports. On one \noccasion the landing spot in front of a hangar was purposely overshot and the \nhelicopter flown about thirty feet above and some 100 feet beyond its designated \nlanding place. It was then leisurely backed, stopped in the air, and, finally, very \ngently and slowly, lowered to a perfect landing on the exact spot. One of the airport \nmechanics who witnessed the performance remarked: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m \ncrazy or drunk.\u201d\nThe delivery flight of the XR-4 to Dayton and the subsequent tests and train-\ning of a few Air Force pilots was the next major step in the process of the \u201cheli-\ncopter becoming a reality.\u201d On July 24, 1942, our organization was honored and \nencouraged by a telegram received from Brigadier General Arthur W.

An example or two may be of interest: One time the ship was moored out \nin Lake Washington and an attempt was made to start the engines. Three engines \nstarted nicely but the fourth engine refused to respond. The flight engineer soon \ndetermined that the engine was not getting prime, so one of the crew members went \nout into the nacelle, removed the primer solenoid, operated the valve by hand, and \nthe engine started immediately and the flight test program was carried out. This all \nhappened so quickly that some of the other crew members and those on shore had no \nidea that there had been any trouble. Another time some changes had been made in \nthe engines and the engine service men had no opportunity before flight tests to accu-\nrately set the relief pressure of the relief valve in an engine oil pump before flight tests. \nAfter we had been in the air several minutes that engine was stopped, the relief valve \nremoved, reset, reassembled, and the engine started again. Our scheduled test flight \nwould have been delayed had we not been able to make the final setting in the air.\nThere can be no doubt that the mere fact that you may diagnose the trouble, \neven though no repairs can be made, is of tremendous value. For example, on one \nflight quite a quantity of hot engine oil was found leaking on the deck. It would \nbe natural to suppose that one of the engine oil systems had failed, but with all \nlines accessible, it was quickly discovered that there was a loose connection on the \nvacuum system oil separator drain line. A method of catching this oil was quickly \nrigged up and the flight continued. If no diagnosis could have been made, the crew \nwould have been obliged to land the aircraft under the circumstances.\nAll tanks, valves and the greater portion of the plumbing for the engine lubri-\ncation, deicer fluid, hydraulic oil, water vacuum and fuel systems are accessible in \nflight. This means that inspections may be made periodically during flight and \ntrouble discovered before it reaches dangerous proportions. It is believed this type \nof design contributes immeasurably to the efficiency and safety of operation so \nnecessary for long-range flights.\nBased, in part, on the provisions for the crew and on the ease of inspection and \nmaintenance, we conclude that the second requirement for efficiency of operations \nis fulfilled.\nWe now come to our third design criteria [sic] and, naturally, the one which \nmost concerns the traffic departments: the passenger accommodations.

During the 1920s and 1930s, they \nenjoyed a golden age during which most experts felt that these aircraft would make \nmany fundamental and long-lasting contributions to aviation. Some enthusiasts \neven felt that they would become a predominant form of aircraft and monopolize \ncertain aviation missions and arenas. Commercial, military, and government estab-\nlishments dedicated substantial resources to their development; as we have already \nseen, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, for one, focused consider-\nable attention on both through regular subcommittees devoted to their advance-\nment. As aircraft technologies progressed generally, the form of the airship and the \nflying boat improved as well. Both types contributed to aviation\u2019s projection of \nmilitary and commercial power in the pre\u2013World War II era, and both launched a \nnumber of airline routes, including the first transoceanic ones. So important were \nthese two types of aircraft that it is impossible to understand aviation development \nbefore 1940 without paying attention to the roles fulfilled by these machines.\nAs the airship and flying boat passed into twilight, another form of aircraft \ncame out of the shadows. This was the rotary-wing machine, notably the helicop-\nter: a vehicle that could have radically affected the course of World War II combat \nif it had been available. Not that it was a brand new invention after 1945; that was \nhardly the case. Helicopter pioneer Igor Sikorsky believed that \u201c[t]he idea of a vehicle \nthat could lift itself vertically off the ground and hover in the air was probably born \nat the same time that man first dreamed of flying.\u201d8 As we will see in Documents \n5-30 through 5-35, a significant amount of work had been done to advance the \nscience and technology of vertical flight long before World War II. But researchers \nhad not solved enough of the enormous technical problems to turn rotary-wing air-\ncraft into practical machinery. This was particularly true for the helicopter, a type \nof heavier-than-air craft in which lift was obtained by means of one or more power-\ndriven rotors and that sought to achieve a magnificent flight capability that no other \n8 Quoted in J.

Hence, most asteroid diameter estimates begin with a \ndetermination of the asteroid\u2019s absolute magnitude, and then a likely albedo is \nassumed to estimate the diameter\u2014a process that can lead to large uncertain-\nties in their size estimates.\nFor a small number of asteroids, the diameter can be directly inferred \nfrom stellar occultation measurements, whereby observers in diverse locations \nobserve and record the time intervals when the starlight blinks out (or not) \nas the asteroid passes in front of (or near) the star. With observers located at \nslightly different latitudes and a knowledge of the asteroid\u2019s orbital motion in \nspace, the recorded occultation time intervals can be converted to linear chord \nmeasures (or at least partial measures) of the asteroid\u2019s two-dimensional shape. \nThis technique was well known as early as 1952, when MIT\u2019s Gordon Taylor \nbegan issuing predictions, but limited opportunities to observe occultations \nand a lack of equipment and observers meant progress was very slow.

A second smaller burst \nwas received at 21:26 UT on 14 June followed by \nsix more bursts by 9 July 2015, after which time \nRosetta was no longer in range to receive data from \nPhilae. A year after landing, in November 2015, \nmission teams still remained hopeful that there \nwould be renewed contact with the lander, espe-\ncially as the Rosetta orbiter began to approach the \nlander again. But in February 2016, ESA \nannounced that it was unlikely that Rosetta would \never pick up any more signals from Philae again, \npartly due to failures in a transmitter and a receiver \non board. On 5 September 2016, ESA announced \nthat they had conclusively identified the landing \nsite of Philae in images taken by Rosetta\u2019s OSIRIS \nnarrow-angle camera when the orbiter approached \nto just 2.7 kilometers of the surface. Rosetta, \nmeanwhile, had continued its primary mission \norbiting Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as \nthe comet itself arced closer to the Sun. In \nNovember 2014, the orbiter adjusted its orbit sev-\neral times to position it about 30 kilometers above \nthe comet, interrupted by a brief \u201cdip\u201d down to 20 \nkilometers for about 10 days in early December. \nOn 4 February 2015, Rosetta began moving into a \nnew path for an encounter, timed for 12:41 UT on \n14 February, at a range of just six kilometers. The \nflyby took the spacecraft over the most active \nregions of the comet, allowing scientists to seek \nzones where gas and dust accelerates from the sur-\nface. In June 2015, ESA extended Rosetta\u2019s mis-\nsion to at least September 2016 (an extension of \nnine months from its original \u201cnominal\u201d mission). \nDuring this extension, Rosetta was party to Comet \n67P/C-G\u2019s closest approach to the Sun, a distance \nof 186 million kilometers, on 13 August 2015. At \nthe perihelion, gases and dust particles around the \ncomet reached peak intensity, clearly visible in the \nmany spectacular images sent back by the orbiter. \nFinally, at 20:50 UT on 30 September 2016, \nRosetta carried out a final maneuver sending it on \na collision course with the comet from a height of \n19 kilometers. During the descent, Rosetta stud-\nied the comet\u2019s gas, dust, and plasma environment \nvery close to the surface and took numerous \nhigh-resolution images.

Irwin \nShapiro and colleagues considered radar data in their orbital analysis of Icarus \nto compare (and confirm) its perihelion advance with the predictions from \ngeneral\u00a0relativity.48\nThere were successful Goldstone radar observations of 1685 Toro in 1972 \nand of 433 Eros three years later.49 For the latter observations, two frequen-\ncies were broadcast and received in two opposite circular polarizations. Since a \ncircularly polarized signal would reverse sense upon reflection from a smooth \nobject, information on the object\u2019s surface roughness was obtained by not-\ning to what extent a particular circular polarization had been reversed when \nreceived. The surface of Eros was determined to be rougher than the lunar \nsurface, with total dimensions 37.2 and 15.8 kilometers\u2014not too different \nfrom the actual dimensions of 34 by 11 by 11 kilometers determined by the \n46.

Four generations of flying wing\u2013shaped HALE \nUAVs (Pathfinder, Pathfinder Plus, Centurion, and Helios), built in collabo-\nration with cutting-edge aeronautical firm AeroVironment, relied upon solar \ncells, electric motors, and composite construction to achieve flights at record-\nbreaking altitudes of up to 96,000 feet.

Increases in the rotor \nfigure of merit as high as 6 or 7 percent have been demonstrated over an improved \nrotor having symmetrical airfoil sections. Leading-edge roughness of the type that \nhas been experienced in some helicopter operations is shown to reduce the hover-\ning efficiency drastically. The gains associated with camber, however, are retained \nover the symmetrical airfoil with standard leading-edge roughness applied. The \nadvantages of camber in this particular case tended to disappear above rotor-blade \ntip Mach numbers of 0.6.\nA simple presentation of available helicopter rotor hovering data obtained over a \nbroad range of airfoil sections, blade-tip Mach numbers, and pitch angles indicates \nFIGURE 11.

The MC-1 Fastrac PTA, like the initial design of the Fastrac engine, \nlikewise was a point design concept due to lack of specific vehicle or mission \ndefinitions.

Add to these \nimprovements an air diaphragm or \u201cballonet\u201d to maintain constant pressure inside \nthe gas envelope and hold it taut, as well as a control car suspended beneath the \nenvelope, and one had the essential elements of the modern nonrigid or \u201cblimp\u201d-\ntype airship.

The NACA-sponsored propeller program conducted by two Stanford \nUniversity professors is an excellent case study of that relationship.12\nUntil the completion of Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in June \n1920, the NACA coordinated and conducted all of its experimental research \nthrough contracts with research universities.

So they put their time into \na pair of informal studies that drew on what they had learned about sample \nreturn over the previous two years of effort. This short period of time and \nthought had profound effects on the architecture of sample return and on \ntechnologies they conceived of as necessary to accomplish it.\nTHE \u201cBUBBLE TEAM\u201d AND LARGE-LANDER STUDIES\nDuring the short life of the sample-return project, many of the engineers \ninvolved had reached the conclusion that the basic architecture they were \nusing was deeply flawed. Whatever might have gone wrong with Polar Lander, \nthey no longer believed the Lockheed Martin lander could be scaled up so \nmuch, so easily. The lander\u2019s legs could not be scaled up enough to provide \nmuch ground clearance due to constraints imposed by the size of available \nlaunch-vehicle aerodynamic shrouds, rendering the lander vulnerable to \nrocks. Longer legs also would leave the lander vulnerable to a \u201ctip-over\u201d prob-\nlem. As the rover would start to move across the lander deck, the vehicle would \nsee a center-of-gravity shift that might tip the whole thing over, especially if it \nhad landed on a sloped surface. And there were still more problems. So they \nset out to find a new architecture that would resolve some of these challenges.\nThe effort to conceive a better Mars landing method was embedded \nwithin a JPL Mars Exploration Office\u2013initiated review of sample return. \nSet up in February 2000, the review\u2019s purpose was actually to protect the \nsample-return architecture from being reviewed externally\u2014perhaps by \nJohnson Space Center, which wanted a role in any Mars sample-return effort \nbut had not gained much of a foothold in the sample-return effort as it was \nbeing implemented in 2000. So the review was structured to prevent major \nchanges to the architecture, which might then be used as justification for \nreassessing institutional roles. Separate teams were to review each compo-\nnent of the mission\u2014the Earth return vehicle, the lander, the Mars ascent \nvehicle.

The chevron nozzle is a type of nozzle with serrated edges that helps to reduce jet noise by promoting the mixing of high-speed jet exhaust with the surrounding air. This is achieved by creating a series of small shockwaves that scatter and dissipate the noise energy.\n\nThe AIAA Papers mentioned in the context information provide evidence of the effectiveness of chevron nozzles in reducing jet noise. For example, Paper 2005-2934 by Vinod G. Mengle discusses the jet noise characteristics of chevrons in internally mixed nozzles, while Paper 2006-2467 by Vinod G. Mengle, Ronen Elkoby, Leon Brusniak, and Russ H.

Butler, and James H. Mabe discusses the use of variable geometry chevrons for jet noise reduction. This suggests that the chevron nozzle can be further optimized for noise reduction by adjusting the geometry of the chevrons.\n\nGibson's \"The Chevron Nozzle\" provides a comprehensive overview of the chevron nozzle and its applications in jet noise reduction. According to Gibson, chevron nozzles have been used in commercial aircraft engines since the 1990s and have been shown to reduce jet noise by up to 10 decibels. Gibson also notes that chevron nozzles have been used in military aircraft, such as the F-15 and F-16, to reduce noise and improve stealth capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the Chevron Nozzle is a significant technology in jet noise reduction, as evidenced by various AIAA Papers and Gibson's \"The Chevron Nozzle\".

The Vision was predicated on an overall increase in the NASA \nbudget of about $3 billion per year, with the rest of the cost of a return to the \nMoon to be borne by shutting down the Space Shuttle Program in 2010 and \ndiverting its funding line to the new Moon program. An almost immediate \nrevolt against the idea from within the President\u2019s own party ensured that it \nwas never fully funded, and heavy-lift launch vehicle development started with \nmuch less than its anticipated financing and never did acquire full funding.50 \nThis situation caused NASA leaders to begin raiding other budgets to fund \nthe Moon program. At a meeting in May 2005, NASA\u2019s Mars program staff \nfound that the Mars program\u2019s contribution to the new lunar effort would be \nabout $3 billion over the next five years. NASA\u2019s FY 2006 budget runout had \nprojected the Mars budget increasing to nearly $1.3 billion per year by 2010.51 \nUnder the new budget plan, Mars would receive only $648 million in fiscal \nyear 2010.

Unlike the operational GEODSS telescopes that NEAT shared with \nother Air Force efforts in Maui, the ETS telescopes were for research; the \nLincoln Labs used them to try out new sensor technologies. The large-format, \nfast-transfer CCD cameras that Stokes intended to use had been specifically \ndeveloped as a potential upgrade for the operational GEODSS telescopes, so \ncompatibility with the telescopes was never an issue. A prototype of the new \ncamera and processing system was tested in August 1995 and July 1996 at \nETS, just a few months before NEAT began observing on Haleakal\u0101. The \nJuly 1996 test series netted LINEAR its first NEO, 1996 MQ.29\nThe success of the test series garnered Air Force funding to develop the com-\nplete LINEAR system. In mid-1997, a nearly complete system with a smaller \nCCD underwent further trials at ETS; the large-format CCD was installed \nthat summer, and in October of 1997, a 10-night observing campaign gener-\nated 52,542 observations and netted 9 confirmed new NEOs. Over the course \nof 1998, LINEAR became the dominant discoverer of near-Earth asteroids, \nand in 1999, it expanded further by equipping another of the ETS telescopes. \nIt was so prolific that it overwhelmed the ability of follow-up observers to keep \nup with its new discoveries and had to reprogram some of its observing time \nto follow up its own discoveries, reducing its sky coverage to an extent.30 But \nit remained the dominant survey through 2005. After 1998, though, Stokes \nhad to begin drawing NASA funds from the NEO Observations Program to \nmaintain operations.

In all, five of the seven Surveyor spacecraft \ncompleted their missions.\nWhile all of this activity took place, teams of scientists assessed the potential \nfor landing sites for the Apollo program. Everyone had their favorite locations, \nand teams contended for decisions in favor of their first choices. Some wanted \nto go to mountain ranges that promised unique types of geology. Others, espe-\ncially engineers more concerned about the difficulties of landing in mountain-\nous terrain, argued for the open expanses of the flatter terrain. These debates \ncontinued throughout the Apollo program, with more daring and geologically \ninteresting sites added to later missions as experience overcame earlier fears. \nLikewise, the astronauts who were to conduct these lunar landing missions \nhad to be taught the basics of lunar geology and how to undertake fieldwork \non the Moon. Most of them had little background in geology, but scientists \noffered them what amounted to an intensive M.S.-level education in lunar geol-\nogy.

All scientific instrumentation on the \nspacecraft were mounted on a movable scan plat-\nform \u201cunderneath\u201d the main bodies.

(Another firing on the fourth revolution \naround Mars refined the orbit to 1,394 \u00d7 17,144 \nkilometers at 64.34\u00b0 inclination). The primary goal \nof the mission was to map about 70% of the surface \nduring the first three months of operation.

The J85 was one \nof GE\u2019s most successful engines. Small and powerful at 3,000 pounds of thrust, \nit had the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any American-built jet engine. GE \nhad based its compressor on an experimental five-stage NASA design, which \nincluded high-stage loading technology.29 The American military used the \nengine in a wide range of aircraft that included the Northrop T-38 Talon and \nF-5 fighter family, the North American T-2 Buckeye trainer, and the Cessna \nA-37 Dragonfly (a trainer modified for light attack). Comprehensive testing \nestablished the desired transonic nozzle inlet temperature and pressure and \ngas flow rate, which allowed researchers to determine the J85\u2019s gross thrust \nwithin a margin of error of less than 1 percent. With the methodology in \nplace, they could rationalize the testing of new nozzle and compressor designs \nand noise-reduction technology not only for future tests in the PSL, but also \nin test aircraft and other facilities, using the known characteristics of the J85 \nas a baseline.30\nNASA placed new emphasis on increasing the performance of turbofans \nin the early 1960s, seeking as well to reduce their noise to make them com-\nmercially practical. The turbojets that powered the first commercial airliners \nconsumed large amounts of fuel in relation to the distances they carried aircraft, \nwhich affected airline revenues and operating costs. The addition of a large, \nenclosed, multiblade fan to a turbojet harnessed the efficiency of the propeller \nwhile developing the high thrust of the turbojet. The unprecedented 60- to \n80-percent leap in efficiency increased thrust, improved fuel economy, and \nreduced noise. The introduction of the new \u201cturbofan\u201d facilitated the success of \nlow-cost, long-distance air transportation and military flight in the early 1960s.\nThe first practical American turbofan engine, General Electric\u2019s \n16,000-pound-thrust CJ805-23 aft-fan, was ready for flight in 1959. It resulted \nfrom considerable pioneering research and financial expense on the part of \nboth GE and the NACA, primarily in the newly emerging field of CFD. \nUnfortunately, the airplane it was destined to power, the Convair 990 airliner, \nwas not yet ready. The delay worked against the subsequent market success \nof the CJ805, allowing rival Pratt & Whitney time to catch up with a rival \nfront-fan design, the JT3D.

One of his rotors was to provide lift, the \nother propulsion.\nWith such a start, one should hardly be surprised that the pace of experiments \nrelated to vertical flight picked up greatly in the 19th century. Sir George Cayley, \nwho developed the concept of the modem airplane, also constructed several vertical-\nflight models in the early 1800s. Driven by wound-up clock springs, Cayley\u2019s little \nhelicopters actually flew pretty well, if only for short distances and only a few feet \nabove the ground. In the 1840s, Horatio Phillips, another Englishman, tried to get \na larger machine straight off the ground. A miniature boiler forced steam through \nthe tips of a rotor blade, trying to lift the entire device up. Though his attempt \nfailed, Phillips\u2019s effort marked the first time that anyone pursued a helicopter using \nthe power generated by a real engine rather than the stored-up energy of wound-\nup string or springs. The first recorded use of the term \u201chelicopter\u201d surfaced in \nthe 1860s, when Vicomte Ponton D\u2019Am\u00e9court called his small experimental flying \nmachines les h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res, a word he derived from the Greek elikoeioas, meaning \u201cspi-\nral or winding,\u201d and pteron, meaning \u201cfeather or wing.\u201d The viscount also tried to \npower a large model with steam. He failed, but his endeavor fascinated compatriot \nJules Verne, who later, in his novel The Clipper of the Clouds (1886), described a \ngiant helicopter-like machine that gracefully cruised the skies thanks to lift pro-\nvided by 37 small coaxial rotors.\nIf situated in the second half of the 19th century, without the awareness of \nthe many difficulties to come, one might have believed from the degree of enter-\nprise in the technology that rotary-wing aircraft and vertical flight might succeed \nas the first form of powered heavier-than-air flight. Vertical flight models were \nbuilt and tested all over Europe from the 1860s on: by Henry Bright in England \n(1861), Gabrielle de La Landelle in France (1863), Alexander Nikolaevich Lodygin \nin Russia (1869), Alphonse P\u00e9naud in France (1870), Wilhelm von Achenbach in \nGermany (1874), Dieuaide in France (1877), and Enrico Forlanini in Italy (1878), \namong others. (The NACA actually published a paper by Achenbach on his experi-\nments with propellers in 1923, as Technical Note 131.) Many of these models flew \nshort distances, but none of them possessed any effective means of control. Even \nThomas Alva Edison experimented with the helicopter. First, he tested various \nrotor configurations driven by a little internal combustion engine that had been \npowering a cotton gin; but not surprisingly, he quickly turned to the possibility \nof using an electric motor. Beginning this work in the 1880s, he continued it at \nleast until 1910, when he patented his design for a full-scale helicopter having box-\nkite-like blades, a machine that never got built. Still, the great American inventor \nwas the first experimenter to realize that for a helicopter to hover efficiently, the \ndiameter of the rotor needed to be relatively large. Besides that, the rotor needed to \nbe highly efficient aerodynamically and required a high-power engine to drive it."], "reference_answer": "\nThe first person to use the term \"helicopter\" was Vicomte Ponton D'Am\u00e9court, a French inventor.

The scoop on the sampler\u2019s arm was used numerous times for picking up soil and digging trenches, and for conducting at least 16 surface-bearing tests. Communications were paused with Surveyor VII at 14:12 UT on 26 January 1968, about 80 hours after sunset. Second lunar day operations began at 19:01 UT on 12 February 1968, and extended to 00:24 UT on 21 February effectively ending the mission. In total, the five successful Surveyors returned more than 87,000 photos of the lunar surface and operated for about 17 months total on the lunar surface, and most important, demonstrated the feasibility of soft-landing a spacecraft on the lunar surface.", "reference_answer_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}}, {"query": "Who was the Discovery Program Scientist at NASA Headquarters from 2002 to 2006?", "query_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}, "reference_contexts": ["NASA\u2032s Discovery Program\nxvi\nThe creation of the New Frontiers mission line shows that, although the Discovery \nProgram was no longer particularly fast or cheap, it was very successful in producing \ninnovative and original proposals that maximized science return for focused planetary \nscience projects.

Niebur was the Discovery Program Scientist at NASA Headquarters \nfrom 2002 to 2006. A PhD physicist who had written a dissertation on galactic cos-\nmic rays, she had looked for a job at the space agency out of pure enthusiasm for it. \nShe won a Presidential Management Internship there in 2001 and moved on to the \nDiscovery position only one year later. As a young woman, she already stood out in a \nplace dominated by aging, predominantly male civil servants. She had come with her \nhusband, Curt Niebur, who came to Headquarters shortly after her and is still today \na leading administrator in the Planetary Science Division. But when they began to \nhave children, she found the work arrangements too inflexible. She quit and formed \nher own consulting company, as well as taking a leading role in encouraging young \nwomen who were planetary scientists, and early-career scientists generally, to orga-\nnize and change the discipline. She founded the Women in Planetary Science website \nand the annual women\u2019s breakfast at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference \nin Houston. Both continue to promote career advancement and networking today.8\nIn 2007, Susan Niebur won a NASA grant to write a history of the Discovery \nProgram, the origin of this book. She also published several articles from her research \nand personal knowledge of the subject, focusing particularly on the role of the PI. Very \nunfortunately, she never finished the book manuscript, as she tragically died at age \n38 in early 2012 after a five-year struggle with cancer. That story is told by this book\u2019s \neditor, David W. Brown, in his engrossing work on the origin of a mission to explore \nJupiter\u2019s moon Europa.

He replaced \nthe Science Mission Director he had inherited with Wesley Huntress, and \nlater\u2014when Huntress left\u2014with Ed Weiler. He found them both able and \nsupportive of his Mars goals. \nGoldin was retained as NASA Administrator by President Bill Clinton \nbecause Goldin\u2019s faster, better, cheaper efficiency approach to program man-\nagement fit well with Clinton\u2019s, and especially Vice President Al Gore\u2019s, desire \nto launch a reinventing-government campaign. Goldin ultimately became \ntheir poster boy for the White House (and congressional) drive to accom-\nplish more for less. He also endeared himself to the White House through his \nleadership in the International Space Station Program. He was responsive to \nthe White House, and so the White House was responsive to him. \nThe occasion for a big decision involving the Red Planet came in 1993 \nwhen NASA\u2019s Mars Observer, an orbiter, failed as it approached Mars. \nRather than lamenting the loss, Goldin used it to initiate a new Mars \nSurveyor program based on faster, better, cheaper principles. Calling Mars \nObserver a $1\u00a0billion Battlestar Galactica, Goldin said his new program \nwould lower cost and risk. Instead of putting all experiments in one probe, \nNASA would divide them into smaller spacecraft sent every 26 months, \nwhen the Mars-Earth alignment was optimal. Getting a \u201cprogram line\u201d in \nthe budget approved by the White House and Congress was important to \nthis fast-paced strategy. In selling the concept of a long-term program to \nthe White House Office of Management and Budget and Congress, Goldin \nand his Science Associate Administrator, Wesley Huntress, argued that they \nwould get more science done in a less costly way.3 Mars exploration thus \nbecame an ongoing effort, with one mission setting the stage for the next. \nGoldin said that the robotic Mars Surveyor program, as it was called, was a \nshowcase for his faster, better, cheaper product line.

The literature \n(refs. 18 to 20) indicates a similar increment from a clean wheel-type gear. The \npenalty for a dirty-wheel arrangement can be several times this increment. The data \nprovide good arguments for cleaning up or completely retracting the landing gear \nof a high-performance helicopter.\nThe Reynolds number of the tubular gear, based on the cylinder diameter, was \nbelow the critical value for the model tests. A consideration of the full-scale landing \ngear that it was patterned after indicates that it, too, would be below the critical \nReynolds number for cruising speeds below 110 knots.\nThe fuselage and pylon parasite-drag values shown are not at all representative \nof current helicopters, which customarily penalize an already poor aerodynamic \nshape with additional drag from leakage and nonflush doors, windows, hatches, \nand other protuberances which not only contribute their own drag but also cause \nflow separation on the basic fuselage.\nAdditional preliminary lift and drag data obtained from the 1\u20445-scale model \ntests are given in figures 8 and 9. From figure 8 it is seen that minimum equivalent \nflat-plate parasite-drag areas of fuselage shapes A and C of the order of 1 square foot \nwere measured.

The autogiros fall \nquite behind.\nI should like to point out at this place that my high opinion of the helicopter \nis not necessarily based entirely on the proof of its equal or higher climb and speed \nperformance as compared with the airplane. The helicopter is justified by its pecu-\nliar properties which determine its special purposes. It is all the more advantageous \nthat it is at least not very inferior to the airplane.\nSo far, we have considered the extensive knowledge that was necessary for the \ndevelopment of a helicopter. Again it must be emphasized to what a large extent \nscience has formed the basis for building up the new knowledge. The second and \nstill more difficult part of our task consisted in putting this knowledge to practical \napplication in design, construction, and testing.\nThe first step was the construc-\ntion of a free flying model (fig. 6). It \nwas driven by a 0.7-hp. two-stroke-\ncycle engine and with 50 gallons of \ngasoline had a gross weight of 4.9 kg. \nIt will be understood that it was \nmore often apart than together but it \nnevertheless furnished us with many \nvaluable experiences.

If it be assumed that \nthis ratio is sustained unchanged when the axis is slightly inclined it appears that \nan inclination of about 10\u00b0 would be necessary in order that the resultant of T and \nY might be vertical when the helicopter was advancing rapidly. This, however, is \nnot sufficient, as R is yet to be overcome. The total resistance of fuselage, propeller \nshafts, and structure (not including the propellers) at 60 m.p.h. should not exceed \none-twentieth of the weight of the helicopter, and the additional tilt necessary to \novercome the resistance at this speed would therefore be 3\u00b0, making a total of 13\u00b0. \nThe angle of yaw is then 77\u00b0.\nUnfortunately there are no data available for such angles of yaw as this. \nRiabouchinsky\u2019s experiments cover (not entirely satisfactorily in the light of mod-\nern practice) the case of 90\u00b0 yaw, and the only other experiments which have been \npublished are some made by the N.P.L. on propulsive screws at angles of yaw [of] \nup to 25\u00b0. The working conditions of propellers at small angles of yaw and those \nat 90\u00b0 are entirely different, and it is difficult to interpolate between two sets of \nexperiments so diverse as those just mentioned. At 90\u00b0 yaw, as has just been pointed \nout, the angle of attack is almost independent of the rate of advance, and the thrust \nincreases steadily as the speed of advance increases. When there is little or no yaw, \non the other hand, the rate of advance has an important and direct effect on the \nangles of attack of the blade elements and the thrust falls off rapidly with increas-\ning speed. In order that a helicopter may be suitable for use in all ordinary weather \nconditions it must be capable of maintaining a forward speed nearly or quite equal \nto the tip speed of the propellers. This is quite hopeless if the thrust is to fall off rap-\nidly as the speed increases, and not even the provision of a variable pitch propeller \nwould make it possible to secure sustentation and propulsion at high speeds under \nsuch conditions. It is possible, however, that when the inclination of the axis from \nthe vertical is only ten or fifteen degrees the rate of change of the angle of attack \nwith changing speed will be small enough so that high speeds can be attained."], "reference_answer": "6", "reference_answer_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}}, {"query": "What are some of the key factors that contribute to the success of a space mission, as highlighted by the experiences of the Genesis, CONTOUR, and MESSENGER projects?", "query_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}, "reference_contexts": ["NASA\u2032s Discovery Program\n366\nmuch more reluctant to claim direct heritage, and the review boards repeatedly extolled \nthe merit of this decision, particularly in cases where a technology or system had not \nyet flown.

Means of accomplishing \nmoment changes and thrust vector tilts are discussed below for the flapping and \nrigid type rotors.\nControl by Tilting the Rotor Hub. If the hub of either a rigid or flapping \nrotor is tilted with respect to fuselage, as in Fig. 2-8a, a change in the direction of \nthe thrust vector results. In the normal engine-driven helicopter, it is mechanically \nawkward to tilt the hub, since the hub is a rotating structure to which large torque \nloads are applied. Control by tilting the hub is limited primarily to jet propelled \nrotors and autogyro rotors where no torque is transmitted to the hub.\nControl by Cyclic-Pitch Change. The conventional way of achieving control \nin both rigid and flapping rotors is through cyclic-pitch change. This is usually \naccomplished by a linkage from the blades to a \u201cswash plate,\u201d which is a rotating \nplane that defines the pitch of the blades (Fig. 2-10). The blades are mounted on \n\u201cfeathering\u201d bearings and are free to follow the swash plate in pitch. With cyclic-\npitch control, the effect of a sudden swash-plate tilt is fundamentally different for \nflapping and rigid rotors. For rigid blades, a swash-plate tilt produces a moment \nabout the rotor hub in the direction of the \nswash-plate tilt, owing to the difference in \nlift on the feathered blades (Fig. 2-14). For \nflapping blades with hinges on the axis of \nrotation, a swash-plate tilt results in a tilt \nof the rotor vector. Because the blades are \nfreely hinged, no moments may be trans-\nmitted, and the swash-plate tilt has the \nsame effect as a corresponding shaft tilt \n(Fig. 2-9c). When the flapping hinges are \nmoved outboard, the tilt of the rotor caused \nby a swash-plate tilt results in a moment \nabout the hub as well as a thrust vector tilt. This moment is caused by the blade \nmass forces acting on the hub.\nAlternative Means of Accomplishing Cyclic-Pitch Change. In addition to the \ndirect swash-plate linkage discussed above, blade pitch change may be accomplished \nby connecting the swash plate \nto a servo-tab on each blade, \nas in Fig. 2-15, or connect-\ning the swash plate to a servo-\nrotor which in turn acts as the \nswash plate for the main rotor \nFIG. 2-14.

In practice, however, the project manager must \noversee the design, formulation, integration, testing, and preparation for launch of \na spacecraft that may cost over half a billion dollars at launch. The role of a project \nmanager is a challenging one, encompassing skills as varied as technical insight; cost \ncontainment; institutional advocacy; and the management, directly or indirectly, of \nthe efforts of up to a thousand people per mission.\nDefinition\nAt first, the Discovery Program did not define the role of project manager, leaving it \nup to the PI to define. The first AO, however, did note that the project manager should \noversee the technical implementation of the mission and that the project manager should \nhave sufficient role and experience to meet the technical needs of the investigation.13\nEvolution\nThe loose definition of the project manager\u2019s role solidified over time, and requirements \nwere added for the project manager to be named, for the role to be clearly defined in \nthe proposal, and eventually for NASA to approve the project manager at each major \nmilestone review. Principal Investigators were strongly encouraged at later points in \nthe program to name a deputy program manager or an alternate project manager at \nthe time of proposal. These stricter requirements or recommendations arose as a result \nof lessons learned from previous missions.\nIn the early missions, it was not uncommon for the same project manager to take \na mission from proposal to launch. Stardust, for example, had that continuity, which \nenabled the mission leadership to keep tight rein on requirements and fight scope \ncreep. In later missions, however, project managers, named as part of the proposing \nteam, began to disappear after selection, to be replaced by unexpected players.

From the consideration of the circulation \nalong a closed line enclosing the vortex tube, we see that this circulation\u2014i.e., \nthe strength of our vortex tube\u2014has the same value at all times. Thus we have \nobtained the theorems of Helmholtz, which now can be expressed as follows, call-\ning the contents of a vortex tube a \u201cvortex filament\u201d: \u201cThe particles of a fluid which \nat any instant belong to a vortex filament always remain in it; the strength of a vor-\ntex filament throughout its extent and for all time has the same value.\u201d From this \nfollows, among other things, that if a portion of the filament is stretched, say, to \ndouble its length, and thereby its cross section made one-half as great, then the rota-\ntion is doubled, because the strength of the vortex, the product of the rotation and \nthe cross section, must remain the same. We arrive, therefore, at the result that the \nvector expressing the rotation is changed in magnitude and direction exactly as the \ndistance between two neighboring particles on the axis of the filament is changed.\n8. From the way the strengths of vortices have been defined it follows for a \nspace filled with any arbitrary vortex filaments, as a consequence of a known theo-\nrem of Stokes, that the circulation around any closed line is equal to the algebraic \nsum of the vortex strengths of all the filaments which cross a surface having the \nclosed line as its boundary. If this closed line is in any way continuously changed \nso that filaments are thereby cut, then evidently the circulation is changed, accord-\ning to the extent of the strengths of the vortices which are cut. Conversely we may \nconclude from the circumstance that the circulation around a closed line (which \nnaturally can not be a fluid line) is changed by a definite amount by a certain dis-\nplacement, that by the displacement vortex strength of this amount will be cut, or \nexpressed differently, that the surface passed over by the closed line in its displace-\nment is traversed by vortex filaments whose strengths add up algebraically to the \namount of the change in the circulation.\nThe theorems concerning vortex motion are specially important because in \nmany cases it is easier to make a statement as to the shape of the vortex filaments \nthan as to the shape of the stream lines, and because there is a mode of calculation \nby means of which the velocity at any point of the space may be determined from \na knowledge of the distribution of the rotation. This formula, so important for us, \nmust now be discussed. If \u0393 is the strength of a thin vortex filament and ds an ele-\nment of its medial line, and if, further, r is the distance from the vortex element to \na point P at which the velocity is to be calculated, finally if \u03b1 is the angle between \nds and r, then the amount of the velocity due to the vortex element is\n \ndv = \u0393 ds sin \u03b1\n4 \u03c0 r2 ; \n(6)\nthe direction of this contribution to the velocity is perpendicular to the plane of \nds and r.

The circulation theorem states that the circulation, or the strength of the vortex tube, has the same value at all times. This means that if a portion of the filament is stretched, the rotation is doubled, and the vector expressing the rotation is changed in magnitude and direction exactly as the distance between two neighboring particles on the axis of the filament is changed. The circulation theorem also states that the circulation around any closed line is equal to the algebraic sum of the vortex strengths of all the filaments which cross a surface having the closed line as its boundary. This is important because it allows for the calculation of the velocity at any point in the space based on the distribution of the rotation. The formula for this calculation is given by equation (6) in the context, which states that the amount of the velocity due to a vortex element is proportional to the strength of the vortex, the element of its medial line, and the sine of the angle between the element and the distance from the vortex element to the point where the velocity is to be calculated.

In fact, there was no agreement as to design. Some used coaxial rotors \n(two rotors turning in opposite directions on the same shaft). Some used side by \nside rotors; some had four lifting rotors. Oe[h]michen made over 1,000 flights in a \nmachine with four lifting rotors and nine auxiliary propellers. There was even one \ndesign in the form of a maple seed. And, as I later learned, Isacco had a large single \nrotor turned by propellers and engines on the ends of the blades.\nIn any case, in 1928 the helicopter was an interesting challenge and I was \nintrigued by the possibility suggested by Flettner\u2019s design for a large windmill, of a \nsingle rotor with propellers at the tips.\nI went back to Radnor, Pennsylvania, with the determination to try this idea. \nAt a toy store I found rubber bands, carved wooden propellers, light balsa wood \nstrips, Japanese silk, and dope (lacquer) and soon had made a model helicopter, \nabout six feet in diameter.\nIt flew nicely but with short duration, indicating that a helicopter would require \nmore power than an airplane.\nFor the next nine years \nI struggled with this design. \nDuring the first phase of the work \nI developed the use of models \npowered by electric motors (the \nmodel technique became impor-\ntant later). During this period \nthe most significant development \nwas a whirling arm with which I \ncould make accurate tests of propeller efficiency. I also built equipment to measure \nthe lift and horsepower of the electric model and discovered the formulas to predict \nlift and horsepower for full scale.\nI next undertook a larger machine. Since I had neither facilities nor finances \nfor a full-scale model, I decided on an intermediate 20-horsepower machine, which \nI purposely made small in order to achieve high power density.

The lander would also have \na solid-fuel rocket intended to fire the sample container into a low Mars orbit \n(see figure 2). In 2005, a CNES-built orbiter would reach Mars, collect the \nsample container from orbit, encapsulate it in a return vehicle, and shoot it \nback to Earth. NASA would also launch a second sample-return lander in \n2005, with the French orbiter to return that sample as well. This approach \nwould keep the Surveyor program\u2019s funding profile manageable.\nThe sample-return lander was to be a derivative of the Lockheed Martin\u2013\nbuilt Mars Polar Lander, which was under development at the time. The bud-\nget for the new lander was $130 million, slightly more than the total Climate \nOrbiter/Polar Lander spacecraft budget of $120 million. Within budget, the \nnew lander had to be \u201cgigantized,\u201d scaled up from the Polar Lander\u2019s 290 kilo-\ngrams to slightly more than 1,000 kilograms; sample collection and transfer \nsystems for rover, lander, and orbiter had to be developed; the sample-return \nrocket and Earth return vehicle had to be developed; and the rover had to be \ndeveloped.29 The new rover was to be a derivative of the Athena rover design \nchosen for the 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, which itself was an enlarged \nversion of the Mars Polar Lander. The new rover also had to meet a more \nstringent set of planetary protection requirements than those that had been \nimposed on the Polar Lander, and techniques to meet these requirements \nhad to be developed. Not only did the rover design have to protect Mars from \ncontamination by Earth, it also had to ensure that the sample would neither \ncontaminate Earth nor be contaminated by Earth when sent back. This capa-\nbility had to be designed into the sample collection and transfer system.\nAll these new developments were technologically risky, and in aerospace \nengineering, technical risk and cost risk amount to the same thing.

Since that \ntime, Sea Launch has lifted more than 40 satellites into orbit. This system has \nbeen touted as a major success story in international commercial cooperation \nfor space access.\nDespite some other successes, only Orbital Sciences became viable over the \nlong term. With the failure of the Iridium Corporation in spring 2000, a satel-\nlite communications system that many believed would be in the vanguard of \nbusiness for a rapidly expanding commercial space launch market, investment \nfor space enterprises became even scarcer. In some measure because of this, \nalthough they had previously eschewed government investment and the cor-\nresponding red tape, many of these start-ups began seeking capital from NASA \nand the military to support their efforts.

It had an ambitious timetable to fly by \n2001.

Among \nthe technologies it would demonstrate were reusable composite cryogenic tanks, \ngraphite composite primary structures, metallic thermal protection materi-\nals, reusable propulsion systems, autonomous flight control, and electronics \nand\u00a0avionics. \nGiven the problems experienced on the X-33 program, with delays of more \nthan a year because of difficulties with critical technical elements such as com-\nposite fuel tanks, NASA terminated the program in 2001.

Wright, the interdisciplinary committee was com-\nposed of astronomers, physicists, and geologists and was aimed at definitively \nsettling the question of the origin of lunar craters.

In such cases, it \nis believed that the assumption of a small increase in specific fuel consumptions at \nreduced total power output is a reasonable one for typical cases.\nThe net result is that for designs having very high installed engine power, max-\nimum range capability is reduced by the necessity of operating, for economical \ncruise, at greatly reduced total power output where some penalty in specific fuel \nconsumption must be paid at fixed altitude.\nFIXED-WING AND TILT-WING CONVERTIPLANE \nCHARACTERISTICS\na. Wing Download in Hovering Flight\nOther factors being equal, there is little question that it would be more desir-\nable to use a wing fixed to the fuselage structure rather than one designed to tilt \nthrough 90\u00b0 for convertiplanes. The reason for use of the tilting wing is to avoid the \nloss in lift that occurs when large wing areas are exposed to the downwash from the \nlifting propellers in hovering and low-speed flight. Such downloads also exist for \nhelicopter airframe components which are immersed in the rotor downwash. Here \nthey can be tolerated because of their small magnitudes, of the order of 2 to 3 per \ncent of total lift for typical helicopter configurations.\nNACA tests and analysis of download on flat panels in the slipstream of a \nrotor are reported in Reference 2. Results of recent tests made by Bell Helicopter \nCorporation on a model of a fixed-wing convertiplane are in good agreement with \nNACA data. The Bell tests included determination of the effects of deflecting 22[-] \nand 44-per cent-chord full-span plain flaps. Results are shown in Fig. 12 [not repro-\nduced]. For a wing whose projected area below the rotor-propeller occupied 10% of \nthe disc area, the download in hovering was 7.7% of rotor thrust at a disc loading of \n3 lbs/sq ft. There was a slight tendency for this percentage to decrease with increas-\ning disc loading. Flap deflection may be seen to provide appreciable reductions in \nthe download, to 5.5% and 3.4% for the two flaps tested at the optimum deflec-\ntion of 60\u00b0. Beyond 60\u00b0 deflection, the flow past the flap became erratic due to \npresumed separation, which may have been associated with the scale of the model.\nThe use of full span flaps, probably combined with the aileron function, thus \nappears desirable for future fixed-wing convertiplane designs, especially since such \nflaps would offer other advantages in addition to the reduction in hovering down-\nload. Based on the test results, so long as the fixed surfaces in the slipstream occupy \na reasonably small percentage of the disc area, the download penalty associated \nwith a fixed wing does not appear excessive.

When the RFP for the V-22 was issued, only the Bell-Boeing \nteam responded. While this presented a dilemma for advocates of competitive pro-\ncurements, the qualifications of the team, coupled with strong political advocacy \nfrom the powerful Texas and Pennsylvania congressional representatives, provided \nthe support needed to proceed.

He opened the resulting study with a sur-\nvey of key aspects of crater appearance and distribution, including a descrip-\ntion of their varying abundance by size, uneven distribution between the \nrough highlands and smoother maria, and overlapping relationships. He also \nnoted the differences in morphology between small craters and large ones, and \ndescribed qualitatively the scaling of depth with diameter in each of the two \nsize classes.36 These observations provided evidence for or against the volcanic \nand meteoric hypotheses for crater origins.\nWhereas his Arizona study had led Gilbert to consider a volcanic origin for \nMeteor Crater, this analysis convinced him of the opposite for the craters on \nthe Moon. To begin with, he noted that the sizes of lunar craters vastly over-\nshadow those of terrestrial volcanoes, and the enormous range of crater sizes \nis entirely unlike the distribution of Earth\u2019s features. An even bigger problem, \nGilbert argued, was the vast disparity in form. The most common type of ter-\nrestrial volcano, the stratovolcano (e.g., Mount Vesuvius), with its tall sloping \nsides, relatively shallow caldera, and misshapen or altogether absent central \ncones, looks very different from the typical crater described at the beginning \nof his paper. \u201cThus,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthrough the expression of every feature \nthe lunar crater emphatically denies kinship with the ordinary volcanoes of \nthe earth.\u201d37\nTurning to the meteoric hypothesis, Gilbert cited Richard A. Proctor\u2019s The \nMoon (1873) as the oldest developed theory he could find, also mentioning an \n1882 article by A.

Although it failed to reach Earth orbit due to a malfunction, it paved the way for future Pioneer missions.\n\n2.

Pioneer 10 was launched on March 2, 1972, and became the first spacecraft to achieve escape velocity from the Solar System. Pioneer 11, launched on April 5, 1973, was the first to encounter Saturn and study its rings and moons.\n\n3.

They are still heading into interstellar space.18 Other missions flew \nto Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter. All of these mission successes suggested that \nthe future for space science was bright.\nUnfortunately, Space Shuttle development was absorbing more resources \nthan expected because the Shuttle Main Engine and the heat shield tiles for \nthe Shuttle were proving difficult to develop. These cost overruns were dev-\nastating because it was clear, given the economics of the day\u2014hyperinflation \nand economic slowdown\u2014that additional funding was not to be had. NASA \nleadership pursued several angles in order to overcome the funding shortfall. \nAfter some lobbying, President Jimmy Carter was persuaded to establish as \nnational policy that all U.S. government payloads would fly on the Space \nShuttle.19 This decision was seen as securing the Shuttle\u2019s future by keeping \nthe flight volume up, allowing greater efficiency. Fixed costs would be amor-\ntized over more flights. In addition, the Shuttle would also carry domestic \ncommercial payloads. The only challenger to the Shuttle\u2019s monopoly was the \nEuropean Ariane expendable launch vehicles. Arianes had limited payload \ncapacity. At the same time, modern communication satellites were grow-\ning in size, requiring larger boosters to get to orbit. The impact of Carter\u2019s \ndecision was that all space science payloads would have to be compatible \nwith human missions to and in orbit. This decision magnified the cost of sci-\nence missions, a cost seen as unnecessary by the space science community. \nMeanwhile, the U.S. Air Force bitterly resisted any attempt to totally end its \nexpendable launch vehicle (ELV) program. The Air Force wanted to main-\ntain control over its access to space, and there was the fear of a single-point \nfailure if the Shuttle fleet was grounded for any reason.\nWith the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan came to office \nwith a mandate to reduce nondefense federal spending.

Along the way, a number of difficulties were discovered that \nrequired solutions.

Spacewatch has made significant contributions to this effort by discovering and tracking numerous NEOs since its inception in the late 1980s.\n\nSpacewatch is located at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and uses a 0.9-meter telescope and a 1.8-meter telescope to search for NEOs. The observatory has discovered over 1,500 asteroids and comets, including the asteroid 1997 XF11, which was initially thought to have a small chance of impacting Earth. Spacewatch was also instrumental in confirming the impact of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet with Jupiter in 1994.\n\nThe Spacewatch team has developed innovative techniques for detecting and tracking NEOs, including the use of automated discovery algorithms and drift scanning techniques. The observatory has also played a role in the Spaceguard Survey report, which outlines the goals and achievements of the Spaceguard survey network.\n\nIn summary, Spacewatch is a key component of the Spaceguard survey network and has made significant contributions to the discovery and tracking of NEOs.

In the first case, detonation of a radiatively effi-\ncient nuclear explosive near the object (a \u201cstand-off explosion\u201d) would spray \nthe surface with high-energy neutrons, irradiating an outer shell on one side \nof the asteroid. This layer\u2014which Ahrens and Harris estimated to be about \n20\u00a0centimeters in depth\u2014would then be removed as material is imparted \nwith velocity in excess of the escape velocity. This blow-off would in turn \nimpart an impulse to the remainder of the asteroid in the opposite direction, \nslightly changing its course. With a lead time of about a decade, the deflection \nvelocity required to divert an asteroid was found to be about 1 centimeter per \nsecond. To achieve this value for a 100-meter impactor, this approach would \ncall for the detonation of an approximately 0.01- to 0.1-kiloton nuclear explo-\nsive. For an asteroid 10 times larger, this energy would increase by 1,000 to \napproximately 0.01 to 0.1 megatons. Likewise, a 10-kilometer object would \nrequire an approximately 10- to 100-megaton explosion.

It has not yet been found feasible to house all \nof the equipment of an airship within the streamlined hull, although there pre-\nvails a decided tendency to eliminate more and more of the outside appendages \nand protuberances.

In \nall of this, allowance must of course be made for any local excess or deficiency of \nairspeed due to the potential flow or the boundary layer about the ship.\nOccasionally, relatively small protuberances, especially on the forebody on a \nmodel tested at [a] low Reynolds number, have shown an apparent influence by way \nof an increase of drag far beyond any normal expectation based on the drag of the \nprotuberance itself.

Another concept can be derived from the circulation, which is convenient \nfor many considerations, viz, that of rotation. The component of the rotation with \nreference to any axis is obtained if the circulation is taken around an elementary \nsurface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Expressed more exactly, \nsuch a rotation component is the ratio of the circulation around the edge of any \nsuch infinitesimal surface to the area of the surface. The total rotation is a vector \nand is obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular \naxes. In the case that the fluid rotates like a rigid body, the rotation thus defined \ncomes out as twice the angular velocity of the rigid body. If we take a rectangular \nsystem of axes and consider the rotations with reference to the separate axes, we \nfind that the rotation can also be expressed as the geometrical sum of the angular \nvelocities with reference to the three axes.\nThe statement that in the case of a potential motion the circulation is zero for \nevery closed fluid line can now be expressed by saying the rotation in it is always \nzero. The theorem that the circulation, if it is zero, remains zero under the conditions \nmentioned, can also now be expressed by saying that, if these conditions are satis-\nfied in a fluid in which there is no rotation, rotation can never arise.

In the case of a potential motion, the circulation is zero for every closed fluid line, and therefore, the rotation is always zero. This means that an irrotational fluid motion always remains irrotational. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the fluid is divided by the presence of bodies in it, and the divided flow reunites.\n\nThe concept of rotation is significant in fluid motion as it can help predict the behavior of fluid particles in different flow regimes. For example, in figure 3, the successive positions of a fluid line in flow around a solid body show how the rotation of fluid particles changes as they move around the body. The rotation of fluid particles can also affect the stability of fluid motion, as in the case of vortex shedding behind bluff bodies.\n\nIn summary, rotation is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that measures the angular motion of fluid particles around a given axis.

The tests involved a Bell flight \ncrew in the XV-15, and a NASA flight crew in the YO-3A.\nCOMPOSITE PROPROTOR BLADES\nFrom the very beginning of the TRRA project the proprotor blades were of \nspecial concern to the Government Project Office. The metal blades used on the \nXV-15 were designed in the late 1960s under Bell\u2019s IR&D funding for the predeces-\nsor tilt rotor aircraft, the Bell Model 300. This aircraft had a design gross weight \nof 12,400 pounds, 600 pounds lighter than that of the XV-15. The concern was \nthat the proprotors would be too highly loaded, i.e. operating too close to aero-\ndynamic stall, to provide adequate reserve thrust for control when operating in \nhover at high gross weights. This could result in a reduction of control effectiveness \nor the need for a substantial increase in power when operating at the high gross \nweight condition.\nFlight tests of the XV-15, however, did not indicate deficiencies. The metal \nbladed proprotor, although sized for a smaller aircraft, performed well at all XV-\n15 operating weights and flight conditions. While performance was satisfactory, \nanother problem emerged that could threaten the future of the XV-15. This was the \npossibility that one or more blades could become unserviceable or unflightworthy \ndue to mishandling or deterioration of the blade\u2019s structural integrity.\nConcern centered on the aft blade section, an aerodynamic fairing constructed \nof a lightweight aluminum honeycomb core covered with a thin steel skin (figure 61) \n[not reproduced].

In the helicopter, all stick forces must therefore arise \nfrom pitching moments on the blades themselves. When airfoil sections are chosen \nand mounted so as to have no pitching moments at any pitch angle, then there \nshould be no stick forces for the pilot to overcome.\nActually, pitching moments exist on rotor blades because of several second-\nary effects such as airfoil imperfections, blade-bending distortions, chordwise mass \nbalance, etc. Stick forces are caused from these secondary effects rather than from \nstraightforward moments as in the airplane.\nControl forces consist of both oscillating forces and steady forces. Oscillating \nforces may occur at frequencies of 1/rev. and even multiples of the number of \nblades. Oscillating forces with a frequency of 1/rev. are entirely chargeable to dif-\nferences in pitching moments between the rotor blades. For example, if only one \nblade of a three-bladed rotor experiences a pitching moment, this one blade exerts \na steady force on the swash plate as it rotates. This rotating force is transmitted to \nthe control stick. Because the pilot\u2019s hand is not a rigid support, the control stick \nyields under the rotating force and describes a small circle. Helicopters are often \ncharacterized by a small 1/rev. stick shake.\nHigher frequency oscillations in the control stick can arise at integral multiples \nof the number of rotor blades. A three-bladed rotor may, therefore, experience a \n3/rev., 6/rev., 9/rev., etc., oscillation in the controls. These higher frequency oscil-\nlations arise from periodic changes in the pitching moment of each blade. The \nperiodic changes, in turn, arise from periodic air force changes in a rotor in forward \nflight or from periodic blade deflections. For example, a three-bladed rotor with \nequal pitching moments on all three blades will produce a 3/rev. motion of the \ncontrol stick in forward flight because of the change in velocity on the advancing \nand retreating blades. As the blade comes forward and experiences higher velocities, \nits pitching moment is increased, and since this happens three times for each rotor \nrevolution, a 3/rev. shake of the control stick results.\nOscillating forces in the control system can be prevented from annoying the \npilot by the use of irreversible controls or by making the effective mass of the pilot\u2019s \nstick large enough to absorb the oscillating force. One convenient means of accom-\nplishing the latter is by the use of an inertia damper which may consist of a weight \non a high-pitch screw, the weight being forced to rotate when axial force is applied \nto the screw. The inertia damper is simply a means of producing a large, effective \nmass without heavy weights.\nSteady forces on the control stick come entirely from 1/rev. variations in blade-\npitching moments. These again may arise from periodic air forces, periodic blade \ndeflections, or both.\nSometimes tabs are used on blades intentionally to produce pitching moments. \nIn forward flight these pitching moments then vary periodically as the velocity over \nthe blade varies, becoming large on the advancing blade and small on the retreating \nblade. A steady stick force results."], "reference_answer": "\n\nStick forces in helicopters are the forces that the pilot feels on the control stick, which is used to control the pitch of the rotor blades and, therefore, the helicopter's altitude and direction.

When airfoil sections are chosen and mounted so as to have no pitching moments at any pitch angle, there should be no stick forces for the pilot to overcome. However, in reality, these secondary effects do exist and cause stick forces.\n\nOscillating forces in the control stick can occur at frequencies of 1/rev. and multiples of the number of blades.

For example, if only one blade of a three-bladed rotor experiences a pitching moment, this one blade exerts a steady force on the swash plate as it rotates, which is transmitted to the control stick. The pilot's hand is not a rigid support, so the control stick yields under the rotating force and describes a small circle, causing a small 1/rev. stick shake.\n\nHigher frequency oscillations in the control stick can arise at integral multiples of the number of rotor blades. These oscillations arise from periodic changes in the pitching moment of each blade, which are caused by periodic air force changes in a rotor in forward flight or from periodic blade deflections. For example, a three-bladed rotor with equal pitching moments on all three blades will produce a 3/rev. motion of the control stick in forward flight because of the change in velocity on the advancing and retreating blades.\n\nOscillating forces in the control system can be prevented from annoying the pilot by the use of irreversible controls or by making the effective mass of the pilot's stick large enough to absorb the oscillating force. One convenient means of accomplishing the latter is by the use of an inertia damper, which may consist of a weight on a high-pitch screw, the weight being forced to rotate when axial force is applied to the screw. The inertia damper is simply a means of producing a large, effective mass without heavy weights.\n\nSteady forces on the control stick come entirely from 1/rev. variations in blade-pitching moments, which may arise from periodic air forces, periodic blade deflections, or both. Sometimes tabs are used on blades intentionally to produce pitching moments, which vary periodically as the velocity over the blade varies, becoming large on the advancing blade and small on the retreating blade. A steady stick force results.", "reference_answer_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}}, {"query": "What were the primary scientific goals of the Cassini-Huygens mission, and what were the key scientific instruments carried by the Cassini orbiter and the Huygens probe, including the power source and gravity assists used during its journey to Saturn and its moon Titan?", "query_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}, "reference_contexts": ["198\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958\u20132016\nScientific Instruments:\nCassini:\n 1. cosmic dust analyzer (CDA)\n 2. visible and infrared mapping spectrometer \n(VIMS)\n 3. imaging science system (ISS)\n 4. radar\n 5. ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS)\n 6. radio and plasma wave spectrometer \n(RPWS)\n 7. plasma spectrometer (CAPS)\n 8. ultraviolet imaging spectrograph (UVIS)\n 9. magnetospheric imaging instrument (MIMI)\n 10. dual technique magnetometer (MAG)\n 11. composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS)\n 12. radio science subsystem (RSS)\nHuygens:\n 1. atmospheric structure instrument (HASI)\n 2. gas chromatograph neutral mass spectrom-\neter (GC/MS)\n 3. aerosol collector and pyrolyzer (ACP)\n 4. descent imager/spectral radiometer (DISR)\n 5. surface science package (SSP)\n 6.

The airfoil section is established with due regard to the usual factors. This \nfixes the lift coefficient at all angles of attack. The limit on the landing speed and \nthe maximum speed compromise in fixing the wing loading. Consequently, the \nstalling speed is more or less a quantity that is not influenced by the take-off con-\nsiderations. It should be noted, however, that the designer has it within his power \nto change the wing in order to change the take-off, if he so requires and, also, that \nslots, flaps, and similar devices are equally effective in affecting the seaplane perfor-\nmance as they are in altering the performance of a landplane in this respect.\nIn practice, a seaplane may or may not be stalled off the water in take-off. The \ndesigner plans on a velocity higher than the minimum in the take-off, because the \nmaximum lift coefficient is at a high angle of attack. As the seaplane accelerates \nduring the take-off run, the wing is at an angle of attack corresponding to a low \nfloat resistance and a low seaplane drag. Although the angle between the wing and \nthe float can be altered by the designer, the angle is a compromise as finally estab-\nlished. Near the end of the take-off, the wing can be pulled up so as to stall off the \nwater at minimum speed, but the afterbody of the float must not touch the water \nin doing so, and care must be exercised that the seaplane does not fall back into the \nwater owing to the low flying speed. In a sea, it may be necessary to stall off the top \nof a wave. Otherwise, it is customary to consider the minimum speed at take-off \nat an angle of attack lower than that of maximum lift coefficient. Some reserve lift \nthen exists after the float has left the water.\nThe rate of acceleration of the craft during the take-off run depends on the \namount that the propeller thrust exceeds the combined water and air resistance and \non the mass accelerated. The propeller characteristics are established from factors \nother than take-off, excepting when take-off is critical. For fixed-blade propellers, \ngood climb and high speed are likely to be more important than the take-off. But \nin case the hump resistance of the float is so great that excess thrust is not avail-\nable with a certain propeller set to a definite pitch, a change in propeller design, \na change in propeller efficiency, or a change in pitch setting may give the desired \nresults. The propeller diameter is limited by the position of the power plant with \nrespect to the other parts of the airplane and with respect to the water. The pitch \nsetting of the propeller blades can be adjusted to give some change in static thrust \nwithout affecting the other characteristic too much, and this means is resorted to \nusually in case of difficulties. A large pitch gives a large static thrust. Controllable \npitch propellers with pitch settings varying 8 to 10\u00b0 permit the variations between \nthe static thrust and the cruising-speed thrust desired.\nThe propeller design, diameter, and pitch setting having been determined, it \nis necessary that the propeller thrust be calculated for the speeds concerned in the \ntake-off. It is assumed that the static thrust exists up to 20 or 30 miles per hour, \nand in this range it is constant. Diehl gives the following empirical equation for \nstatic thrust:"], "reference_answer": "\nThe designer ensures that the seaplane does not fall back into the water during take-off by carefully controlling the angle of attack of the wing and the afterbody of the float.

Some of the objections to \nplywood-covered blades are that they require careful handwork, do not \nlend themselves to quantity production, and are not weatherproof.\n3. All-wood blades are used frequently. They are usually built up from lamina-\ntions of several woods, heavier woods being used in the forward portion \nand light woods such as balsa being used in the rearward portion. All-wood \nblades are relatively simple to fabricate, especially if built with rectangu-\nlar plan form and constant thickness.

One disadvantage of the all-\nwood blade is that it is relatively heavy and, along with fabric and plywood \nblades, is subject to moisture and deterioration.\n4. Metal blades are being developed at the present time by most manufactur-\ners. Blades are either built up from pieces of sheet stock or utilize extru-\nsions together with sheet metal. Probably the simplest blade yet fabricated \ninvolves an extruded D-spar which forms the leading edge and a V-shaped \nsheet metal trailing edge joined to the D-spar by flush rivets.

V/STOL aircraft can be classified in \nthree categories: those that use rotors for both lift and propulsion in cruise (the pure \nhelicopters), those that operate as conventional aircraft using wing lift and separate \npropulsion in cruise, and combination configurations (the compound or unloaded \nhelicopter). Requiring the helicopter rotor to provide both lift and propulsion in \ncruising flight results in problems of retreating blade stall and advancing blade \ncompressibility effects which increase the rotor profile power requirements of the \nhelicopter and limit its cruising speed.\nIn the compound configuration the propulsion job is taken over by separate \npropellers or ducted fans and part of the lift is transferred to a wing; thus the rotor \nis unloaded and the speed capability is increased. The parasite drag of the rotor and \npylon remains, however, with the result that the power required remains above that \nof more conventional aircraft.\nThe other V/STOL aircraft cruise on wing lift, and for these the same rules \nfor obtaining good cruise performance that have always applied to conventional \naircraft still apply, namely, aerodynamic cleanliness to reduce parasite drag and \npower and a wing designed for the desired cruising altitude and speed to minimize \nthe induced power.\nGood aerodynamic design is important not only at the highest speeds but \nthroughout the speed range because most aircraft cruise in the speed range near the \nmaximum lift-drag ratio where the span is important. A large wing span is needed \nto minimize induced drag and therefore power, as can be deduced from the expres-\nsion of figure 1. A clean aerodynamic design is needed to minimize power through-\nout the speed range. A good case in point is the helicopter where the high parasite \ndrag of current configurations is largely responsible for the difference in power \nbetween the helicopter and the airplane as shown in figure 4 near the speed for \nhelicopter minimum power. This point is discussed more completely in reference 3.\nThe power required for the V/STOL aircraft in cruise is a little greater than \nthat for the conventional airplane because of the reduction in propulsive efficiency \nwhich results from the fact that the propulsion units must also be designed to pro-\nvide the lift in hovering for most V/STOL configurations; thus, a compromise in \nthe design must be made.\nPROPULSIVE EFFICIENCY COMPROMISE\nEach V/STOL type has a different propulsion-hovering design compromise. \nAn example of one such design compromise for the propeller-driven V/STOL air-\ncraft is shown in figure 5. For best static thrust a relatively large amount of camber, \nas indicated by the design section lift coefficient, is required. With a lot of camber,"], "reference_answer": "\n1.

They have lower power requirements compared to pure helicopters in cruising flight.\n3. Compound or unloaded helicopter: These aircraft use separate propellers or ducted fans for propulsion and transfer part of the lift to a wing, unloading the rotor. While this increases their speed capability, the parasite drag of the rotor and pylon remains, resulting in higher power requirements compared to more conventional aircraft.\n\nThe power required for cruising flight is highest for pure helicopters due to the increased rotor profile power requirements.

It can be seen that the conventional \nhelicopter, which was the only practicable aircraft capable of hovering when power \nplants were relatively heavy and bulky, remains the most desirable configuration \nwhen hovering is a major part of the mission. Because of considerations of rotor-\nblade stall, rotor-hub drag, and rotor instabilities, helicopters are not well suited to \nachievement of high speeds or large ranges. However, the power required in cruising \ncan be greatly reduced by careful attention to drag reduction as compared with the \npower required when drag has been given little or no consideration. This decrease \nin drag will make possible both the achievement of a reasonably large ferry range \nfor the helicopter and a substantial increase in its productivity in normal missions.\nThe speed limitation imposed by rotor-blade stall can be alleviated by transfer-\nring the propulsion function from the rotor to propellers and using a fixed wing to \ncarry a large percentage of the weight in high-speed flight. The drag of the rotor and \ntendencies toward rotor instabilities remain serious problems and have caused many \nengineers to look for more suitable configurations where high speed and long range \nare the primary considerations and hovering is necessary only for the short time \nperiods required to permit vertical take-offs and landings. Years of research, design, \ndevelopment, and experience have resulted in the conventional high-aspect-ratio, \npropeller-driven, subsonic airplane configuration as the one most suitable where \nrange, efficiency, and operational flexibility [are] necessary and speeds greater than \n400 knots are not required. It has been natural therefore to attempt to add to this \nconfiguration the capability of vertical take-off and landing.\nFigure 3 [not reproduced] shows a family of V/STOL aircraft which represent \nvarious approaches to this general solution. In this figure are four wing-propulsion \nsystems which have been proposed. It has been assumed that a given load is to be \ncarried in a given cargo-type fuselage. This fuselage requires substantially the same \nstabilizing and control means regardless of the wing-propulsion system and will \nobviously require the same lifting and thrust forces for its sustentation and propul-\nsion. With the exception of the tilt-rotor aircraft, the aircraft shown have roughly \nthe same effective span in cruising flight and the same downwash velocity when \nhovering if the same gross weight is assumed. The tilt-rotor configuration has a \nlower effective span and a lower hovering downwash velocity."], "reference_answer": "\n1. Tilt-rotor aircraft: This configuration has a lower effective span and a lower hovering downwash velocity compared to the other aircraft shown in Figure 3. The tilt-rotor design allows for vertical take-off and landing while maintaining a high-aspect-ratio wing for efficient cruising flight. However, the complexity of the tilt-rotor mechanism and the need for a more complex control system can be seen as disadvantages.\n2. Tilt-wing aircraft: This configuration features wings that can rotate around a central axis, allowing for vertical take-off and landing while maintaining a high-aspect-ratio wing for efficient cruising flight. The tilt-wing design provides good load-carrying capability and efficient cruising flight, but the complexity of the tilting mechanism and the need for a more complex control system can be seen as disadvantages.\n3. Tail-sitter aircraft: This configuration features a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability with a high-aspect-ratio wing for efficient cruising flight. The tail-sitter design provides good load-carrying capability and efficient cruising flight, but the need for a complex tail-first landing and take-off procedure can be seen as a disadvantage.\n4. Lift-plus-cruise aircraft: This configuration features separate lift and cruise systems, typically with a large number of small lift engines and a smaller number of high-thrust cruise engines. The lift-plus-cruise design provides good load-carrying capability and efficient cruising flight, but the complexity and weight of the multiple lift engines can be seen as disadvantages.\n\nIt is important to note that the figure and the specific details of the aircraft are not provided in the text, so the answer is based on general knowledge of the different wing-propulsion systems.", "reference_answer_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}}, {"query": "Question: What was the role of the star tracker component in the Deep Impact mission and why did it cause concern for the team?", "query_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}, "reference_contexts": ["Chapter 4: Applying Lessons Learned\n159\nimpactor might cause quite a spectacular event.

This proved a pipe dream as well, and NASA \neventually abandoned it.\nWhy did this effort fail? Deploying an inflatable structure from the capsule \nand gliding it to a landing on the surface is a task not without difficulties. The \nproject leaders were never able to overcome the technical challenges. If it was \nnot the deployment, it was the control mechanism. If neither of those, it was \nthe difficulty of piloting it. If none of those, it was the size and weight of the \nparaglider in relation to the capacity of the Gemini capsule. \nThe first astronaut flight of Gemini took place on 23 March 1965, when \nMercury veteran Gus Grissom and John W. Young, a naval aviator chosen as \nan astronaut in 1962, flew Gemini III. The next mission, flown in June 1965, \nstayed aloft for four days, and astronaut Edward H. White II performed the \nfirst American extravehicular activity (EVA), or spacewalk. Eight more mis-\nsions followed through November 1966. \nVirtually all of those missions had unique problems. The flight of \nGemini\u00a0 VIII, in the spring of 1966, proved difficult as astronauts Neil \nArmstrong and David Scott sought to rendezvous and dock with an Agena tar-\nget vehicle. The crew docked with it as planned, but the joined spacecraft began \na roll. Armstrong used Gemini\u2019s orbital maneuvering system to stop the roll, \nbut the moment he stopped using the thrusters, it started again. They undocked \nwith the Agena, but Gemini VIII continued to roll at about one revolution \nper second. After a lengthy process of steadying the spacecraft, Armstrong and \nScott tested each thruster on the capsule and found that number 8 was stuck in \nthe on position, causing the roll. The mission then returned to Earth one orbit \nlater. Investigators determined that an electrical short had caused a static elec-\ntricity discharge and astronauts Armstrong and Scott had salvaged the mission \nthrough their actions. \nLikewise, while Ed White enjoyed his spacewalk, he had no duties outside \nthe spacecraft. Not so with the spacewalk of Gene Cernan during Gemini IX \non 5 June 1966. It was only the second time an American astronaut had ever \nventured outside of a capsule to expose the body to the extreme environment of \nspace, and it nearly proved fatal. Cernan quickly learned that anything he did \nin microgravity took more energy than anticipated and his body overheated. \nThis overtaxed his spacesuit\u2019s environmental system; his helmet visor fogged \nover, sweat poured into his eyes, and his heart raced to more than three times its \nnormal rate. Finally, after more than 2 hours and one and a half orbits of Earth, \na decimated Gene Cernan made it back inside the capsule after failing to com-\nplete most of the objectives of his EVA.

What may have the proper amount of com-\nplication for a foreign nation may be entirely too primitive for America. We may \nrequire more ease of operation and be entirely prepared to pay the price for it in way \nof more complication. German mentality is very different from American mental-\nity. Their social structure is different. Their system of education is very different. \nIt all brings about the result that Germans are better fitted and prepared to assume \nthe functions of machines, and Americans are better fitted and prepared to oper-\nate machines and to cope with their complications. An airship ideal for German \nrequirements may be too primitive for the needs of this country. The question of \ncomplication should be carefully weighed with this in mind, before new design \nprinciples for airships are condemned.\nI enter now into the discussion of specific problems of progressive airship \nresearch, which discussion, I hope, will demonstrate the abundance of such prob-\nlems, and the corresponding brightness of the prospect for airship improvement. I \nbegin with the problems most engineering-like in character, and gradually advance \ntowards more abstract science.\nI mention first the question of automatic control of airships. Surface ships and \nairplanes have been successfully and advantageously controlled automatically, and \nthis may also be desirable for airships. It may result in smaller airloads on the \nstructure and in larger security and comfort of travel. This large research project \nis still untouched in many respects, and recommends itself to the attention of the \nresearch engineer.\nThe broad idea is not new. There is a patent issued to Dr. Klemperer having \nreference to automatic control.

It is only relatively evil, and is the price to be paid for the gain. The fact that a new device is more complicated should not be enough to deter us from adopting it, as long as it can be shown that the greater complication is not out of proportion to the advantage gained. The passage also notes that larger complication does not necessarily make a device less reliable.\n\nThe passage highlights the importance of considering the appropriate level of complication for a particular context, taking into account factors such as the capabilities of the users and the price that they are willing to pay for ease of operation.

In the context of a windmill, the L/D ratio is used to describe the efficiency of the windmill as a lifting surface. The L/D ratio depends on the inclinations of the forces (R) acting on the blades to the perpendicular of the flight path.\n\nIf the axis of rotation of the windmill is only slightly inclined to the flight path, and the inclinations of R to the perpendicular to the flight path are alternately positive and negative, it is possible for the windmill to have a very high L/D ratio for the whole disk surface. This is because the positive and negative torques on the windmill balance out, resulting in a net torque of zero. The high L/D ratio could potentially be higher than that of a single blade element.\n\nThe peculiar feathering action of the Autogiro may assist in securing this high L/D ratio. Feathering refers to the adjustment of the pitch of the blades to control the lift and drag generated by the rotor. By adjusting the pitch of the blades, the Autogiro can maintain a high L/D ratio even in side winds, which can be particularly challenging for conventional windmills.\n\nTherefore, it would be dangerous to dismiss the surprising results obtained by La Cierva in the wind tunnel as entirely impossible, as they demonstrate the potential for windmills to achieve high L/D ratios under certain conditions.", "reference_answer_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}}, {"query": "Question: What is the current status of proposed Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs) and what is the major issue with NASA's Space Shuttle?", "query_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}, "reference_contexts": ["NASA and the Post\u2013Cold War Launch Vehicle Challenge\n27\nphase.

Mr. Pitcairn had learned with little trou-\nble to fly an Autogiro in England, and one of its first appearances in the American \nair was when he flew the visiting ship in December, 1928, over his home in Bryn \nAthyn, Pa. Later he piloted it from near Philadelphia to Langley Field, a distance of \nseveral hundred miles, the first cross-country flight by [an] Autogiro in America.\nWithin two years from its first flight in America, the Autogiro went through \nmany modifications in design, though some of these are only apparent to the tech-\nnical observer. Rapid progress was stimulated by the intention to enter on commer-\ncial production as soon as the remaining weakness or uncertainties were eliminated \nfrom the machine. No effort was spared to this end, but on the other hand the \nAutogiro Company of America would not permit any premature introduction of \nthe craft of into the commercial market. The work was carried on quietly, in spite of \na great deal of public and technical curiosity. Only when we were satisfied on both \nsides of the Atlantic that the Autogiro was no longer experimental but a useful, \nefficient and reliable flying machine were the results of these long years of research \noffered to the public.\nAn important American development was the mechanical starter to set the rotor \nin motion before taking off. The machine cannot fly until the rotor is turning at \nleast 80 revolutions per minute, so it has always been necessary to provide means for \ngetting up rotational speed before attempting flight. In the experimental days this \nwas usually done by starting the rotor with a push by hand and increasing its speed"], "reference_answer": "\nThe second visit of the author to the United States in 1930 was to demonstrate the rapid progress made in the design and development of the Autogiro, and to showcase the results of the long years of research to the public. This was evident by the fact that he was greeted by four Autogiros flying in formation as he entered New York harbor. The purpose of this visit was to show that the Autogiro was no longer experimental but a useful, efficient and reliable flying machine.", "reference_answer_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}}, {"query": "What was the impact of the cancellation of the CRAF mission on the Cassini project and its budget?", "query_by": {"model_name": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "type": "ai"}, "reference_contexts": ["50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n236\nNo less irritation was expressed by the European space science commu-\nnity.

In autumn 1989, Congress had approved the CRAF/Cassini program \nwithin a budget limit of $1.6 billion, but the cost of Cassini alone was now \nestimated at about $1.7 billion, and implementation of the whole program \nwas definitely jeopardized. NASA canceled the CRAF mission and under-\ntook a dramatic reconfiguration of the Cassini project in order to reduce \nits\u00a0cost. \nA new budgetary crisis arose in 1994, when Congress threatened to dra-\nmatically reduce the NASA budget. If approved, this reduction could lead \nto either Cassini or the important x-ray astronomy mission Advanced X-ray \nAstrophysics Facility (AXAF) (eventually called Chandra) being canceled. \nProspects for Cassini were not encouraging, as the mission did not enjoy \nsupport from NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin. Cassini was the perfect \nantithesis of Goldin\u2019s \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d policy (see chapter 5): a mam-\nmoth mission, conceived 10 years earlier, which would not provide scientific \nresults until more than 10 years later. Its cost was to be measured in billions \nof dollars, and a failure at launch or beyond would have been devastating. \nMoreover, its management suffered from the complexity of a large interna-\ntional cooperative endeavor and an 18-instrument payload coming from \ncountless scientific institutions on two continents. Goldin did not hide his \nviews on Cassini, and he was prepared to cancel it, or at least to submit it to \na drastic revision to reduce its cost.20 \nReporting to ESA\u2019s Bonnet on a meeting of NASA\u2019s Space Science and \nApplications Advisory Committee, SSAC Chairman Lodewijk Woltjer wrote \n18.

John W. \u201cGus\u201d Crowley took the lead. An MIT graduate, \nCrowley would become chief of the Langley Flight Test Section and a future \nNACA Associate Director for Research. He organized a flight research program \nto support an Army Air Service request for technical information on various \naircraft wing loading, center of gravity, pressure distribution at various angles \nof attack, physiological effects on pilots during maneuvers, and a host of other \nquestions. Throughout the latter half of the 1920s, flight research at Langley \nproceeded using a variety of aircraft types. They concentrated on pressure dis-\ntribution over airframes in the earliest projects, analyzing through repetition \nand variation what happened to the aircraft during level flight, pull-ups, rolls, \nspins, inverted flight, dives, and pulling out of dives. In late 1928, engineers \nreported that \u201cnormal force coefficients obtained in maneuvers, pull-ups for \nexample, are much larger than obtained from tests in steady flight or from \nwind tunnel tests.\u201d This led to an expansion of research to catalog these flight \ncharacteristics under different conditions. \nThe NACA gained fame with this work, publishing in 1929 the first seminal \nstudies of aerodynamics of pressure distribution on aircraft, followed early the \nnext year with a summary, \u201cThe Pressure Distribution Over the Wings and Tail \nSurfaces of a PW-9 Pursuit Airplane in Flight.\u201d This report set a new standard \nof knowledge; NACA writers announced:\nIt is perhaps needless to say that crashes resulting from structural failures in the air, \neven though relatively rare, have a particularly bad effect on the morale of flying \npersonnel\u2026and on the attitude of the public toward aviation, and must be eventu-\nally eliminated if confidence in the airplane is to become deep-rooted. It is manifest, \ntherefore, that the structural design of airplanes must be put on an indisputably \nsound basis. This means that design rules must be based more on known phenom-\nena, whether discovered analytically or experimentally, and less on conjecture.5\nBy the early 1930s, the NACA\u2019s flight research program had established a \nreputation for excellence just as great as that of the wind tunnel work. The \nhistorian Michael H. Gorn has concluded: \u201cFirst of all, its success did as much \nas any NACA activity to bring acclaim and reputation to this new institution. \nHenceforth, the military services, the universities, and the aircraft industries \nlooked to the NACA for research leadership and innovation\u2026.

While some of the evaluated components exceeded the \nefficiency goals, others did not. As a result, the engineers in Hartford estimated \nthat the overall reduction in specific fuel consumption in a flight engine would \nbe 15 percent, with direct operating costs at 5 percent. With the exception of \nNOx levels, the components failed to meet the EPA\u2019s emissions requirement.33\nCarl Ciepluch of Lewis, Donald Davis of GE, and David Gray of Pratt & \nWhitney proclaimed the E3 a success at the $200 million program\u2019s completion \nin 1985. They were confident that the technology developed during its course \nwas, and would continue to be, effectively employed in both current and future \nadvanced transport aircraft engine designs.34 Later estimates claimed that the \nperformance of the E3 demonstration engines exceeded the expectations of the \nprogram even more, with overall fuel use reduced 18 percent and operating \ncosts lowered between 5 and 10 percent.35\nThe experience and generated knowledge of the E3 led to the introduction of \nnew engines from GE and Pratt & Whitney.

The engines they \ndeveloped for the 777 were the largest and most powerful ever produced, \nwith ratings in the area of 100,000 pounds of thrust. Their fan sections were \napproximately 10 feet in diameter, with an overall size nearly as wide as the \nfuselage of a Boeing 737. Pratt & Whitney invested $500 million into the \nPW4084, which was less fuel-efficient but easier to maintain. Rolls-Royce \nspent approximately $1 billion on the Trent series. GE spent $1.5 billion to \ndevelop the GE90 family, which generated the most thrust. The comparable \nsize and performance of each placed more emphasis on the financial negotia-\ntions and airline partnerships. The payoff was huge. At $10 million or more \nper engine, potential sales of $60 billion over 20 years were possible.

Urey, who was later instrumental in fixing \nthe Moon as a primary target in space exploration\u2014marked a turning point \nin the acceptance of an impact origin for lunar craters.42\nIf the first decades of the 20th century were characterized by tentative inter-\ndisciplinary alliances, the 1950s and 1960s saw a dramatic turn toward insti-\ntutional backing of cratering research.

Readers will note that I \nhave used this convention for all missions until and \nincluding 1970 but after that switched to Latin \nnumbers (Mariner 9, Mariner 10, etc.). This divi-\nsion is somewhat arbitrary but was necessary not to \nconfuse readers.\nThe practice of giving spacecraft \u201cofficial\u201d \nnames is complicated by the fact that beginning \nwith the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and until the \nlate 1980s, the Soviet Union never announced or \nacknowledged a mission if it failed to reach Earth \norbit. In addition, for those lunar and planetary \nprobes that did reach Earth orbit but failed to leave \nit, the Soviets adopted two strategies:\n\u2022 between 1960 and 1963, the Soviets simply \nnever admitted their existence and made no \nannouncement; and\n\u2022 beginning November 1963, the Soviet media \nbegan to give these stranded-in-Earth-orbit \nspacecraft \u201cKosmos\u201d numbers. So, the deep \nspace vehicle launched on 11 November 1963 \nthat reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for \ndeep space was simply given the \u201cnext\u201d Kosmos \nnumber, in this case \u201c21.\u201d By giving it such a \nnondescript name (\u201cKosmos 21\u201d), Soviet offi-\ncials sought to draw attention away from such \nfailures. This practice was followed well into \nthe late 1980s.\nFor both of these three types of missions, I have \nused the following convention:\n[Program, Spacecraft design designation, serial \nnumber]\nOR\nKosmos number [Program]\nI do not use terms such as \u201cMarsnik 1\u201d or \u201cMars \n1960A\u201d (listed in the National Space Science \nData Center, for example, to denote the spacecraft \nlaunched on 10 October 1960). Since the Soviets \nnever used such names, it would be entirely inac-\ncurate to ascribe such designations. Such fictitious \nnames (such as \u201cSputnik 27\u201d) unfortunately prolif-\nerate online but are Western inventions.\nLaunch Sites\nFor Soviet and Russian launch sites, the following \nconventions apply:\n\u201cSite A / B\u201d implies that the probe was launched \nfrom Site A, Launch Unit B\nMission Goals\nThere are good reasons not to use terms such as \n\u201cflyby\u201d or \u201cflight\u201d since spacecraft do not fly. As \none of the reviewers for this manuscript pointed \nout, these terms are remnants of the era of aero-\nnautics.

However, because terms \nsuch as \u201cflyby\u201d and \u201cflight\u201d are still widely used by \nmany space agencies globally, this manuscript has \nretained their use, despite their imprecise nature."], "reference_answer": "\nThe Soviet Union assigned official names to their spacecraft using a specific convention.

In this figure, a curve is faired between the results for the \nairfoils for the existing, design goal, and realized maximum lift coefficient at a \nretreating blade condition. It indicates that the new sections provide a substantial \nincrease in the maximum lift capability over the 6-series sections. This was the first \npriority goal.\nThe second priority was to maintain the low-drag characteristics of the existing \n6-series airfoils at the cruise Mach number and local lift coefficient. Figure 12 gives \nthe drag of the existing section (which was the desired level) and the drag of the \nadvanced technology sections at this condition. In this case, the drag is lower for \nthe .25 and .75 r/R radial stations but is slightly higher than the 6-series sections at \nthe .5 and 1.0 r/R radial stations.\nThe drag divergence Mach number was the third priority goal. For this charac-\nteristic, the goal was to obtain a drag divergence Mach number for the airfoil that \nwas higher than the local blade value at a speed of 350 knots. Figure 13 shows the \ngoal, the existing airfoil results, and the new technology airfoil results. The new \ntechnology sections exceeded the desired results at all stations except the tip.\nMaximum lift-to-drag ratio at the hover condition was the final airfoil design \ngoal. Figure 14 shows the differences between the values obtained from the existing \nairfoils, the desired values, and the values obtained by using the advanced tech-\nnology sections. It can be seen that the new sections maintain maximum lift-to-\ndrag ratios of over 100 while the 6-series sections only provide maximum values in \nthe 80\u2019s.\nWhen the advanced technology airfoils are applied to the current blade con-\nfiguration, forward flight and hover helicopter performance predictions indicate \nthat the advanced technology airfoils increase the maximum thrust by 16 per-\ncent and increase the propeller efficiency by 5 percent beyond the current 6-series \nairfoil levels.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nAn intensive airfoil development study has been carried out for the XV-15 tilt-\nrotor vehicle. State-of-the-art design techniques were used to produce the new sec-\ntions, and a wind tunnel \u201cfly-off\u201d between the best airfoils was held.

At the time, it took 4 hours \nand 25 minutes for a signal to reach Earth from the \nspacecraft. The spacecraft began its approach \nphase towards Pluto on 15 January 2015, its trajec-\ntory adjusted with a 93-second thruster burn on \n10\u00a0March. Two days later, with about four months \nremaining before its close encounter, New Horizons \nfinally became closer to Pluto than Earth is to the \nSun. Pictures of Pluto began to reveal distinct fea-\ntures by 29 April, with detail growing literally week \nby week into its approach. A final 23-second engine \nburn on 29 June accelerated New Horizons towards \nits target by 27 centimeters/second, also fine-tun-\ning its trajectory. There was a minor concern on \n4\u00a0 July when New Horizons entered \u201csafe mode\u201d \ndue to a timing flaw in the spacecraft command \nsequence. Fortunately, the spacecraft returned to \nfully nominal science operations by 7\u00a0July. Three \ndays later, data from New Horizons was used to \nconclusively answer one of the most basic myster-\nies about the dwarf planet: its size. Mission scien-\ntists concluded that Pluto is 2,370 kilometers in \ndiameter, slightly larger than prior estimates. \nCharon was confirmed to be 1,208 kilometers in \ndiameter. Finally, at 11:49 UT on 14 July 2015, \nNew Horizons flew by about 7,800 kilometers \nabove the surface of Pluto. About 13 hours later, at \n00:53 UT on 15 July, a 15-minute series of status \nmessages was received at mission operations at \nJohns Hopkins University\u2019s APL (via NASA\u2019s Deep \nSpace Network) confirming that the flyby had \nbeen fully successful.

The basic technique, \nbouncing radio waves off various objects, had been used as early as the 1920s \nfor ionospheric research. It became famous during World War II for its mil-\nitary utility, and it was again used for scientific research at the war\u2019s end. \nIn September 1945, the U.S. Army Signal Corps\u2019 Evans laboratory in New \nJersey started trying to bounce radio waves off the Moon, though they were \nnot successful in detecting the returned signals until January 1946. Similar \nexperiments were conducted almost immediately in Britain and Hungary; \nwar surplus radars were also quickly turned to the study of meteors.44\nOne of the fundamental weaknesses of radar as a tool for solar system \nresearch is that the returned signal strength declines with the inverse fourth \npower of the distance.

Even the strictest \ninterpretation of requirements allowed Discovery missions to focus their investiga-\ntions on nearly any aspect of the origin or evolution of planetary bodies, as well as the \nsearch for exoplanets (in some Announcements of Opportunity). Selection was always \nbased on the presentation of high-quality science tempered with an acceptable level \nof risk within the constraints of cost and schedule. \nThe second half of Recommendation 2 urged the correspondence of science priorities \nand science payload, which was the mechanism for fellow scientists and instrument \nbuilders to determine whether the proposing team had chosen appropriate instru-\nmentation for the mission so that the major questions in the investigation could be \nanswered. (The remainder of the recommendation was satisfied by the tenets of the \nDiscovery Program: development time constraints and acceptable risk were always \ncriteria of selection.) \nReturning to the COMPLEX criteria, the question of whether the missions opti-\nmized science return for money spent was a hot debate in the early years of the first \ndecade of the twenty-first century in both Discovery and Explorer mission lines, par-\nticularly under the leadership of Paul Hertz, chief scientist in the Science Mission \nDirectorate and, later, head of the Astrophysics Division. Hertz and others determined \nthat Discovery missions were explicitly not looking at \u201cscience per dollar,\u201d but instead \nlooking to maximize science return within the Discovery cost cap. This was a subtle but \nimportant distinction that drove proposal strategy. If Discovery was looking for \u201csci-\nence per dollar,\u201d proposers would likely underbid as a strategy, coming in with plenty \nof \u201croom to the cap.\u201d Since room to the cost cap was ignored in most competitions in \nthe first twenty years of the Discovery Program, this strategy, and the recommendation, \ncould be set aside. The program continued to approach the process with the strategy \nof optimizing science return within the program cost cap instead. \nThe criterion that each mission should exhibit \u201ccompatibility between mission goals \nand scale\u201d is interesting in the context of the time; MESSENGER had, at the time, been \nrecently selected by the Discovery Program, and it was touted as \u201ca flagship-quality \nmission\u201d in a Discovery box.4 The study was correct in foreseeing that an incompat-\nibility would cause the program all kinds of problems, including the delay of future \nAnnouncements of Opportunity, as will be shown later in this chapter. However, that \ndid not stop the program from selecting the Kepler photometer the next year.\nThe \u201cbalanced-risk strategy\u201d became meaningless at about the time that the report \nwas issued, as the pendulum of NASA\u2019s risk tolerance swung far to the cautious side \nwith the 1999 Mars mission failures and the subsequent NASA Integrated Action Team \n4  \n\u201cLab wins Discovery mission.\u201d (1999, 9 July).
