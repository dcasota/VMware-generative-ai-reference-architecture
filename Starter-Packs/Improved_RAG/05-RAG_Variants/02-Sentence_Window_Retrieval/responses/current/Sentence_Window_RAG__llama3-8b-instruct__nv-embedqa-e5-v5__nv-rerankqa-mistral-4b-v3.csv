What is the function of the main longitudinal strength member in a seaplane's float?,The main longitudinal and continuous strength member located along the bottom and on the center line is called the keel.  It is used to provide longitudinal strength and stability to the float.  It is also used to prevent damage from handling or grounding.

A protective member attached along the bottom center line on the  outside, to prevent damage from handling or grounding.  Metacenter. ', 'This means that the float is practically free of trim.  Owing to the nature of the bottom of the forebody of the float, the relative  motion between the floats and the water tends to lift the bow of the former.  This  produces a tail-heavy moment on the float.  At some point, the longitudinal righting  moment and the thrust balance this tail-heavy moment so that the float assumes a  maximum trim angle just before the seaplane is put on the step.  Some floats may  have a bottom shape so that the bow is held down instead of being lifted.  Naturally,  such a condition is not desirable, for it is difficult to overcome this suction with the  air controls at low speeds.  Owing to some cause that has not yet been analyzed satisfactorily, some floats  porpoise in the take-off run. ', 'It has been shown in N.A.C.A.  Technical  Note No.  183 that the longitudinal metacentric height for either single or twin  floats is given with sufficient accuracy by the empirical equation \t G M equals K subscript 2 n L B cubed over delta: Equation 184G M equals K subscript 2 n L B cubed over delta: Equation 184 K2nLB 3 Δ \t G M equals K subscript 2 n L B cubed over delta: Equation 184 where n is the number of floats (i.e., one or two), B the beam of each float in ft.,  L the length in ft., ∆ the gross weight of the seaplane, and K2 a constant normally  varying between 1.90 and 2.40 with an average value of 2.10.

Single float seaplanes  and flying boats require the use of auxiliary floats on the wing tips in order to  secure transverse stability.  The usual method is to install the tip floats so that at  normal trim and draft they clear the water from 3 in.  to 8 in.

A model of a flying boat hull having one form of stub wings or sponsons to provide lateral stability was investigated.  Other forms of sponsons have been made for  tests with the same main hull, and in view of the later development of this type of  lateral stabilization, it is planned to extend the application of hulls of other shapes.  Floats for seaplanes.—In order to obtain information regarding the performance  of a good high-speed seaplane float, tests were made of a model of a float used on  the Macchi racer 1926.  As a result of the tests a float designed to be an improvement of this float and to be used as a parent of future series was tested.  This model  showed a marked improvement over the Macchi float.

Compare the management styles and priorities of Daniel Goldin and Administrator Truly at NASA.,"Daniel Goldin and Administrator Richard Truly had different management styles and priorities at NASA. Goldin was known for being intense, visionary, and hard-working, and he called himself a change agent. He was brought in by President George H. W. Bush to shake up NASA and institute a ""faster, better, cheaper"" (FBC) approach to robotic spacecraft development. Goldin was willing to take risks and challenge the traditional JPL approach, which was dominated by engineering considerations. He also prioritized diversity and inclusion, and his leadership style was marked by a willingness to challenge the status quo and make tough decisions.

On the other hand, Administrator Truly was an astronaut and had a more traditional approach to NASA's mission. He was not as focused on cost-cutting and was more concerned with the scientific and engineering aspects of the space program. Truly was not as willing to challenge the status quo and was more focused on maintaining the traditional NASA approach.

Overall, Goldin's management style was more aggressive and innovative, while Truly's was more conservative and traditional. Goldin's priorities were focused on cost-cutting, risk-taking, and diversity, while Truly's were focused on scientific and engineering excellence. Goldin's leadership style was marked by a willingness to challenge the status quo and make tough decisions, while Truly's was more focused on maintaining the traditional NASA approach.","['Although not known widely, in the  “black” space world he was highly regarded.   Goldin came with a reputation for being intense, even intimidating, in  style; visionary; and hard-working.  He called himself a change agent, and that  was what President George H. W. Bush wanted.  He had fired Goldin’s predecessor Richard Truly in part because he had not championed enthusiastically  Bush’s Moon-Mars human exploration initiative.  That was not a problem  2.\t  The Goldin section is based on a monograph by W. Henry Lambright, Transforming  Government: Dan Goldin and the Remaking of NASA (Washington, DC: IBM, 2001), as well  as ongoing research on the history of the robotic Mars program sponsored by NASA.

The PI would lead a “science investigation” to put the science at the forefront of the  proposal and the project, inverting the traditional JPL approach, which was dominated  by engineering considerations coming out of an era when it was a challenge just to get  the spacecraft safely to the Moon or a planet.  There was one more important context for Discovery’s emergence: it became the  poster child for Dan Goldin’s campaign to shake up NASA and institute a “faster, better, cheaper” (FBC) approach to robotic spacecraft development.4 The perception of  the space agency as bureaucratic, failure-prone, and expensive had risen quickly in  the early 1990s, notably because of the flawed mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope.   In early 1992, President George H. W. Bush replaced Administrator Richard Truly, an  astronaut, with Goldin, who had worked as an executive at the mostly military aerospace contractor TRW.

Goldin realized he had gone too far  at that point, but the lesson circulated through NASA like wildfire.  The term,  “stale, male, and pale,” may not have originated with Goldin, but it became the  match that lit a fire under NASA leadership in seeking much greater diversity  in hiring and promotion.  Everyone at NASA in the 1990s has a story about  the excesses of Dan Goldin’s leadership, and his record overall is far from  stellar, but he deserves kudos for shaking NASA out of lethargy in terms of  workplace diversity.  It would still take many years before a set of remarkably accomplished  women and minorities would rise to the highest leadership levels at NASA.  For  example, Carolyn Leach Huntoon became the first woman to lead a NASA  Center, recruited by Dan Goldin to serve as Johnson Space Center Director  between 1994 and 1996 before moving to a White House science and technology policy position.  She had been at NASA since 1970, working as a life scientist on Apollo and other human spaceflight programs. ', 'Barbara  Mikulski (D-MD), chair of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that handled NASA’s budget, summarized this position: “I truly believe that in space  station Freedom we are going to generate jobs today and jobs tomorrow—jobs  today in terms of the actual manufacturing of space station Freedom, but jobs  tomorrow because of what we will learn.”6 In the latter 1980s and early 1990s, a parade of space station managers and  NASA Administrators, each of them honest in their attempts to rescue the  program, wrestled with Freedom and lost.  They faced on one side politicians  who demanded that the jobs aspect of the project—itself a major cause of the  overall cost growth—be maintained, and with station users on the other side  demanding that Freedom’s capabilities be maintained, and with people on all  sides demanding that costs be reduced.  The incompatibility of these various  demands ensured that station program management was a task not without difficulties.  The NASA Administrator beginning 1 April 1992, Daniel S. Goldin,  was faced with a uniquely frustrating situation when these competing claims  were made official by the new President, William J. Clinton, who told him  in the spring of 1993 to restructure the space station program by reducing its  ']","Daniel Goldin favored horizontal management structures, short schedules, and low costs, whereas Administrator Truly's approach was not specified.

Analyze the role of end credits in documenting film production contributors.,"The role of end credits in documenting film production contributors is crucial in providing specific information and explanatory notes about people and events discussed.  The end credits also provide a way to group together multiple documents that have been related to one another in a significant way, working to tell one documentary ""story.""  The editorial method adopted seeks to preserve, as much as possible, the spelling, grammar, and language usage as they appear in the original documents.  The end credits also include marginal notations on the original documents, which are inserted into the text of the documents in brackets, each clearly marked as a marginal comment.  This information is essential in understanding the role of an Instrument Scientist, the functionality of the camera, and the calibrations done in flight.  The end credits also provide information about the personnel involved in the Apollo program, including the number of people employed by NASA and contractors working directly on the program.  Overall, the end credits play a vital role in documenting film production contributors, providing a comprehensive and detailed account of the people and events involved in the production.

This narrative persists beyond fiction.  Despite decades  of NEO research that have led to a global system of tracking asteroids and  predicting their future orbital paths, the perception that planetary impacts  are always unpredictable is rather widespread.  Consider that in the case of  a tragic shooting in a Colorado movie theater, lawyers for Cinemark USA,  in seeking dismissal of lawsuits filed against their client, said, “It would be  patently unfair, and legally unsound, to impose on Cinemark…the duty and  burden to have foreseen and prevented the criminal equivalent of a meteor  falling from the sky” [emphasis added].24  24.\t  Keith Coffman, “Cinemark, USA, Theatre Chain, Seeks Dismissal of Lawsuits in Colorado  Mass Shooting,” Reuters, 27 February 2012, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/28/ theater-seeks-dismissal-o_n_1921419.html (accessed 27 September 2012).

It’s much more nuanced than that, involving things like the correct planes and filters  to do color imaging.  “It’s also making sure that once you’re in orbit around Mercury,  you’re in the right orbit that your camera’s going to work, you’ve got the right amounts  of time to do that.” She explains that calibrations done in flight validated the camera’s  functionality and ironed out many of the quirks in the system and bugs in the software.31 Most instrument scientists on MESSENGER worked for the Applied Physics  Laboratory, and most of the spacecraft’s instruments were built there as well.

Taking advantage of the Earth approach by Eros in  late 1900 (to within 0.32 au), Oppolzer observed it at the German Potsdam  Observatory and was surprised to find that the asteroid faded by a factor  of 4 (an increase of 1.5 magnitudes) in 79 minutes and then returned to its  original brightness over the next few hours, only to wane yet again.30 The  entire brightness period took 5 hours and 16 minutes, a value in agreement  with more modern rotation period determinations.  It was recognized that this  was an effect due to the rotation of Eros and one of the following possibilities: the body had light and dark sides; two co-orbiting bodies were eclipsing  one another; or the body of Eros was irregularly shaped, so that its apparent  brightness depended upon which of its sides was being viewed.  By observing an object’s apparent brightness over long intervals of time,  one can determine the object’s rotation period from a plot of the asteroid’s  brightness as a function of time.

Compare the technological goals of the X-34 program with those of the DC-X and DC-XA programs.,"The X-34 program aimed to develop a reusable launch vehicle with a focus on rapid turnaround, low cost, and simplified procedures. The program aimed to achieve this through the use of embedded technologies, such as composite fuel tanks, composite intertank structures, and automated flight planning. The X-34 program also aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of reusing 94% of the vehicle's hardware, with the goal of reducing the cost of launching small satellites into low-Earth orbit.

In contrast, the DC-X and DC-XA programs focused on developing advanced technologies for single-stage-to-orbit space access. The DC-X was a one-third-scale, suborbital version of a proposed single-stage launch vehicle, while the DC-XA was a larger, orbital version of the same vehicle.

Operational philosophies include[d] the use of simplified procedures, small, well-trained crews, and flight data to verify functionality  of the system prior to the next launch.”11 These were all essential aspects of  reliable, rapid-turnaround, and reusable launch vehicle design.  To this end,  the X-34 incorporated a number of so-called “embedded technologies,” as  shown in Table 5.4.12 The DC-X and DC-XA Experience and Its Influence on the X-34 At first glance it might seem that the X-34 had little in common with the  VTOL DC-X and DC-XA Clipper Graham.  One was, effectively, a low-speed  takeoff-and-landing demonstrator, and the other was a potential Mach 8 hypersonic boost-glider.  In fact, however, Orbital benefited from the experience that  McDonnell Douglas had with the DC-X/DC-XA, for it had demonstrated that  ', 'Promise Denied 78 It was hoped that the DC-XA Clipper Graham, which was the first of the  three RLV program vehicles, would provide a number of benefits to the X-34  program.  These planned benefits included a composite fuel tank, a composite intertank structure, composite feedlines, an Inertial Navigation System  (INS) and Differential GPS, automated flight planning, streamlined flight/ ground operations, X-vehicle use of the White Sands Missile Range, and  rapid prototyping.36  An Optimistic Program Start A March 31, 1995, article in Aerospace Daily noted that Orbital’s and Rockwell’s  American Space Lines joint venture “wants to be launching 18 to 20 small satellites a year by 2005 on the commercial vehicle that derives from the X-34  prototype…[and that this number] would represent about two-thirds of the  smallest launch market that the joint venture executives hope will emerge if  they can cut the cost to put a satellite into low-Earth orbit by a factor of three,  a market roughly double the 15 worldwide launches a year in the 500-to- 3,000-pound payload class that exists today [1995].” The article added that  “[t]o get the cost down, engineers from Orbital, Rockwell, and NASA have  sketched a vehicle that would reuse about 94% of its hardware, throwing  away only a small orbital vehicle powered by a relatively cheap liquid oxygen/ kerosene rocket engine NASA will develop in-house based on work already  done at Marshall Space Flight Center.”37 Aerospace Daily’s editors further noted  that “[f]lying the X-34 from the top of the 747 [Space Shuttle carrier aircraft],  instead of dropping it from the bottom of the L-1011 [Orbital’s Pegasus rocket  carrier vehicle] gives engineers room to design a more circular [in cross section]  vehicle with the size and power to carry the heavier payloads, [Antonio] Elias  said.  The L-1011-launched ‘X-34A’ configuration would be able to take 1,200  pounds to LEO with a 76,300-pound gross weight.  The ‘X-34B,’ flying from  the 747[,] would weigh 108,500 pounds and be able to deliver 2,500 pounds to  LEO.”38 In regard to engines, the article added that the joint venture was studying a number of engines in the 85,000-pound up to nearly the 200,000-pound  power class, including Russian engines and the Rocketdyne MA-5 engine for  use in the reusable primary vehicle. ', 'Promise Denied 92 technology demonstrations and for flight-related experiments that would be  conducted on the new vehicle.  The new proposed X-34 was intended to be  an integral part of NASA’s overall reusable launch program and to enable “a  flight demonstration that was, from a performance standpoint, between the  DC-XA vehicle and the X-34 single-stage-to-orbit precursor vehicle.”85 The  design, aerodynamic modeling and testing, fabrication of the vehicle and its  component systems and subsystems, proposed flight testing, and termination  of this second program are discussed subsequently.  ', 'Promise Denied 38 The Phase II decision was “contingent on four programmatic criteria as well  as two enabling technical and two enhancing technical criteria, all of which  are supported by numerous specific technical metrics at the project and task  level during Phase I.”16 Phase II included the DC-XA Delta Clipper, the X-34,  and the preliminary design concept for the X-33.  The DC-XA program criteria stressed demonstrating, “by maintenance of run-out budget projections,  that a jointly funded, Government/industry project team can design, develop,  and integrate advanced technology components (including cryogenic tankage  and primary structure) into an experimental flight system within budget.”17  (Intriguingly, the agreement noted that actual flight testing was not required  in order to satisfy this criterion).  Overall, NASA and OMB stressed, the X-34  program was to demonstrate that the partnership of a co-funded, industry-led  Government/industry project team could “successfully show consistent progress toward the development of an advanced technology demonstrator with  commercial application to the space launch market.”18 Vertical Visions: The DC-X/XA Delta Clipper/Clipper Graham The NASA DC-XA Delta Clipper was an advanced version of the earlier DC-X  that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) tested as part of its  single-stage-to-orbit space access program.  The name—DC-X—was meant to  consciously recall the immensely successful Douglas DC-1 transport that had  spawned the DC-2 and DC-3 that revolutionized global air transport in the  mid-1930s.  The DC-X was a one-third-scale, suborbital version of a proposed  United States Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) single-stage  launch vehicle designated the DC-Y.  (As is traditional in American designation  schemes, X indicates an experimental system, while Y indicates a prototype of  a possible production system). ']","The X-34 program aimed to demonstrate low-cost operation, following in the footsteps of the DC-X and DC-XA programs, which broke new ground in low-cost operations with small workforce involvement in processing, launch, and rapid turnaround."
Compare Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's contributions to aircraft engine development with those of General Electric.,"Pratt & Whitney and General Electric Aircraft Engines both made significant contributions to aircraft engine development. Pratt & Whitney's JT3D engine, which was developed in the early 1960s, was a major improvement over the earlier JT3 turbojet engine and became the standard for commercial airliners. The JT3D engine was more efficient, quieter, and produced more thrust than the JT3 engine. Pratt & Whitney's contributions to aircraft engine development were also recognized by NASA, which awarded the company a contract to develop a new engine, the E3, in the 1970s. The E3 engine was designed to be more efficient and environmentally friendly than earlier engines and was used in the Boeing 777 airliner. General Electric, on the other hand, developed the CJ805 engine, which was designed to power the Convair 990 airliner. The CJ805 engine was not as successful as the JT3D engine, but it did lead to the development of the GE90 engine, which was used in the Boeing 777 airliner. General Electric's contributions to aircraft engine development were also recognized by NASA, which awarded the company a contract to develop the E3 engine. In summary, both Pratt & Whitney and General Electric made significant contributions to aircraft engine development, but Pratt & Whitney's contributions were more successful and widely adopted.","['It resulted  from considerable pioneering research and financial expense on the part of  both GE and the NACA, primarily in the newly emerging field of CFD.   Unfortunately, the airplane it was destined to power, the Convair 990 airliner,  was not yet ready.  The delay worked against the subsequent market success  of the CJ805, allowing rival Pratt & Whitney time to catch up with a rival  front-fan design, the JT3D.  Though initially resistant to the idea of the turbofan, Pratt & Whitney beat General Electric to the market by replacing the  first three low-pressure stages of the JT3 turbojet with two fan stages, which  improved thrust and fuel economy while reducing noise.  The resulting JT3D  generated 18,000 pounds of thrust, and the airlines quickly adopted it for the  707 and DC-8 aircraft in 1960.  Operators could convert their JT3s into JT3Ds  with a simple kit, an extraordinarily attractive enticement.  Pratt & Whitney  produced over 8,000 JT3D engines and dominated the growing market for  commercial turbofan engines in the early 1960s. ', 'Accessed December 26, 2012.

Putnam, Terrill W., and Ronald H. Smith. ', 'In both the near and intermediate terms, their  work at Lewis constituted the most significant contributions to improving fuel  efficiency for turbofans and commercial aircraft overall.75 The most beneficial  ACEE program for industry was E3 since it reinforced and improved the existing turbofan paradigm rather than creating an entirely new technology like  the ATP , which faced considerably more hurdles, not all of them technical.   E3 allowed engine manufacturers to invest in new innovations at a lower cost.   Since engine development was a high-risk proposition, Government funding  and research support made it possible.  Both GE and Pratt & Whitney incorporated E3 high-efficiency turbofan technology into their pioneering GE90  and PW4000 engines designed for the groundbreaking Boeing 777 airliner  in 1995.76 Meyer J. Benzakein, the chair of the aerospace engineering department at Ohio State University and a former GE engineer, assessed NASA’s  impact on jet engine technology before the House Subcommittee on Space and  Aeronautics in March 2005.  To Benzakein, without NASA’s E3 and the earlier  QEP , GE would not “have had the composite fan blades, the high pressure-ratio  core, or the low emission double annular combustor that put [the company]  in a leading position in the industry.”77 The technical legacy of ATP was significant.  A new generation of “commuter  propellers” driving turboprop airliners emerged in the 1990s.  With NASA data  in hand, Hamilton Standard and Hartzell Propeller of Piqua, OH, introduced  further refinements to the variable-pitch propeller. ', 'With NASA’s  support, they pushed into new territories focusing on components, nacelles,  exhaust-gas mixers, control systems, and accessories.  The estimated fuel savings increased to 15 percent.  Improved components accounted for half of that,  with the remainder coming from refined engine cycles and mixer nozzles.29  The basic E3 engine featured a single-stage fan, a 4-stage low-pressure compressor, a 9- or 10-stage high-pressure compressor, a 2-zone combustor, a  single-stage high-pressure turbine, a 4-stage low-pressure turbine, and a mixer.   Despite the similarities, GE and Pratt & Whitney went about developing  new and different engine configurations and component technologies from  1976 to 1984.30 GE integrated its E3 components into an actual engine.  A crucial focus was  the annular combustors.  GE’s E3 combustors were a continuation of the two- stage combustor studies initiated by the earlier Experimental Clean Combustor  Program (ECCP).  That work contributed to a broader knowledge of how to  reduce emission levels before the challenging work on engine performance and  operation began.31 At the end of the program in 1985, Donald Y. Davis, the GE  E3 program manager, reported that it met all goals for efficiency, environmental  considerations, and economic payoff. ']","Pratt & Whitney Aircraft contributed to aircraft engine development through the 578-DX demonstrator engine, Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles (ACTIVE) program, and Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program. In contrast, General Electric's contributions include the F101 engine, F404 turbofan, F414 engine, GE36 UDF UHB engine, GE90 engine series, and GEnx turbofan."
"Compare the roles of Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations in studying asteroids, particularly in the case of (66391) 1999 KW4.","Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations have played crucial roles in studying asteroids, particularly in the case of (66391) 1999 KW4. Arecibo radar observations have been used to determine the size, shape, rotation rate, and surface roughness of near-Earth objects, including asteroids. Goldstone radar observations have also been used to study asteroids, particularly in the case of (66391) 1999 KW4. The Goldstone antenna is more sensitive than the Arecibo antenna, but it is fixed, whereas the Arecibo antenna is movable. This allows the Goldstone antenna to track the target and observe it over larger regions of sky and integrate the signal over longer intervals of time. The Arecibo antenna is more sensitive, but it is fixed, which makes it less effective for tracking targets.

What was the purpose of the X-34 RLV concept in terms of space transportation and payload delivery?,"The X-34 RLV concept aimed to develop a low-cost launcher for commercial and government payloads, with the goal of reducing the cost of launching small payloads to low Earth orbit from $10,000 to $1,000 per pound. The program aimed to demonstrate key reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technologies and operational practices on an accelerated schedule, with the ultimate goal of creating a financially viable X-34 that could return the U.S. to leadership in commercial space transportation. The X-34 was designed to be a commercial technical demonstrator, with a focus on low-cost operations, rapid turnaround, simplified maintenance and payload integration, and simple interfaces. The program also aimed to support NASA's and the Department of Defense's (DOD) needs for smaller, cheaper, faster type payloads, with the potential for up to six flights per year at a cost of about $5 million per launch for a 1,000-pound payload. Overall, the X-34 RLV concept was intended to break paradigms and push the technology envelope to advance the field of space transportation and payload delivery.","['The “First” X-34: A Prequel 75 pathfinder for future reusable vehicles (RLV), both as a demonstrator of important technologies and operational methods and as a model for industry-led,  NASA-assisted development partnerships.”31 Rockwell’s letter, which was dated  one day earlier, noted that “We view X-34 as an outstanding opportunity for  industry and Government to pioneer new ways of doing business, demonstrate  needed technologies for future reusable launch vehicles, and strengthen the  competitive position of the U.S.  space launch industry.32 Rockwell added that: NASA’s and Rockwell’s experience in hypersonic flight and reusable space operations from highly reliable systems like X-15 and  Space Shuttle, coupled with OSC’s small launch system experience from Pegasus and Taurus and “faster, better, cheaper” capabilities for small satellites, provide an unprecedented team for  X-34.  Our program approach takes full advantage of the complementary strengths of each team member to achieve our primary  goals of using X-34 as an operational launch system that significantly reduces the cost of launching small payloads and demonstrating key RLV technologies and operational practices on an  accelerated schedule.  In addition, we take full advantage of the  results and ongoing work under Rockwell’s existing RLV cooperative agreements with NASA Centers on integrated propulsion  technology, reusable cryogenic composite tanks, graphite composite primary structures, and lightweight durable TPS.

For an aerospace industry faced with atrophy of its traditional government customer, the X-34 project will eventually  stress a launcher in a grueling and still largely unfamiliar test regime—the  free market.”6 Gary E. Payton, then NASA’s Deputy Associate Administrator for Space  Transportation and Technology, proved a key figure in advancing the program.   Payton, who thought that the X-33 should be supported by a smaller technology demonstrator, contacted the USAF’s Air Force Materiel Command  (AFMC) at Wright-Patterson AFB, in Dayton, Ohio, to request the next available X vehicle number, which turned out to be the X-34.7 NASA Marshall Briefs the Industry on X-33 and X-34 Prior to the issuance of the formal Cooperative Agreement Notice, NASA  Marshall presented an X-33 and X-34 overview briefing on October 19, 1994.  ', 'Daniel Goldin was reported to have even challenged NASA Marshall by saying that “[b]reaking paradigms was expected and  occasional mission failures along the way would be tolerated.” Later, however,  he directed that the X-34 had to have redundant systems.  From the outset,  both NASA and Orbital realized that they were pushing the technology envelope, but by doing so were hoping to advance the technology, leading to the  ultimate goal of lowering the cost of launching payloads to low Earth orbit  from $10,000 to $1,000 per pound.  This subsequently changed to requiring  a fully redundant risk mitigation policy that led to significant cost increases  and schedule slippage that ultimately lead to program termination due to lack  of additional funding.

Also, the Department of Defense was launching 3 to 4 satellites per year in  this class at this time.  NASA and the DOD thus presented an opportunity for  a Government-industry joint effort to develop this capability for the benefit  of both parties.10 NASA’s X-34 “Should Cost” Price Model Estimates In March 1994, as preparation for the program, NASA Marshall’s Engineering  Cost Office developed a “should cost” estimate of what later became the X-34  RSB, although at the time, it was simply designated as a hypersonic reusable  vehicle (HSRV).  The office estimated that the program would cost $380 million (in 2016 dollars, equivalent to $618 million) using “traditional” estimation  techniques including a Government cost model and adoption of best commercial practices.11 At the same time, the Engineering Cost Office attempted  an estimate based on an analysis of Orbital’s Pegasus program.

In his “Star Warriors on Sky Patrol,” published  in the New York Times, University of Maryland physicist Robert L. Park  commented, “As calls for more and bigger bombs continued, Lowell Wood,  Dr.  Teller’s protégé at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, could not  contain his excitement; from the back of the auditorium he shouted, ‘Nukes  forever!’” And Park continued, “In defending Earth against this minuscule  threat, the Star Warriors would create a vastly greater hazard of nuclear missiles at the ready.

', 'A History of Near-Earth Objects Research 118 and future technologies concluded that “chemical or nuclear rockets with  nuclear explosives are the only present or near-term technology options available that have significant probability of success without significant research  and development activities.”34 The Interception Workshop report issued in February 1993 (hereafter “Interception Workshop Report”) acknowledged that the use of nuclear  devices for deflection purposes would “require appropriate international agreements and protocols.”35 Moreover, Ahrens and Harris advocated holding off   on any actual engineering designs for the approaches discussed in their study  “because of the low probability of impact of hazardous asteroids, the high  cost in the face of a low risk factor, and the rapid changes that are expected  in defence systems technology.”36 Even so, the eagerness of some participants  to resort to nuclear weapons alarmed many NEO scientists present at the  Interception Workshop and generated a divide between the two communities.  At a meeting hosted by Tom Gehrels at the University of Arizona in  Tucson in January 1993, the AIAA’s Tagliaferri recalled a long conversation  he had with Carl Sagan, a vocal opponent of developing deflection technologies.  Sagan was convinced that the ability to divert an asteroid from its course  would inevitably fall into the wrong hands and be turned to ill purposes.37  Tagliaferri understood the concern but felt the impact hazard warranted the  risk because the argument against nuclear deflection could not hold up against  calculations like those of Ahrens and Harris.  “The numbers don’t lie.  If you’re  going to move these things, you’re going to need that kind of energy density,  and nothing else will do that.”38 Many of the NEO scientists at the meeting found these suggestions both  unnecessary and dangerous, and some felt that the weapons scientists were  34.\t  Canavan, Solem, and Rather, “Proceedings of the Near-Earth-Object Interception  Workshop,” p.

Yet, as mentioned above, when asked about asteroid impact  hazards, most people say they do not consider them a believable threat.  A  2010 Pew Research Center poll found that a combined 62 percent of respondents said an asteroid hitting Earth by 2050 “will probably not happen” and  “will definitely not happen,” while a combined 31 percent did entertain the  possibility, including 5 percent who said it “will definitely happen.” These  results are practically identical with those of a 1999 Pew poll that posed the  same question.18 Howard McCurdy has argued that the idea of an “asteroid impact threat”  was first promoted in an attempt to stimulate space exploration after the  Apollo era.  He has found that the “threat” was not made believable even  then: “Warnings about asteroids and comets striking the Earth mobilized a  response feeble by comparison to space efforts incited by the Cold War.  The  Cold War really scared people, and asteroids do not.”19 15.\t  See NASA, “Asteroid 2012 DA14—Earth Flyby Reality Check,” 15 February 2013, http:// www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/asteroidflyby.html (accessed 31 April 2013); and  Don Yeomans and Paul Chodas, “Additional Details on the Large Fireball Event over Russia  on Feb.  15, 2013,” NASA, 1 March 2013, http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fireball_130301.html  (accessed 31 February 2013).

What evidence supports the claim that the X-34 Program was successful despite its cancellation and numerous challenges?,"There is no evidence in the provided text that supports the claim that the X-34 Program was successful despite its cancellation and numerous challenges. In fact, the text highlights several challenges and failures that led to the program's cancellation, including disagreements over engine choice, missed design milestones, and budget overruns. The text also mentions that the program was terminated due to a lack of funding and that the test article was being readied for flight-testing when the program was cancelled. Overall, the text presents a negative view of the X-34 Program's success.  Context information from multiple sources is below.

[It should be noted that risk-mitigation  plans did exist prior to the restructuring in 2000, but that NASA’s  tolerance of risk had lessened greatly since the era of the X-15, Apollo,  and the early days of the Space Shuttle.]  •\t Contrary to the Agency’s own policy, NASA failed to prepare program commitment agreements or program plans at the beginning  of the X-33 and X-34 programs. ', 'Finally, the GAO testimony reviewed the budget overrun and schedule  slippage as follows: Similarly, NASA started the X-34 Project, and the related  NASA engine development project, with limited government  funding, an accelerated development schedule, and insufficient  reserves to reduce development risks and ensure a successful  test program.  Based on a NASA X-34 restructure plan in June  2000, we estimate that NASA’s total funding requirements  for the X-34 would have increased to about $348 million— a 307-percent ($263 million) increase from the estimated  $86 million budgeted for the vehicle and engine development  projects in 1996.  Also, since 1996, the projected first powered flight had slipped about 4 years from September 1998  to October 2002 due to the cumulative effect of added risk  mitigation tasks, vehicle and engine development problems,  and testing delays.34 The GAO testimony reviewed above combined the X-33 and X-34 together  in their Statement of Testimony and noted very specific failures regarding the  X-33 vehicle and its components, including the composite fuel tank.  This raises  the question as to what extent the failure of the X-33 influenced the termination of the X-34 project, and whether lumping both programs together was  (and is now, in historical retrospect) “fair” to the X-34.   While the two programs/projects were connected, the X-34 program had  a number of standalone attributes.  For example, the X-33 was to demonstrate  single-stage-to-orbit technology, while the X-34 was to demonstrate reusability  technology and rapid, low-cost operations.  Also, neither the OIG report nor  the GAO testimony apparently considered the fact that the X-34, unlike the  X-33, was already built and the test article was being readied for flight-testing  when the program was terminated. ']","There is no evidence in the provided context that supports the claim that the X-34 Program was successful despite its cancellation and numerous challenges. The context primarily discusses the program's challenges, delays, and cancellation, with no mention of its success."
"Considering the rotor's speed stability and fuselage's instability, what longitudinal stability characteristics are exhibited by the helicopter in forward flight?","The helicopter exhibits some undesirable tendencies in the longitudinal control, such as ""zooming"" at low forward speeds following take-off, pitching upward abruptly, and sometimes requiring full forward stick motion to regain control of the machine. At normal cruising speed, the conventional helicopter is usually dynamically unstable in pitch, but only mildly so, with a long enough period to allow the pilot to recognize the disturbance and correct it. The instability becomes greater as the forward speed is increased, requiring increased attentiveness from the pilot to correct for a disturbance. The elimination of this pitching instability is considered to be of primary importance in achieving satisfactory flying qualities.","['In forward flight, the normal helicopter may exhibit some undesirable tendencies in the longitudinal control.

At normal cruising  speed the conventional helicopter is usually dynamically unstable in pitch, but only  mildly so, with a long enough period to allow the pilot to recognize the disturbance  and correct it.

Because of this  increase of angle-of-attack instability with forward speed, the attentiveness required  of the pilot to correct for a disturbance increases rapidly as the helicopter’s top  speed is reached, in that at those speeds the disturbance builds up so rapidly that  corrective control must be applied in a few seconds.  The elimination of this pitching instability is considered to be of primary importance in achieving satisfactory  flying qualities.  Many experimental helicopters, and several production machines,  already incorporate devices which either increase the damping in pitch or add positive static stability with angle of attack. ', '665 Document 5-44 (a–b) Longitudinal Stability in Forward Flight: During the course of the performance tests, considerable flying was done at relatively high speeds, approaching the  limits imposed by blade stalling.  It was found quite difficult to hold steady conditions because of a strong tendency of the machine to diverge in pitch, creating the  impression of balancing on a ball.  This characteristic seemed far more pronounced  with some of the rotors tested than with others, but was always troublesome.  Upward  pitching was most troublesome as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling,  which added to the difficulties because it increased the tendency to pitch up and  was accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. ', 'The conventional helicopter is thus dynamically unstable  in hovering.  The instability is easily controllable, however, and is not considered  a serious handicap in the machine inasmuch as the period of the oscillation is  long enough to allow for the pilot’s reaction time in perceiving and correcting the  motion.  There are several means of stabilizing the helicopter in hovering, all of  which utilize gyroscopic forces.

Analyze the impact of NASA's budget reallocation on international collaborative space projects.,"The impact of NASA's budget reallocation on international collaborative space projects is significant. According to the sources, NASA's budget reallocation has led to changes in the planned funding profiles for PI-led missions, which can disrupt the planned funding profiles for international collaborative space projects. This is evident in the case of the Cassini project, where NASA's budget reallocation led to a dramatic reconfiguration of the project to reduce its cost. Similarly, the OOE mission was affected by NASA's budget cuts, which threatened the planned new start for the mission.

Moreover, the sources suggest that NASA's budget reallocation can create an increasingly discouraging environment for international contributions to PI-led missions. The ITAR regulations, which are subject to change, can also create barriers to teaming and higher perceived risk for missions including international partners.

In addition, the sources highlight the importance of program offices in the success of PI-led missions. If program offices are appropriately located and staffed, and offer enabling infrastructure for projects, they can play a critical positive role in the success of international collaborative space projects.

Overall, NASA's budget reallocation can have a significant impact on international collaborative space projects, creating challenges and uncertainties for international partners. However, with the right program offices and infrastructure in place, these challenges can be mitigated, and international collaborative space projects can still be successful.","['50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES 236 No less irritation was expressed by the European space science community.  SSAC Chairman David Southwood wrote to his American counterpart, NASA Space Science and Applications Advisory Committee Chairman  Barrien Moore, that slipping the launch of Cassini to 1997 would create “an  intolerable stress” on the ESA program.  “I cannot emphasise enough the  change [it] can easily induce in the climate of cooperation,” Southwood concluded.18 NASA’s credibility as a reliable partner was explicitly challenged  by ESA member state delegations in the SPC: “It should be impressed upon  NASA that international cooperation was a valid proposition only as long as  the partners honoured their commitments,” pointed out the Dutch delegate.19 Despite all efforts, it was hardly possible for ESA and the European scientists to influence the congressional debates in the United States on the federal  budget.  In autumn 1989, Congress had approved the CRAF/Cassini program  within a budget limit of $1.6 billion, but the cost of Cassini alone was now  estimated at about $1.7 billion, and implementation of the whole program  was definitely jeopardized.  NASA canceled the CRAF mission and undertook a dramatic reconfiguration of the Cassini project in order to reduce  its cost.   A new budgetary crisis arose in 1994, when Congress threatened to dramatically reduce the NASA budget. ', '295 CHAPTER 12\u2002 •\u2002 International Cooperation In Solar System Exploration  the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the United States will participate  in this mission.”43  While technical and scientific development of the OOE mission continued from 1977 to 1978, securing funding for the cooperative mission was  increasingly a problem.44 For instance, in May 1977, NASA anticipated a  $77 million cut to its FY 1978 budget request.  This cut would have a particular impact on the Agency’s planetary program, especially the planned new  start for a Jupiter orbiter/probe.  The OOE mission was affected, as the question arose of “what effect…the delayed new start [would] have on plans to use  the same basic Jupiter spacecraft design as part of the NASA/ESA proposed  out-of-ecliptic mission.”45 In July, the House of Representatives appropriated $17.7 million for the Jupiter orbiter/probe mission, with the stipulation  that the planned 1979 new-start for the OOE mission would use a variant  of the Jupiter mission spacecraft.  Without this new budget approval for the  Jupiter probe mission, OOE mission plans would have been threatened.46  Requesting more funding for the OOE mission, which by late 1977 had been  renamed the Solar Polar Mission, was becoming increasingly difficult.

Provided no cost escalation occurs,  the project becomes legally binding for member states, and there is no threat  of cancellation.  NASA, on the contrary, is a national agency whose overall  program and budget has to be negotiated annually with the White House  and Congress.  Funds can always be shifted from one program to another on  the basis of political considerations, lobbying, or national security priorities.  HORIZON 2000 In January 1985, the Ministerial Conference of ESA member states approved  a long-term plan for space science called Horizon 2000.4 The basic philosophy of Horizon 2000 was the establishment of two classes of projects.  The  first included four pre-defined “Cornerstones”—ambitious and technologically challenging missions to be realized according to a phased schedule  over a 20-year period.  The Cornerstone missions were devoted respectively  to solar-terrestrial physics, x-ray astronomy, planetary science, and infrared  astronomy.

Explore the development of advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft.,"The Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP) was a large-scale, multimillion-dollar collaborative effort between NASA, industry, and academia to develop advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft. The project aimed to address the technical issues inherent in turboprop engines that, if overcome, would encourage the engines' increased use by manufacturers and commercial air carriers.

The ATP was a response to the need for more efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft engines. The project focused on the development of a new type of turboprop engine, known as the ""propfan,"" which featured multiple highly loaded, swept blades. The propfan was designed to be more efficient in terms of thrust and fuel economy, and it generated less noise than both piston and turbojet engines.

The ATP was a collaborative effort between NASA, industry, and academia. NASA provided research expertise, test and evaluation equipment facilities, and management of over 40 industrial contracts and 15 university grants. Industry partners included Hamilton Standard, GE, Lockheed, Allison, Pratt & Whitney, Rohr Industries, Gulfstream, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing, who brought expertise, their own development facilities, and specialist and airframe perspective to turboprop development.

The ATP was a significant step forward in the development of advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft. The project demonstrated the potential for turboprop engines to be more efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective than traditional piston and turbojet engines. The ATP also highlighted the importance of collaboration between government, industry, and academia in the development of new technologies.

', 'In 1974, Lewis engineer Daniel Mikkelson met with Carl Rohrbach,  who worked for the last major propeller manufacturer in the United States— Hamilton Standard of Windsor Locks, CT—to discuss an advanced turboprop concept with multiple highly loaded, swept blades called a “propfan.” A  turboprop was efficient in terms of thrust and fuel economy, and it generated  less noise than both piston and turbojet engines.  There was an additional two  decades of experience in the use of computational fluid dynamics and structural  mechanics in the design of supersonic wings, helicopter rotors, and fan blades.   The application of that knowledge to the propeller was the key to increased  fuel savings.  As part of the ACEE, the ATP aimed to address the technical  issues inherent in turboprop engines that, if overcome, would encourage the  engines’ increased use by manufacturers and commercial air carriers.  As with  the E3 project, the new system needed to be safe, efficient, and clean overall.40 The ATP was a large-scale, multimillion-dollar collaborative effort between  NASA, industry, and academia.  On the NASA side, each of the four aeronautics  Centers—Lewis, Langley, Dryden, and Ames—played major roles in providing  research expertise, test and evaluation equipment facilities, and management  of over 40 industrial contracts and 15 university grants.  The industrial partners included Hamilton Standard, GE, Lockheed, Allison, Pratt & Whitney,  Rohr Industries, Gulfstream, McDonnell Douglas, and Boeing, who also  brought expertise, their own development facilities, and specialist and airframe  perspective to turboprop development.

What is the mean diameter of the satellite orbiting the 1.5 km primary asteroid?,"500 meters. The satellite orbits the primary asteroid every 17.4 hours. The primary has a rapid rotation period of about 2.8 hours. The satellite was discovered by the Galileo Imaging Team member Ann Harch. The satellite was named Dactyl. The satellite was first radar discovered in 2000 DP107, which was observed by the Goldstone and Arecibo radars in September and October 2000. The satellite revolved about the 800-meter-sized primary with an orbital period of 1.755 days. The mass of the primary was determined using Kepler’s third law, and the bulk density of the primary was estimated to be about 1.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The primary has a rapid rotation period of about 2.8 hours, although earlier in its lifetime it presumably spun a bit faster when shedding material.

The primary  has a rapid rotation period of about 2.8 hours, although earlier in its lifetime  it presumably spun a bit faster when shedding material.  As used in 2018, this 3D modeling technique begins with an attempt to fit  the radar dataset with an ellipsoid, and if the spin-pole direction is not known  in advance, then a trial-and-error grid search is undertaken whereby the pole  direction is systematically varied until there is a best fit of the radar observations.  The technique can then proceed using more sophisticated shape representations until the rotating shape model allows an accurate representation of  the time history of the observed radar frequency bandwidths.  To help ensure  that the derived shape model evolves toward reality, certain constraints or  penalties are assigned if the model begins to evolve into an unrealistic shape.

Investigate the effects of microgravity on mouse skeletal muscle adaptation.,"According to the provided information, the effects of microgravity on mouse skeletal muscle adaptation have been studied in several experiments. For example, a study published in PLOS ONE in 2012 found that mouse skeletal muscle adapts to long-term microgravity by activating certain inherent compensatory and protective pathways (Sandonà et al., 2012). Another study published in Scientific Reports in 2017 found that the force-producing extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle may resist microgravity-induced atrophy by activating certain inherent compensatory and protective pathways (Shiba et al., 2017). Additionally, a study published in NASA's ISS benefits for humanity 3rd ed-508.pdf found that the microgravity-induced bone loss was due to both an increased bone resorption and a decreased bone deposition, and that the protection observed in transgenic mice overexpressing the PTN (pleiotrophin) protein was likely due to higher osteoblast activity, which aids in bone formation (Tavella et al., 2012). Overall, these studies suggest that mouse skeletal muscle adapts to microgravity by activating certain compensatory and protective pathways, and that artificial gravity countermeasures may be necessary to maintain muscle and bone health during long-duration space missions.  Context information from multiple sources is below.

(Shiba et al., 2017).  Studies have also shown  that spaceflight activates lipotoxic pathways (i.e.,  an accumulation of lipid products in cells) in mouse  liver, initiates a loss of retinol, and creates a possible  increased risk of fatty liver disease, thereby opening  new research questions surrounding liver metabolism  and function (Jonscher et al., 2016).   In a long-term mouse mission of 91 days, results  suggest that the force-producing extensor digitorum  longus (EDL) muscle may resist microgravity-induced  atrophy by activating certain inherent compensatory  and protective pathways (Cancedda et al., 2012).   These studies also show an increased sensitivity of  the “antigravity” soleus muscle—the muscle responsible  for walking and standing activities—adding insight  into the mechanisms for resistance of EDL that could  contribute to the development of countermeasures  to muscle loss in space (Sandonà et al., 2012).   Moreover, analysis of specific bone formation and  resorption marker expression in these mice suggested  that the microgravity-induced bone loss was due to  both an increased bone resorption and a decreased  bone deposition.  More specifically, the protection  observed in transgenic mice overexpressing the PTN  (pleiotrophin) protein was likely due to higher osteoblast  activity, which aids in bone formation (Tavella et al.,  2012).  In mouse cardiovascular studies, mice flown  to the space station for 8 days showed a decreased  expression of calcium channels, which regulate the  contractibility of smooth muscle cells in portal veins  that carry blood to the liver.

How do lateral projections like sponsons enhance transverse stability in a seaplane's float or hull?,"Lateral projections like sponsons enhance transverse stability in a seaplane's float or hull by increasing planing area or transverse stability. They provide additional planing surface and increased lateral stability, which helps to overcome negative metacentric height and prevent the seaplane from tipping over on its side. This is particularly important for seaplanes that operate in rough seas, as it helps to maintain stability and prevent capsizing. Additionally, sponsons can also help to ""beat down"" the spray, reducing the amount of water that splashes over the sides of the hull. This can improve the overall performance and safety of the seaplane.","['Speed, hump.  The speed or speeds at which the water resistance is a maximum.  Sponsons.  Lateral projections added to the sides of a float or hull to increase planing area or transverse stability.  Spray strips.  Thin longitudinal strips of triangular cross-section attached to the  bottom along the chine to “beat down” the spray.  Squatting. ', '329 Document 5-23 (a–c) •\t Either tip floats (Sikorsky S-42) or “sponsons” (Boeing 314 and Martin 130)  used for lateral stability.  (A sponson is a structural projection appearing as a  kind of ridge along the side at the bottom of the hull, providing additional  planing surface and increased lateral stability.)  •\t Either full cantilever wings (Boeing 314) or a limited number of supporting  struts (Sikorsky S-42 and Martin M 130).  •\t Either a hull with two transverse steps (Sikorsky S-42 and Martin 130) or a  single-step hull with an afterbody tapering to a sharp stern post (Boeing 314). ', 'Also  high above the hull was a  horizontal tail, which was  fitted upon a long vertical  fin that itself extended well  above the hull from the rear  of the fuselage.  All of this  was done to keep the aerodynamic surfaces—not to mention the two engines mounted  between the wings—out of  the water spray during takeoff.   Very importantly, what came  to be known as “tip floats”  were placed atop the upper  wing and beneath the lower  wing.  Curtiss realized that any relatively narrow-beamed hull with such a high center of gravity (caused by the aircraft superstructure) needed floats to overcome what  naval architects called “negative metacentric height.”7 This is what caused a boat  to become laterally unstable while moving through water.  In smooth water, a flying boat could motor through liftoff without experiencing much lateral instability,  and neither float at the tips of the wings would need to touch water.  But military  patrol boats like the H-16 spent many days in rough seas, and on those occasions,  floats stopped the accelerating amphibian from tipping over on its side.  (Later,  some flying-boat designers used “sponsons” for lateral stability; these were short  and stubby little wings that projected from the bottom of the hull on each side.) ', 'This model, no.  22, showed a general  performance much superior to the previous model.  These results will be issued as  a technical note and it is hoped that a full-scale test of this form may be made to  determine its behavior under operating conditions.  A model of a flying boat hull having one form of stub wings or sponsons to provide lateral stability was investigated.  Other forms of sponsons have been made for  tests with the same main hull, and in view of the later development of this type of  lateral stabilization, it is planned to extend the application of hulls of other shapes.  Floats for seaplanes.—In order to obtain information regarding the performance  of a good high-speed seaplane float, tests were made of a model of a float used on  the Macchi racer 1926.  As a result of the tests a float designed to be an improvement of this float and to be used as a parent of future series was tested. ']",Lateral projections like sponsons enhance transverse stability in a seaplane's float or hull by increasing the planning area.
"How did NASA Lewis's PSL contribute to the development of engines for aircraft like F-14, F-15, F-16, and B-1?","According to the text, NASA Lewis's PSL contributed to the development of later American military aircraft, including the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, and Rockwell B-1 Lancer, by solving the inlet-engine compatibility problems related to the F-111. This research proved beneficial to the development of these later aircraft. However, it is not explicitly stated how the PSL directly contributed to the development of these specific aircraft. The text only mentions that the research conducted to solve the inlet-engine compatibility problems related to the F-111 proved beneficial to the development of later American military aircraft. Therefore, the answer is that NASA Lewis's PSL contributed to the development of later American military aircraft, but the specific contribution to the development of F-14, F-15, F-16, and B-1 is not mentioned.","['The strategic bomber variant, the FB-111A, flew into the 1990s.  The Royal  Australian Air Force, the only foreign customer for the aircraft, operated the  F-111C from 1973 to 2010.  Overall, the F-111 experience was an extremely cautionary tale for the  American aerospace industry on the issue of commonality and on the problems  of airframe-engine integration.  For the long term, the research conducted to  solve the inlet-engine compatibility problems related to the F-111 proved  beneficial to the development of later American military aircraft, including the  Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics  F-16 Fighting Falcon, and Rockwell B-1 Lancer.28 Developing and Refining Advanced  Military Aircraft Engines The Military and NASA Lewis’s Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) Since its creation, NASA supported engine development for American aircraft.

Ironically, it involved a  bit of catch-up: with the researchers and facilities in Cleveland committed to  space during the 1956–1966 focus, the PSL had been relatively subordinated  in air-breathing engine development by the Air Force’s Arnold Engineering  Development Center in Tennessee.  This facility, inspired by the German Kochel  high-speed tunnel complex discovered at the end of the Second World War, had  opened in 1951 and quickly gained a reputation for analytical excellence using  a variety of tunnels, shock tubes, and other research tools.  As well, the PSL had  been somewhat supplanted (though to a lesser degree) by the growing capabilities of industrial research facilities maintained by the aeropropulsion industry  itself.

', 'Miller, the latter clearly overshadowed the former during the Agency’s first  decade.1 Nevertheless, NASA’s work in aircraft propulsion during the 1960s  and 1970s reflected the Agency’s contributions to military high-speed flight  and subsonic commercial aviation, which included the first in-depth studies  into improved fuel economy and the growing public concern over engine noise  and emissions.  The NACA’s seminal legacy in aeronautics changed dramatically with the  creation of NASA.  Quickly, the personnel, tools, and techniques used to investigate aircraft propulsion challenges became enlisted in the space race.  The  research conducted in the PSL at Lewis, created to evaluate gas turbine and  rocket engines for flight in the atmosphere, is a case in point.  After Sputnik in  1957 and the creation of NASA in 1958, the Cleveland facility shifted its focus.   PSL researchers made important contributions to the Pratt & Whitney RL-10  liquid-fueled rocket that powered the Centaur and Saturn upper-stage rockets.   They also worked on the first stage of the Apollo program’s Saturn V rocket.

What risks did Carl Sagan highlight in asteroid deflection efforts?,Carl Sagan highlighted the risk that the ability to divert an asteroid from its course would inevitably fall into the wrong hands and be turned to ill purposes.

In his “Star Warriors on Sky Patrol,” published  in the New York Times, University of Maryland physicist Robert L. Park  commented, “As calls for more and bigger bombs continued, Lowell Wood,  Dr.  Teller’s protégé at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, could not  contain his excitement; from the back of the auditorium he shouted, ‘Nukes  forever!’” And Park continued, “In defending Earth against this minuscule  threat, the Star Warriors would create a vastly greater hazard of nuclear missiles at the ready.

', 'A History of Near-Earth Objects Research 246 The scarcity of mineral resources on Mars was consistent with a notion of  planetary evolution that was emerging in early-20th-century planetary science.  Percival Lowell, for example, wrote in 1906 about one phase of the  process he believed to be the reason behind his “canals”: “Study of the several  planets of our solar system, notably the Earth, Moon, and Mars, reveals tolerably legibly an interesting phase of a planet’s career, which apparently must  happen to all such bodies, and evidently has happened or is happening to  these three: the transition of its surface from a terraqueous to a purely terrestrial condition.”3 If Mars was in transition from a vibrant Earth-like planet  to a lifeless Moon-like one, then this evolutionary path would eventually take  its course on our own planet.  As Robert Markley traces in his book Dying  Planet: Mars in Science and the Imagination, this theme of loss and dwindling  resources played out in both science fiction and environmental concerns of  the day.  These anxieties persisted and would later be rekindled by the 1972  “Limits to Growth” report by the Club of Rome, which sparked a wave of  modern interest in the prospect of space colonization as an alternative to terrestrial disaster.4 In contrast to the specter of resource depletion at home, the  seeming abundance of valuable space resources allowed for a ready comparison between the cold reaches of space and the American frontier, where new  resources could always be found.  By the middle of the century, the archetype  of the asteroid miner as explorer and frontiersman was well established in the  realm of science fiction, and in the decades that followed, a surge of enthusiasm for space settlement and resource utilization pushed to bring the sci-fi  trope of conquering the final frontier into reality.

With all the terrestrial junk that the U.S.  and Soviet/Russian space agencies have deposited on Mars—on purpose and by accident—since the 1970s,  some skeptics have raised the question of whether the planet may already be  contaminated with Earth life.71  For planetary protection, the story of S. mitis on the Moon illustrates,  among other things, that microbes are everywhere (on Earth), cleanroom  procedures for microbial assays cannot be too careful, and meticulous and  complete records of such procedures must be made and preserved.  For the  history and sociology of science, this case shows how a claim that was never  subjected to formal peer review and became, and remained, a fact for decades  before it was seriously challenged; and how it took visual evidence to finally  make the case that multiple sources had made verbally.

They learned from each other's strengths and weaknesses, with the PI gaining a better understanding of the engineering process and the project manager gaining a deeper appreciation for the science requirements. The collaboration was characterized by mutual respect, trust, and open communication, which enabled them to work together effectively and achieve the project's goals.

The next Dawn project manager, who appeared at another critical juncture, agreed  that the working relationship between the project manager and PI was essential.

Insights from the PIs At the end of each interview, the PI was asked to identify the characteristics or skills  important for a good project manager.  This is a role that had been discussed repeatedly  within management institutions; funding agencies; and organizations such as APPEL,  the Academy of Program/Project and Engineering Leadership at NASA; and yet the  reflections here, collected in 2009, provide a new dimension of such discourse.  The  PIs were given the opportunity to discuss what they had learned about the role of the  project manager over the course of the development of their missions, just as the PMs  had been asked to talk about the role of the PI.  Each PI defined the role of project manager, agreed to the appointment of said  project manager, and was responsible for the work of the project manager, and yet most  were somewhat humbled by the fact that, in the end, it was the project manager who  really had the power and skills to deliver a working spacecraft to the launch pad.  The  Genesis PI dealt with this dichotomy by recognizing that the project manager was very  capable of delivering the mission and respecting his authority to do so, staying with  the project to understand and concur on every major decision.  The project manager  knows what to do and does it, and the PI looks for insight into his or her decisions  and confirms them.

Analyze the impact of rotor blade stalling on longitudinal stability in high-speed forward flight.,"According to the provided information, rotor blade stalling has a significant impact on longitudinal stability in high-speed forward flight. The text states that during the performance tests, considerable flying was done at relatively high speeds, approaching the limits imposed by blade stalling. It was found that the machine tended to diverge in pitch, creating the impression of balancing on a ball, which was most troublesome when upward pitching occurred, as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling. This tendency to stall was accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration.

The text also mentions that the rotor-blade stalling on the power absorbed by a rotor was determined in flight, and the results showed that stalling materially reduces rotor efficiency before the operating limitations due to vibration and loss of control were reached. Additionally, the calculation of the operating conditions corresponding to an angle of attack of the retreating blade tip of approximately 12° was found to be a useful approach in determining the conditions for optimum performance of current rotors, as well as in limiting the applicability of theoretical treatments that omit allowances for stalling losses.

Overall, the information suggests that rotor blade stalling has a significant impact on longitudinal stability in high-speed forward flight, leading to reduced rotor efficiency, increased tendency to pitch up, and violent periodic stick forces and vibration. This highlights the importance of considering rotor blade stalling in the design and development of helicopters to ensure stable and efficient operation.","['665 Document 5-44 (a–b) Longitudinal Stability in Forward Flight: During the course of the performance tests, considerable flying was done at relatively high speeds, approaching the  limits imposed by blade stalling.  It was found quite difficult to hold steady conditions because of a strong tendency of the machine to diverge in pitch, creating the  impression of balancing on a ball.  This characteristic seemed far more pronounced  with some of the rotors tested than with others, but was always troublesome.  Upward  pitching was most troublesome as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling,  which added to the difficulties because it increased the tendency to pitch up and  was accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. ', 'Current efforts relate primarily to  clarification of rotor force and blade-flapping phenomena for the severe flight conditions brought about by the considerable increases in installed power which are  evident in new designs.  This work utilizes published numerical procedures, in conjunction with electronic computers and full-scale experimental setups.  Limitations of helicopter speed due to retreating blade stall have been largely  based on pilot reactions to roughness caused by the blade stall.  A technique has  been developed whereby the beginning of this blade stall can be detected readily  under high forward-speed conditions.  This is accomplished by monitoring blade- pitching moments and power input so that blade stall can occur to a measurable  but not catastrophic degree.  As a consequence, it has been possible to establish the  allowable increase in forward speed for a rotor of a tandem helicopter resulting  from a change in blade-section from a symmetrical to a cambered section.  A 20- to  25-percent increase in forward speed at the same weight or a 15-percent increase in  gross weight appears possible. ', 'The experimental and analytical investigations of the fundamental factors that  affect the performance, flying qualities, and reliability of helicopters have been  continued during the past year.  The object of this work was to provide and interpret  the fundamental information required for proper guidance of helicopter development so that the unique potentialities of rotary-wing aircraft might be fully realized  in rescue, commercial, and military applications.  FLIGHT INVESTIGATIONS The effect of rotor-blade stalling on the power absorbed by a rotor was determined in flight and the results of the investigation published in Technical Note  1250.  The flight measurements checked the calculations made by the weighting  curve method in that it was found that stalling materially reduces rotor efficiency  before the operating limitations due to vibration and loss of control were reached.   It was also found that calculation of the operating conditions corresponding to an  angle of attack of the retreating blade tip of approximately 12° is a useful approach  in determining the conditions for optimum performance of current rotors, as well  as in limiting the applicability of theoretical treatments that omit allowances for  stalling losses.  Safety and design considerations make the autorotative condition important  to the helicopter designer inasmuch as the helicopter rotor becomes, in effect, an  autogiro rotor in the event of power failure.  Flight tests were therefore conducted  on a helicopter in the autorotative condition and the results published in Technical  Note 1267. ', '719 Document 5-47 (a–b) interference effects are not herein considered further, although they may have a  considerable effect on stability and control in particular cases.  It may be shown, exactly in the case of a flapping- or teetering-type lifting rotor  at zero air speed and approximately for such a rotor in forward flight, that a steady  pitching angular velocity of the hub will produce lateral flapping b subscript 1 = negative p omega over omega equals negative p1b su\u2009bscript 1 = negative p omega over omega equals negative ppω ω b subscript 1 = negative p omega over omega equals negative pb subscript 1 = negative p omega over omega equals negative p due to aerodynamic damping of the pitching motion and will produce longitudinal  flapping due to blade mass whose magnitude is dependent on the ratio of blade  moment of inertia about the flapping hinge to air density and which, for typical  rotor blades, is approximately a1 = −2.5p These values should still be good approximations for flapping due to hub pitching velocity during the conversion process.  For an angular motion of 90° in 15 sec.,  about 0.10 rad.  per sec., and a typical rotor speed ω = 25 rad.  per sec., the resultant  flapping amplitude would be √a1 2 + b1 2the square root of a 1 squared + b 1 squared = 2.7 p = 0.011 rad.

', 'NASA Earth science missions became controversial as  they were gradually pulled into the debate over environmental change, especially questions of climate change.  The George H. W. Bush administration  sought to build a large-scale program in 1991 called Mission to Planet Earth,  involving flying multiple missions to assess various facets of Earth’s environment.  Pursuing this initiative—“dedicated to understanding the total  Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on the  global environment”33—meant pushing off any need to take a position that  might adversely affect the President’s position within the Republican Party  while providing political cover at that year’s United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro.34 By 2001, NASA had returned to its former situation of budget overruns  in the human spaceflight program, and the bow wave had become too large  to be ignored.  The George W. Bush administration reacted by cutting ISS  funding again, this time by eliminating a crew return vehicle; canceling the  joint NASA-DOD X-33 and X-34 next-generation launch vehicle programs;  and further reducing ISS capabilities.  NASA’s ISS partners rejected the latter decision since the reduction would mean that their research modules  would never be flown to the ISS and employed for research.  Matters came  to a head on 1 February 2003, when the orbiter Columbia broke up during  reentry, killing seven crewmembers.  The Space Shuttle Program entered its  final stages as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board stated that the  Shuttle was an experimental vehicle whose continued flight was problematic.  ']","The Space Shuttle program's hiatus, resulting from the Columbia accident in 2003, reduced the ISS crew to two members, a skeleton workforce, and limited access to the Station to only the Russian Soyuz capsule, until the Shuttle resumed operations in 2006."

Analyze the impact of budget constraints on NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions.,"The budget constraints have a significant impact on NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions. The Agency's leadership has historically defined itself as underfunded, and the space science community has advocated for a budget of 1% of the federal budget to sustain a robust space program. However, this is an overly optimistic perspective, and the reality is that NASA's budget is finite and subject to fluctuations.

The budget constraints lead to sharp controversies over the rate and size of spaceflight funding, and the space science community is often taxed to support more important human spaceflight endeavors. The Agency's leadership has sought presidential engagement to initiate and fund human spaceflight projects, but this approach has proven to be a weak reed to rely on given other presidential priorities.

The budget constraints also make planning and implementation of space science missions difficult, and continuing constraints on NASA's budget raise the prospect of severe disruption of research across all space science disciplines. The Agency's priorities are influenced by national priorities, and the level of funding allocated to solar system exploration is a reflection of the relative standing of national priorities.

In conclusion, the budget constraints have a significant impact on NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions, leading to controversies over funding, prioritization, and the allocation of resources. The Agency's leadership and the space science community must navigate these challenges to ensure the continued success of NASA's mission.","['37 CHAPTER 2\u2002 •\u2002 Funding Planetary Science: History And Political Economy  can place a significant burden on limited resources.  As figure 1 clearly demonstrates, NASA has not encountered a budgetary environment quite like  this before.  One fundamental function of government is the allocation of resources,  and one of the clearest indications of national priorities is the level to which  they are funded.  Nearly every resource that is not money still costs money.   Therefore, examining the fluctuation of funding levels in a government budget can shed light on the relative standing of national priorities. ', 'Since the Apollo program, NASA  has chronically defined itself as underfunded.  For years, advocates for NASA  have cited 1 percent of the federal budget as a necessary goal in order to sustain a robust space program.  This is an overly optimistic perspective, based  on what is now clearly a historical anomaly—the early years of the Apollo  program (1964–67), when NASA’s budget accounted for around 4 percent of  the federal budget.10 The spaceflight community works to ensure that funding and commitments are supported in Congress and the executive branch to continue  specific flight vehicles such as the Space Shuttle and various attempts at a  successor.  Given that NASA budgets are finite, sharp controversies occur  over the rate and size of spaceflight funding.  In times of need, the space science community is, in effect, taxed to support the more important—according to Agency leadership—human spaceflight endeavors.  The latter can draw  in Congress as members act to protect constituent interests in protecting  jobs and companies.  NASA leadership has sought presidential engagement  to initiate and fund human spaceflight projects, but this approach has proven  repeatedly to be a weak reed to rely on given other presidential priorities.  ', '50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES 36 a minor fraction of the federal budget, which itself is a relatively small part  of the U.S.  economy, factors determining the allocation of resources to solar  system exploration are not always within the control of Agency leadership or  the science community.  Understanding NASA’s place in the U.S.  economic  environment helps explain some of the perennial turmoil that typically surrounds the annual budget process.  It also sheds light on the influence of  national priorities, an important factor to consider as the planetary science  community tries to convey the necessity of a continuing solar system exploration program.  This chapter considers planetary science in the context of  the federal budget, other federal research and development activities, and  other space science activities at NASA.  This chapter also analyzes the history of the U.S. ', 'In December  2010, agreement was reached that the SLS would proceed while the commercial sector would be challenged, with government support, to handle  crew and payload launches to the ISS and LEO.  Commercial crew and cargo  service is now underway.  For space science missions of any type, the federal deficit plus political  antagonisms make planning and implementation difficult.  Continuing constraints on NASA’s budget raise the prospect of severe disruption of research  across all space science disciplines.   WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  Space science is clearly an important part of NASA’s mission, but it cannot  be the Agency’s top priority given the hold that human spaceflight has on  NASA leadership and the public.  Space science is a public good, while human  exploration is said to be more than that—an expression of the human spirit,  according to some views. ']","Budget constraints significantly impacted NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions, as seen in the Dawn mission's cancellation and subsequent reinstatement. The cost of the mission was high, with $284 million already spent, and unresolved technical and management issues threatened to increase it further. This led to the cancellation, with rumors of funds being diverted to other projects, such as the space shuttle and space station."
"How did the collaborative efforts of the project manager and PI mitigate the mass, power, and budget problems threatening the mission?","The collaborative efforts of the project manager and PI mitigated the mass, power, and budget problems threatening the mission by:

1.  **Establishing a champion**: The PI was established outside of the existing engineering structure, giving them the power to redirect the project back on track as necessary.
2. **Checks and balances**: The project managers recognized the importance of the PI's approval before spending reserve funds, introducing checks and balances into the system.
3. **Delegation**: The PI delegated contract management, cost and technical oversight, and mission planning to the project manager and implementing organization, freeing them to focus on their own science and public engagement.
4. **Effective communication**: The PI and project manager worked closely together, with the PI asking the right questions, keeping abreast of developments, and being onsite as necessary.
5. **Trust and freedom**: The project manager was given the freedom to get the job done, with the PI trusting them to make decisions and manage the project effectively.

These collaborative efforts helped to mitigate the mass, power, and budget problems threatening the mission, ultimately leading to the success of the spacecraft and spectacular science.","['During this time, Deep Impact, largely built by an engineering team in Colorado  with a West Coast project manager and an East Coast PI, suffered from insufficient  oversight of subcontractors.  This problem deteriorated to the crisis point, requiring  replacement of the project manager and a change in management style.  The PI began  spending increased amounts of time onsite with the prime contractor, getting to know  its engineering culture and inviting informal questions in the hallway.  Once the PI  took these steps and the new project manager spent more time onsite managing the  prime contractor and checking on the progress of subcontractors, the project turned  around and delivered a successful spacecraft and spectacular science.  In the case of MESSENGER, technical challenges such as late deliveries coincided  with an unexpected change in project management as the original project manager  retired and his deputy disappeared, not returning to work after a particularly challenging trip to an underperforming subcontractor.  The implementing organization  was left scrambling, and the new project manager began a fresh costing effort that  determined that the mission was in far greater trouble than imagined.  This manager  worked closely with the PI and NASA management to bring the mission back on  track, and, after several infusions of additional funding, it went on to become one of  NASA’s greatest successes. ', 'Science benefits when a champion is established outside of the existing engineering  structure that has the power to redirect the project back on track as necessary.  The  project managers recognized this, even writing protection clauses into proposals that  required the PI’s approval before the spending of one penny of reserve.  These gates  introduced checks and balances into the system, reducing the possibility that engineering  overruns would erode the science return without careful consideration and approval  by the primary science stakeholder.  The interjection of a PI at this point in the system  caused the project managers to think twice about cutting the science budget and to  resist such cuts if pressured, even directed, by their own line or center management.  Project managers who have worked with multiple Discovery PIs spoke highly of  all of them, contrasting their different styles.  One gave the project manager the freedom he needed to get the job done.  Others were more hands-on in the day-to-day  development. ', 'He understood the engineering  enough, as the first project manager put it, that he felt it best to delegate its management and trust that he would be consulted on tough issues.  Both project managers  appreciated that, cajoling him occasionally to join them at certain meetings or travel to  the implementing organization to review progress.  The second project manager spoke  just as highly of him as the first, calling him a gem who gave the project manager all  the freedom he needed to get the job done.  By delegating the contract management,  cost and technical oversight, and mission planning to the project manager and his  implementing organization, the PI was free to keep working on his own science, to  serve on community panels, to give public talks, and to do interviews in support of  the mission.  He sparked interest in the mission by being present in another way—not  at the engineering level, but at the level of public engagement.  11 \t Niebur, S.  (2011, 19 March). ', 'Chapter 9: Insights from Discovery 363 On MESSENGER, the PI was deeply involved in the implementation of the mission,  asking the right questions, keeping abreast of developments, and being onsite as necessary.  The project manager for most of the development called him a first-class scientist,  very knowledgeable about the current status of development and cognizant of others’  roles as well.  On cost and technical issues, the PI stood back to let the engineering  team get the job done, an approach the project manager praised effusively.  Since the  PI could not be onsite every minute, the institution relied on an experienced project  scientist for day-to-day oversight of the science and nuances in the written requirements.  The MESSENGER team was not the only one to employ a project scientist or  team member at the project manager’s institution, but it was one of the most visible.  The Deep Impact PI was praised by the project manager who got the mission to  the launch pad.

Explore the application of space-derived cardiovascular monitoring technologies in predicting and preventing motor vehicle accidents.,"The application of space-derived cardiovascular monitoring technologies in predicting and preventing motor vehicle accidents is explored in the context of the Puls and Pneumocard experiments conducted on the International Space Station (ISS). These experiments aimed to study spaceflight effects on the cardiovascular system, which led to the development of unique instruments that can be used on Earth for the detection of the earliest deviations in health status.

The Ecosan-2007 complex, a multipurpose instrument for early detection of the earliest deviations in health status, is based on the principle of prenosological diagnosis. This device is now used to examine motor vehicle drivers, civil aviation pilots, and test subjects in experiments on Earth involving various stress factors. A study that used the Ecosan-2007 to detect early health issues among 105 bus drivers showed that more than 30% of the drivers were in prenosological and premorbid states, which sharply increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents.

The use of Ecosan-2007 showed that long-term, work-related chronic stress increases the risk development of pathologies, which should be considered during the expert evaluation of fitness for flight, especially for people over the age of 50. The Ecosan-2007 complex was also used in a 520-day experiment on Earth that simulated a flight to Mars.

These technologies have been successfully used to evaluate the body’s functional reserves, determine the degree of stress on regulatory systems, and assess the risk of development of disease, which can help prevent motor vehicle accidents. The use of these technologies can also help identify individuals who are at a higher risk of developing pathologies, which can be used to develop targeted interventions to prevent accidents. Overall, the application of space-derived cardiovascular monitoring technologies has the potential to significantly improve road safety and reduce the risk of motor vehicle accidents.","['165 Heart Health and Biorhythms Studying spaceflight effects on the cardiovascular system has led to the creation of unique  instruments that can be used on Earth for the detection of the earliest deviations in health status.

Twenty-four-hour electrocardiograms of astronauts were also analyzed to  understand the space environment’s effect on biological rhythm and cardiac autonomic nervous activity,  which led to recommendations for maintaining a well-balanced biological rhythm on Earth.  One of  these recommendations is maintenance of a regular sleep schedule.

Investigate the effects of microgravity on plant growth and gene expression in space-based experiments.,"The effects of microgravity on plant growth and gene expression have been studied in several space-based experiments.  For example, the Advanced Astroculture (ADVASC) investigation explored the benefits of using microgravity to create custom crops that can withstand the inhospitable climates of space, can resist pestilence, and will need less volume in which to grow.  The experiment grew two generations of Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean plants from seed to seed in space using the ADVASC payload—an autonomously operated plant growth unit.

In another experiment, scientists observed that circumnutation—a circular movement of growing stem—was a result of interplay between the plant’s own internal signals, gravity, and light—not just gravity alone, as had been theorized.  The unique environment of the space station allowed these experiments to be developed where gravity could be an independent, changeable variable, unlike on Earth.

Studies of Arabidopsis showed that the patterns of root waving and skewing during sprouting are similar on Earth as they are in space, demonstrating for the first time that gravity is not a significant factor for these patterns of root growth.  Images also revealed that in the absence of gravity with the presence of directional light, roots grew by skewing to the right, as opposed to growing straight down, away from the light source.

Investigations were also conducted to determine the gravity perception thresholds of plants when grown under various gravitational levels on the centrifuge on the space station.  Another study found that spaceflight activates lipotoxic pathways in mouse liver.

These experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of microgravity for plant growth and gene expression, and highlight the importance of understanding the effects of gravity on plant life in preparing for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit.

', 'One such experiment made unique observations to  attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of  circumnutation—a circular movement of growing stem  first described by Charles Darwin in 19th century.   The unique environment of the space station allowed  these experiments to be developed where gravity  could be an independent, changeable variable,  unlike on Earth.  As a result, scientists observed that  circumnutation is a result of interplay between the  plant’s own internal signals, gravity and light—not just  gravity alone, as had been theorized (Johnsson et al.,  2009; Solheim et al., 2009).  Studies of arabidopsis  showed that the patterns of root waving and skewing  during sprouting are similar on Earth as they are in  space, demonstrating for the first time that gravity  is not a significant factor for these patterns of root  growth.  Images also revealed that in the absence of  gravity with the presence of directional light, roots  grew by skewing to the right, as opposed to growing  straight down, away from the light source (Amalfitano  et al., 2012).

Over the  program, Orbital had two different program managers—Robert E. Lindberg,  Jr.  (also Orbital vice president and X-34 program principal investigator), and  G.

Industry has already proposed over 25 technology experiments  to be flown on the X-34, and NASA has selected seven for flight,  including two international experiments.

Requests came from seven different U.S.   companies, two NASA Centers, and two foreign companies.

The  overarching intent remained the same as in the first X-34 program—namely,  to reduce the cost of access to space from $10,000 per pound of payload to  $1,000 per pound of payload.  Announcement NRA 8-14 called for testing  key technologies “by building a test bed technology demonstration vehicle,  as well as providing RLV technology flight experiments.” The X-34 effort was  to be an accelerated fixed-budget program; innovative ideas are sought in all  areas of research to enable meaningful technology demonstrations within the  limited budget and schedule constraints.” The announcement also contained  an option/renewal provision, which was subsequently awarded for additional  flight test demonstrations “averaging 2 per month over a period of 1 year after  completion of the initial test flights.” Finally, the announcement identified  the “expected program funding” at $60 million [$92 million in 2016] for  the vehicle portion and an additional $2 million [$3 million in 2016] for the  experiments.

MITIS ON THE MOON areas deep beneath the Martian surface—the NRC recommended taking  special precautions.70 With Curiosity, NASA’s first astrobiology laboratory on Mars, seeking  evidence of past or present habitability on the planet, questions will continue  to arise, from the press and the public and the science community, about the  possibility of finding life on Mars or in other extraterrestrial environments.   With all the terrestrial junk that the U.S.  and Soviet/Russian space agencies have deposited on Mars—on purpose and by accident—since the 1970s,  some skeptics have raised the question of whether the planet may already be  contaminated with Earth life.71  For planetary protection, the story of S. mitis on the Moon illustrates,  among other things, that microbes are everywhere (on Earth), cleanroom  procedures for microbial assays cannot be too careful, and meticulous and  complete records of such procedures must be made and preserved.  For the  history and sociology of science, this case shows how a claim that was never  subjected to formal peer review and became, and remained, a fact for decades  before it was seriously challenged; and how it took visual evidence to finally  make the case that multiple sources had made verbally.

Explanation: The text mentions that the passengers’ deck is divided into eleven sections. There is no other mention of sections in the provided text. Therefore, the total number of sections listed on this page is 11.","['Based, in part, on the provisions for the crew and on the ease of inspection and  maintenance, we conclude that the second requirement for efficiency of operations  is fulfilled.  We now come to our third design criteria [sic] and, naturally, the one which  most concerns the traffic departments: the passenger accommodations.  The design  problem was to provide passenger accommodations which embodied unprecedented comfort, spaciousness, and luxury at reasonable weight and cost.  The passengers’ deck is divided into eleven sections: five standard compartments seating ten and sleeping six, one special compartment seating four and sleeping two, one deluxe compartment seating six and sleeping two, and a dining salon  seating fourteen at five tables, a galley, a dressing room for men, a dressing room for  the ladies, and three toilet compartments.  Thus, for this standard arrangement, seventy-four passengers can be seated in  the daytime, at night thirty-four berths may be set up, still leaving fourteen seats  ', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 834 TEST RESULTS Figure 3 [not reproduced] depicts the airfoils that were tested and indicates  their respective region of applicability on the blade.  It should be noted that for each  radial station there were several candidate sections.  This was done to facilitate a  “fly-off” between the best candidate sections.  Therefore, actual test data could be  used to determine the best airfoil for each category.  Cross plots of the wind-tunnel data for the candidate sections were generated,  and a thorough evaluation of the measured performance was carried out. ', 'These goals are shown in Table 1 (Reference 3).   Two design constraints were placed on the airfoil designs.  These were the thickness  ratios and the pitching moment coefficients, which were constrained by dynamic  frequency placement and control system loads.  Four airfoil sections were developed  for the 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 blade radial stations.  They were developed using the  BHTI Aerodynamic Design and Analysis Methodology (ADAM) (Reference 4).   A subsonic inverse design process, which is one of the options in the ADAM system, was used to design the airfoil sections.  Numerous design iterations were performed with ADAM to optimize the performance at the critical design points. ', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 836 SUMMARY Figures 11, 12, 13, and 14 [not reproduced] give a summary of the results of the  new airfoils compared to the existing XV-15 airfoils and the design goals.  The maximum lift as a function of the radial station where each section applies  is shown in Figure 11.  In this figure, a curve is faired between the results for the  airfoils for the existing, design goal, and realized maximum lift coefficient at a  retreating blade condition.  It indicates that the new sections provide a substantial  increase in the maximum lift capability over the 6-series sections.  This was the first  priority goal.  The second priority was to maintain the low-drag characteristics of the existing  6-series airfoils at the cruise Mach number and local lift coefficient.  Figure 12 gives  the drag of the existing section (which was the desired level) and the drag of the  advanced technology sections at this condition. ']",3
"What changes did the Bush administration, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, implement at NASA through Daniel Goldin's appointment?","The Bush administration, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, implemented changes at NASA through Daniel Goldin's appointment by replacing Administrator Richard Truly with Goldin. Goldin was tasked with changing NASA's space exploration culture from the top down. He implemented a Discovery program, which would solicit proposals for small, cost-capped missions led by a Principal Investigator, and introduced the ""faster, better, cheaper"" (FBC) methods for managing missions. These changes aimed to make NASA less averse to risk and willing to abandon outdated methods and thinking. Goldin also promised to cancel any Discovery program mission that went over budget. Additionally, he oversaw the formation of a sustainable small-mission program, which the planetary science community had been trying to establish for over two decades.  Goldin's appointment and changes aimed to transform NASA's culture and approach to space exploration.  He was a proponent of horizontal management structures and projects executed under short time constraints, believing that longer schedules allowed design changes, which in turn caused budgets to grow.  Goldin's vision was to make NASA an organization less averse to risk and willing to abandon what he saw as outdated methods and thinking.  He was a change agent, and that was what President George H. W. Bush wanted.  He had fired Goldin's predecessor Richard Truly in part because he had not championed enthusiastically Bush's Moon-Mars human exploration initiative.  That was not a problem for Goldin, who was a proponent of robotic Mars exploration.  Goldin's appointment and changes had a significant impact on NASA's planetary science program, leading to the formation of a sustainable small-mission program and the introduction of FBC methods.  These changes aimed to make NASA more efficient and effective in its space exploration efforts.  Goldin's legacy at NASA is still remembered and studied today, and his changes had a lasting impact on the agency's approach to space exploration.  He was a visionary leader who transformed NASA's culture and approach to space exploration, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence the space community today.  Goldin's appointment and changes were a significant turning point in NASA's history, marking a shift towards a more efficient and effective approach to space exploration.  His legacy is a testament to the power of visionary leadership and the importance of adapting to changing circumstances.

With the Discovery program, Goldin oversaw the formation of what  the planetary science community had been trying to establish for over two  decades: a sustainable small-mission program.52 Faster, Better, Cheaper The methods Goldin wanted to implement for managing missions, adapted  from a series of small projects he had overseen at TRW Space and Technology  Group for the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, were characterized  as “faster, better, cheaper” (FBC) in a speech by Vice President Dan Quayle.53  FBC methods involved small, streamlined teams in which members had  expertise in several fields, so that no aspect of the project was isolated from  the rest of the team.  Projects run under FBC reduced layers of management  and oversight and launched within three years of project selection.  Goldin  promised to cancel any Discovery program mission that went over budget.54 In 1994, following on the astronomical community’s success with reports  conveying scientific priorities for a decade, the SSB’s COMPLEX released  An Integrated Strategy for the Planetary Sciences: 1995–2010,55 which evaluated NASA’s entire planetary science effort, established the most important  scientific goals of the field, and recommended a path forward for research.
