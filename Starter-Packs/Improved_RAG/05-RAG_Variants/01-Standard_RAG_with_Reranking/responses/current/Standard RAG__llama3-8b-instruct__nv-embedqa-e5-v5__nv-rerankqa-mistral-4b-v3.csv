They were also  the first attempt by humans to send spacecraft to  the vicinity of Mars. Although the spacecraft initially included a TV imaging system (similar to the  one carried on Luna 3), a UV spectrometer, and  a spectroreflectometer (to detect organic life on  Mars), mass constraints forced engineers to delete  these instruments a week before launch. A possibly apocryphal story has it that once removed from  the spacecraft, the spectroreflectometer was tested  not far from the Tyuratam launch site but failed  to detect any life. The spacecraft itself was a cylinder, about a meter in diameter with all the basic  systems required of interplanetary travel—a means  to regulate temperatures, batteries charged by solar  panels, a long-distance communication system,  three-axis stabilization, and a mid-course correction engine (the S5.9). The mission profile called  for the probe to first enter Earth orbit and then  use a new fourth stage (called “Blok L”) capable of  firing in vacuum, to gain enough additional velocity  for a Mars encounter.

N1  development began in 1962 after two years of initial R&D on heavy booster designs. Although the  first launch had been originally planned for 1965, a  major redesign of the booster in 1964 and financial  and organizational difficulties delayed the launch  by four years. The Soviet Communist Party and  government officially sanctioned the human lunar  landing program in August 1964, more than three  years after President John F. Kennedy’s famous  speech calling on the United States to land an  American on the Moon before the end of the  1960s. Development of both the N1 rocket and the  L3 payload was plagued by many delays. On this  first launch, the N1 carried a basic 7K-L1 spacecraft modified for operations in lunar orbit (rather  than for circumlunar flight). Known as the 7K-L1S,  the spacecraft was equipped with an Engine Orientation Complex (DOK) for attitude control in lunar  orbit.

The basic Ye-8 comprised a lander stage (the “KT”) topped off by an  eight-wheeled remote-controlled lunar rover (the  “8YeL”) for exploring the Moon’s surface. Essentially a pressurized magnesium alloy container on  wheels, the 8YeL was designed to operate over a  period of three lunar days (i.e., roughly three Earth  months) and collect scientific data from various  points on the lunar surface. This first attempt to  put the rover on the Moon was a complete failure.  At T+51.42 seconds, the payload stack disintegrated and the booster exploded at T+54 seconds.  Debris landed about 15 kilometers from the launch  site. Later investigation indicated that maximum  dynamic pressure during the ascent trajectory tore  the new and untested payload shroud off at its  weakest tension points. Despite an intensive effort,  searchers were unable to find the polonium-210  radioactive isotope heat source in the rover.', 'On this mission, engineers redesigned the problematic I-100 control system that had caused most  of the previous failures. Previously the I-100 unit  had controlled both the Blok L upper stage and the  spacecraft itself. On this mission (and subsequent  Lunas), the fourth stage and the Ye-6 spacecraft had  separate systems. Unfortunately, this probe never  reached Earth orbit. During the launch, depressurization of a nitrogen pipe for the liquid oxygen tank  on the third stage (Blok I) prevented third stage  engine ignition. The spacecraft thus broke up over  the Pacific without reaching Earth orbit. 55 Luna 5 Nation: USSR (32) Objective(s): lunar soft-landing Spacecraft: Ye-6 (no. 10) Spacecraft Mass: 1,476 kg Mission Design and Management: OKB-1 Launch Vehicle: Molniya-M + Blok L (8K78M no.

What is the function of the main longitudinal strength member in a seaplane's float?,"The main longitudinal strength member in a seaplane's float is the keel. It is the area included between the chines and the keel from below to the stern. The keel is a critical component of the float, as it provides the main longitudinal strength and helps to maintain the float's stability and buoyancy. It is also responsible for supporting the weight of the seaplane and helping to distribute the forces acting on the float during takeoff and landing. The keel is typically located at the bottom of the float and runs along its length, providing a strong and rigid structure that helps to maintain the float's shape and stability. In addition to its structural function, the keel also plays a role in the float's hydrodynamic performance, as it helps to reduce drag and improve the float's ability to plane and lift off the water. Overall, the keel is a critical component of the seaplane's float, and its design and construction are critical to the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft.","['263 Document 5-20 (a–c) At the time his text was published, Nelson also served as a lecturer in the  Guggenheim-sponsored aeronautics program at New York University. He later became  a commander with responsibilities at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia. The final selection is a chapter on flying boat hull design from Marcus Langley’s  1935 text, Seaplane Float and Hull Design. Little is known about the author other  than that he was a British aeronautical engineer with a degree in naval architecture who served at the time of this publication as an “Instructor in Design” at the  De Havilland Aeronautical Technical School in England. Besides this textbook, he  also authored a book titled Metal Aircraft Construction: A Review for Aeronautical  Engineers of the Modern International Practice in Metal Construction of Aircraft, also  published by London’s Pitman & Sons earlier in the 1930s.

The naval architect describes floats with a number of technical words and  phrases peculiar to his profession. For the benefit of the student and engineer who  is unfamiliar with these terms, a short list of definitions has been prepared, limited  to the most frequently used words and phrases. Afterbody. That part of a float between the main step and the stern. Bottom. The area included between chines and keel from below to stern. Bow. The extreme forward point, or portion of a float. Buoyancy. The displacement (in lbs. of sea water) to a given water line. Buoyancy, center of. The center of gravity of the displaced volume of water. Buoyancy, excess. The difference between the total or submerged and normal or  load water line displacements. Usually expressed as a percentage of the normal  displacement.

Equation 185 Transverse stability—single floats and flying boats. Single float seaplanes  and flying boats require the use of auxiliary floats on the wing tips in order to  secure transverse stability. The usual method is to install the tip floats so that at  normal trim and draft they clear the water from 3 in. to 8 in. according to the span,  and make the volume large enough to give a righting moment which is greater than  twice the upsetting moment when one float is just submerged. The equation of moments about the c.b.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 308 could be improved by changing its form to give a longer and flatter forebody. A new  forebody was made and tested with the original afterbody, and the improved model  equals in performance the best flying-boat hull. Tests of two models, nos. 11 and  11A, are described in Technical Notes Nos. 464 and 470. Observation of the behavior of the models of hulls tested suggested the possibility of improving performance by a radical change in the form of the main step. A  model was prepared in which the step was much deeper than usual and was pointed  in plan form instead of square across the hull. This model, no. 22, showed a general  performance much superior to the previous model. These results will be issued as  a technical note and it is hoped that a full-scale test of this form may be made to  determine its behavior under operating conditions. A model of a flying boat hull having one form of stub wings or sponsons to provide lateral stability was investigated. Other forms of sponsons have been made for  tests with the same main hull, and in view of the later development of this type of  lateral stabilization, it is planned to extend the application of hulls of other shapes. Floats for seaplanes.—In order to obtain information regarding the performance  of a good high-speed seaplane float, tests were made of a model of a float used on  the Macchi racer 1926. As a result of the tests a float designed to be an improvement of this float and to be used as a parent of future series was tested. This model  showed a marked improvement over the Macchi float. The results of the two tests  are compared in Technical Note No. 473. Fundamental information regarding planing surfaces.—For a large part of the  take-off run of the seaplane, that part of the weight of the craft not supported by  the wings is supported by the hydrodynamic reaction of the water on the bottom  of the float or boat.', 'It depends on the wing and the wing  area. It depends on the power available and also upon the control that can be  exerted over the forces extant. Aerodynamic considerations and performance of  the seaplane in the air govern most seaplane features other than the float and its  position. A good float has a low water resistance and is so situated that control over  its trim can be handled by the ailerons, wings, and elevators. It must not take off  before the seaplane has reached stalling speed, and it must not “porpoise” or stick  to the water. The limits to the take-off performance are fixed by the wing loading and the  power loading of the seaplane as a whole. Starting at rest, when the power is applied the seaplane is accelerated by the  propeller thrust. As this thrust overcomes the water resistance, the seaplane gains  velocity. Air resistance of the seaplane comes into play. Then, during the remainder  of the take-off, the thrust of the propeller in excess of the air resistance and the  water resistance tends to accelerate the seaplane until it takes off the water. Several  points are of special interest in this take-off. When the speed has reached about 40']","The main longitudinal strength member, known as the keel, provides continuous strength along the bottom and center line of a seaplane's float."

The Columbia accident of 1 February 2003, resulting in the deaths of seven  astronauts, grounded the Space Shuttle fleet and thereby placed on hold construction of the ISS. Access to the Station, thereafter, came only through the  use of the Russian Soyuz capsule, a reliable but limited vehicle whose technology extended back to the 1960s. Because of this limitation, the ISS crew was  cut to two members in May 2003, a skeleton workforce designed to keep the  Station operational. When the Space Shuttle resumed operations in 2006, efforts to complete  the ISS took a more aggressive turn. In all, between 1998 and 2011, NASA  and the Russian Space Agency made 40 assembly flights for the ISS. Thirty- four of those assembly flights were completed by astronauts aboard Space  Shuttle missions.  Figure 10-3.

The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) found that at approximately 81 seconds after a 10:39 a.m. EST launch on 16 January 2003, foam  from the external tank left bipod ramp area impacted Columbia in the vicinity  of the lower left-wing reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC). During reentry on the  morning of 1 February 2003, superheated gases entered Columbia’s left wing  where holes existed, destroying the aluminum superstructure. The spacecraft  broke up, and the entire crew perished in the accident.  Again, NASA grounded the Shuttle fleet, worked to understand the technical problems, made repairs, and returned to flight in May 2006. Meantime, the  President directed in January 2004 that the space station would be completed,  and the Space Shuttle retired. NASA would then move on to another vehicle  for orbital and deep space exploration. In the end, the Space Shuttle flew several  additional missions, serviced the Hubble Space Telescope, and ceased operations in 2011.  Legacies When assessing the 30-year history of the Space Shuttle’s operational life, one  must first acknowledge that it was an important symbol of the United States’  technological capability, universally recognized as such by both the American  people and the larger international community. NASA’s Space Shuttle remains  after two and a half decades one of the most highly visible symbols of American  technological capability worldwide. Even critics of the program, such as journalist Greg Easterbrook, acknowledge this. As he wrote in Time just after the  Columbia accident: A spacecraft is a metaphor of national inspiration: majestic, technologically  advanced, produced at dear cost and entrusted with precious cargo, rising above  the constraints of the earth. The spacecraft carries our secret hope that there is  something better out there—a world where we may someday go and leave the sorrows of the past behind.', 'Chapter 8:\u2002 Achieving Reusable Space Access  155 feature in case it was ever needed, but every time it would stress the technology  and had to be tracked carefully, hence the six times limitation. This was a very  tall order, and the R&D required to build this engine cost more, and took more  time, than envisioned. Likewise, the orbiter’s thermal protection system (TPS),  which also had to be reusable, proved difficult. NASA had to develop a special  heat resistant ceramic tile to be placed on the underside and nose of the orbiter  Figure 8-2. The best view of a Space Shuttle launch is just after liftoff, as it clears the tower.  On 3 October 1988, STS-26 marked the return to flight for the Space Shuttle after the tragic  Challenger accident of 27 January 1986.

It was a close-run thing, but the crew returned safely on 17 April 1970.  The near disaster served several important purposes for the civil space program,  especially prompting reconsideration of the propriety of the whole effort while  also solidifying in the popular mind NASA’s technological genius, since they  were able to bring the crew back alive. The third critical piece of hardware for Apollo was the Lunar Module (LM).  Begun a year later than it should have been in 1962, the LM was consistently  behind schedule and over budget. Nicknamed “Spider” because of its spindly  legs, much of the LM’s problem turned on the demands of devising two separate spacecraft components—one for descent to the Moon and one for ascent  back to the Command Module—that only maneuvered outside an atmosphere.  Both engines had to work perfectly, or the very real possibility existed that the  astronauts would not return home. Guidance, maneuverability, and spacecraft  control also caused no end of headaches. The landing structure likewise presented problems; it had to be light and sturdy and shock resistant. An ungainly  vehicle emerged, which two astronauts could fly while standing. In November  1962 Grumman Aerospace Corp. signed a contract with NASA to produce the  LM, and work on it began in earnest. With difficulty, the LM was orbited on a  Saturn V test launch in January 1968 and judged ready for operation. The LM proved its mettle during the first two piloted test flights and  the landings of the first two Apollo missions on the lunar surface.']",The Russian Soyuz capsule.
Compare the management styles and priorities of Daniel Goldin and Administrator Truly at NASA.,"Daniel Goldin and Richard Truly had different management styles and priorities at NASA. Goldin was known for being intense, even intimidating, in style; visionary; and hard-working. He called himself a change agent, and that was what President George H. W. Bush wanted. He was a proponent of horizontal management structures and projects executed under short time constraints, believing that longer schedules allowed design changes, which in turn caused budgets to grow. Goldin's management style was focused on ""faster, better, cheaper"" and he aimed to reverse the trend of science missions growing larger and more expensive. He implemented a more balanced aeronautics and space program by reducing human space flight funding and increasing funding for science and aerospace technology.

On the other hand, Administrator Truly was not the man to initiate changes at NASA. He was not a proponent of the ""faster, better, cheaper"" approach and was not willing to abandon what he saw as outdated methods and thinking. His management style was more traditional and focused on longer schedules and larger budgets.

In summary, Goldin's management style was more innovative and focused on cost-cutting and efficiency, while Truly's management style was more traditional and focused on longer schedules and larger budgets. Goldin's priorities were focused on ""faster, better, cheaper"" and a more balanced aeronautics and space program, while Truly's priorities were focused on maintaining the status quo and not making significant changes to NASA's programs and operations.","['There he  rose through the ranks and was Vice President and General Manager for  Space when called to Washington.

The Bush administration’s National Space Council, led by Vice President  Dan Quayle, concluded that Administrator Truly was not the man to initiate  changes at NASA. His replacement, in what would be the last year of the Bush  administration, was a rising star from the defense side of the U.S. space program named Daniel Goldin. Goldin caught the attention of Quayle and the  National Space Council through his work with the Strategic Defense Initiative  Organization on short-schedule, low-cost space technology demonstration  projects. Goldin was a proponent of horizontal management structures and  projects executed under short time constraints, believing that longer schedules allowed design changes, which in turn caused budgets to grow.  In 1992, President George H. W. Bush chose Goldin as the new NASA  Administrator and tasked him with the mission of changing NASA’s space  exploration culture from the top down. Goldin came to NASA intent on shaping it into an organization less averse to risk and willing to abandon what he  saw as outdated methods and thinking. In NASA’s Planetary Exploration  Division, Goldin accepted plans to implement a Discovery program, which  would solicit proposals for small, cost-capped missions led by a Principal  Investigator, rather than having mission science parameters determined by', 'Promise Denied 36 higher costs, and all at a time when the Agency was facing arguably the most  serious funding stringencies and management challenges of its history. Under  Dan Goldin, space historian and policy analyst Howard E. McCurdy, noted,  “‘[f]aster, better, cheaper’ became the primary means of testing whether alternatives to formal systems management could be made to work.”8 The change in  management techniques—emphasizing, as McCurdy put it, the “dynamics that  arise in small, cohesive project teams” (such as Lockheed’s legendary “Skunk  Works”)—started a controversy within the Agency that lasted throughout the  time period of the initiative and well beyond as well.9 Having decided to boldly go where no Agency administrator had gone  before, Goldin was undeterred by any naysayers and enthusiastically embarked  upon his “faster, better, cheaper” quest.10 Commenting in 1995 on the Agency’s  experience over the previous two years of pursuing this new way of doing business with a significantly reduced budget, he stated: The accomplishments we have made over the past two years to  reinvent our programs have allowed us to absorb significant cuts  in our budget. We have initiated the first steps by reducing our  five-year budget plan by 30 percent since 1993. Now we have  an opportunity to continue reinventing NASA as an institution,  which will result in even further savings to the American taxpayer  and help reduce the deficit for future generations…. The result  is a new blueprint for the future of our Agency. The plan we will  follow defines five areas that the Administration, the Congress,  and the American people have come to recognize as NASA’s mission. These strategic enterprises include: Mission to Planet Earth,  Aeronautics, Human Exploration and Development of Space,  Space Science, and Space Technology. With these programs as a  foundation, we now enter the second phase of reinventing NASA.  This means we’re going to revolutionize the structure of NASA— our workers, our relationship with contractors, and our facilities.', '101 CHAPTER 3\u2002 •\u2002 The Politics Of Pure Space Science, The Essential Tension  refurbishment and flight preparation. The objective of these changes was to  improve NASA’s control over human spaceflight spending and thus facilitate  other Agency activities, including space science and aeronautics, the latter  being particularly important to international competitiveness.  When the Mars Observer spacecraft, launched on a Titan III ELV, was lost  in 1993, NASA’s Mars program hit a dead end. There was no money available to fly another mission of similar profile, given that the Mars Observer  was a billion-dollar program. Mars Observer had been freed from the earlier  requirement of human rating, but the mission reflected the dominance that  requirement had over space science at the time. For space science missions, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin pushed  for a new approach called “faster, better, cheaper.” The goal of this approach  was to reverse the trend of science missions growing larger and more expensive, the abortive Mars Observer mission being one much-cited example.28 “Faster, better, cheaper” science mission programs initiated at NASA  included the Discovery program in 1992, the New Millennium program in  1995, an expanded Mars exploration program with a mission planned every  two years, and the Origins program. According to NASA: Through Goldin’s aggressive management reforms, annual budgets have  been reduced, producing a $40 billion reduction from prior budget plans. He  implemented a more balanced aeronautics and space program by reducing  human space flight funding from 48 percent of NASA’s total budget to 38  percent and increasing funding for science and aerospace technology from  31 to 43 percent…. Goldin also cut the time required to develop Earth- and space-science spacecraft by 40 percent and reduced the cost by two-thirds, while increasing the  average number of missions launched per year about four times.']","Daniel Goldin favored horizontal management structures, short schedules, and low costs, whereas Administrator Truly's approach was not specified. Goldin aimed to reduce risk aversion and outdated methods, whereas Truly's priorities were not mentioned."
Analyze the role of end credits in documenting film production contributors.,"The role of end credits in documenting film production contributors is crucial. End credits provide a platform for acknowledging the contributions of various individuals and organizations involved in the production of a film. These credits include the names of the cast, crew, and production staff, as well as the companies and organizations that supported the production.

In the context of film production, end credits serve several purposes. Firstly, they provide a way to recognize the hard work and dedication of the cast and crew, who often work long hours and make significant sacrifices to bring the film to life. Secondly, end credits help to establish the film's credits and provide a sense of closure for the audience. Finally, end credits can also serve as a marketing tool, as they provide a way to promote the film and its contributors.

In the context of the provided text, the role of end credits is not explicitly mentioned. However, the text does provide information about the importance of acknowledging the contributions of various individuals and organizations involved in the production of a film. The text also highlights the significance of recognizing the hard work and dedication of the cast and crew, which is closely related to the role of end credits in documenting film production contributors.

In conclusion, the role of end credits in documenting film production contributors is essential. End credits provide a platform for acknowledging the contributions of various individuals and organizations involved in the production of a film, and they serve several purposes, including recognizing the hard work and dedication of the cast and crew, establishing the film's credits, and serving as a marketing tool.","['vi Acknowledgments Any author is in debt to many who help with the research and writing process.

"Compare the objectives and outcomes of Zond 7 with those of other Zond missions, such as Zond 5 and Zond 6.","Zond 7 was the first fully successful Soviet circumlunar mission. It carried a set of biological specimens, including four male steppe tortoises, and successfully circled the farside of the Moon. The spacecraft performed color imaging sessions on August 8 and 11.

Comparing the objectives and outcomes of Zond 7 with those of other Zond missions, such as Zond 5 and Zond 6, we can see that:

* Zond 5 was also a circumlunar flight mission, but it did not carry biological specimens. It carried a set of radiation detectors and an imaging system.
* Zond 6 was not a circumlunar flight mission. It was a lunar orbit mission that carried a set of biological specimens, including worms and insects, and a radiation detector.

In summary, Zond 7 was the first fully successful Soviet circumlunar mission that carried biological specimens and successfully circled the farside of the Moon.

For the long term, the research conducted to  solve the inlet-engine compatibility problems related to the F-111 proved  beneficial to the development of later American military aircraft, including the  Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics  F-16 Fighting Falcon, and Rockwell B-1 Lancer.28 Developing and Refining Advanced  Military Aircraft Engines The Military and NASA Lewis’s Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) Since its creation, NASA supported engine development for American aircraft.  In 1966, with much of the work on the Apollo program already accomplished,', 'Langley and Ames actively supported the development program in many areas, which amounted to the most  extensive wind tunnel support ever provided for one aircraft by NASA or the  NACA.23 Langley engineers were finding indications of problems with the  inlet, but these were a byproduct of their other work, and their concerns were  lost in the bureaucratic hustle that characterized the development of the F-111  in the 1963–1965 period. The staff at Lewis was fully engrossed in programs  supporting the space program and ballistic missile development.24 That changed, however, when the inlet-engine compatibility problems  arose. Immediately, NASA was asked to investigate the problem. In March  and April 1965, Ames conducted an investigation into the use of vortex generators, small fins used to control airflow, to minimize distortion in the F-111  supersonic inlet system. NASA researchers shared the results with General  Dynamics’ engineers, who left the meetings with detailed design drawings.  The F-111/TF-30 Propulsion Program Review Committee, with members  representing General Dynamics, Pratt & Whitney, the Air Force, and the Navy,', 'NASA Gets to Work, 1958–1975 61 as well as researchers from Ames and Lewis, met in September and October  1965 to discuss engine control problems, inlet distortion evaluation, engine  development, and an estimated stall-free envelope.25 The solution put forth by General Dynamics was the so-called Triple Plow I  inlet, which the Air Force approved for production in early 1967. The design  modified the splitter plate between the front of the intake and the fuselage to  divert turbulent boundary-layer air that hugged the fuselage, incorporated  hydraulically extended engine cowls, and integrated 20 vortex generators into  each inlet. Pratt & Whitney introduced a less-temperamental TF30 engine.  The modifications improved performance, but they still did not fully satisfy the  Air Force engineers in the F-111 Systems Program Office at the Aeronautical  Systems Division of Air Force Systems Command, located at Wright-Patterson  Air Force Base, OH. They worked through the late 1960s and offered a better  solution in the form of the Triple Plow II inlet, characterized by an enlarged  inlet duct and major structural changes. It provided a full-capability flight  Mach/maneuvering envelope free of compressor stalls.26 The final cost to fix  the inlet-engine compatibility problem was over $100 million.27 Only the Air Force’s F-111 went into service, beginning with the F-111A  in 1967, because the Navy’s variant, the F-111B, grew too heavy and was too  underpowered to fly from aircraft carriers and serve in the fleet air defense  role. After solving the structural problems, the Air Force went on to operate successive strike, strategic bomber, and electronic warfare versions of the  F-111 in Southeast Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East through 1998.  The strategic bomber variant, the FB-111A, flew into the 1990s.

Not surprisingly, the program proved to be seriously flawed; the Navy variant, the  F-111B, was so heavy that it never entered service, and the Air Force variant, the F-111A, was underpowered and proved unable to meet the original  performance requirement. Eventually, the F-111 design was made to work,  and the final F-111F “Aardvark” was a remarkably successful strike aircraft, as  exemplified by its performance in 1991 in the first Gulf War, together with an  electronic warfare variant, the EF-111A “Sparkvark.”General Dynamics F-111A (S/N 63-9773) in flight. (U.S. Air Force photo) Figure 2-5. NASA contributed greatly to improving the design of the General Dynamics  F-111A. (USAF) One of the challenges of the F-111 program was that it incorporated a  new innovation for American military aircraft: a variable-geometry, or swing,  wing. When fully extended, it facilitated short takeoffs and landings. When  fully swept, it enabled the F-111 to attain speeds of up to Mach 2.5, exceeding 920 mph at less than 200 feet altitude. The variable-sweep wing had first  appeared on the Bell X-5 research airplane, which the Air Force and the NACA  had extensively tested in the 1950s. Though attempted unsuccessfully on  Grumman’s XF10F-1 Jaguar naval fighter in the mid-1950s, the F-111 represented its first practical application. Other American and foreign swing wing  aircraft included the B-1 strategic bomber, the F-14 fighter, and the MiG-23.  From the beginning, a multitude of problems centered on making one airplane  meet the requirements of two services and their disparate missions beset the  TFX program, along with continuous technical challenges.

How do astronomers utilize a Super-Jupiter's cloudy skies and infrared brightness fluctuations to determine its rotation period?,"Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the Super-Jupiter, 2M1207b, and discovered that it has patchy clouds that appear to flicker as the planet spins. By measuring the fluctuations in the planet's brightness, they were able to determine its rotation period, which is approximately every 10 hours. This is similar to the rotation period of Jupiter. The cloudy skies and infrared brightness fluctuations allowed astronomers to observe the planet's rotation indirectly, as the planet's brightness changes rhythmically as it spins on its axis. This technique was used to measure the rotation rate of an exoplanet for the first time.","['Using a Super-Jupiter’s Cloudy Skies to Measure its  Rotation Rate  Measuring the length of a day on our neighboring world Mars was relatively “This result gives us a  simple  Using a telescope, Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens spotted a unique technique to dark splotch on the red planet’s surface and tracked how much time it took  for the feature to return to the same position  Around 350 years later, a team explore the atmospheres  of scientists used a similar method but a far more powerful instrument–– of exoplanets and the Hubble Space Telescope––to make the frst direct measurement of an  exoplanet’s rotation rate, thanks to its cloudy skies   measure their rotation  rates ” Astronomers previously used Hubble to observe the planet, dubbed  2M1207b, and discovered that it rains glass high in the atmosphere and  Daniel Apai, University of Arizona  molten iron at lower altitudes  The bizarre world is located about 170 light- years from Earth and orbits a brown dwarf––a so-called failed star, which is  not massive enough to power itself by nuclear fusion the way stars do  Since the brown dwarf is so dim and far from  the planet, astronomers more recently used Hubble to observe 2M1207b directly  The planet is so young that it is still  hot as it contracts under gravity, making it glow in infrared light  Using Hubble’s infrared vision, astronomers saw that  the planet rhythmically fickers as it spins on its axis like a top  The subtle changes in the planet’s brightness are likely  due to a variegated cloud cover of comparatively bright and dark patches   Based on their observations, astronomers estimate the gaseous world completes one rotation approximately every 10  hours, which happens to be nearly the same as Jupiter’s rotation rate  The James Webb Space Telescope will help  astronomers better determine 2M1207b’s atmospheric composition and derive detailed maps from brightness changes  with the new technique demonstrated by Hubble’s observations   This image shows the brown dwarf 2M1207A (left) and an orbiting planet,', 'This artist’s illustration features the super-Jupiter planet 2M1207b in the foreground and its parent brown dwarf in the background.

Thomas Beatty, Pennsylvania State University  Astronomers used Hubble to study the planet’s atmosphere in near-infrared  light as the world passed behind its star, an event called a secondary eclipse.  Observing the secondary eclipse allowed astronomers to gather the temperature of atmospheric components on the  planet’s day side. The researchers found the giant planet’s atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes––the opposite of  what they expected.  Hot Jupiters typically have a gaseous form of titanium oxide that absorbs light and heats the upper atmosphere.  Astronomers think high winds on Kepler-13Ab carry titanium oxide around to the permanently dark side of the planet,  where it condenses to form clouds and falls as flurries of titanium dioxide. The planet’s gravity is so strong that the  titanium dioxide can’t be recycled back into the upper atmosphere on the planet’s day side. Instead, it remains trapped  on the night side, leading astronomers to call this precipitation process a “cold trap.” These Hubble observations  marked the first time astronomers detected a cold trap on an exoplanet.  Kepler-13Ab looms large among some of the planets in our solar system in this illustration. Known as a hot Jupiter due to its size and proximity to its star, Kepler-13Ab  is one of the hottest known planets with a dayside temperature of nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.']","Astronomers use a Super-Jupiter's cloudy skies and infrared brightness fluctuations to determine its rotation period by observing the rhythmic changes in its brightness, likely due to variegated cloud cover, and estimating the time it takes to complete one rotation."
Compare the technological goals of the X-34 program with those of the DC-X and DC-XA programs.,"The X-34 program was designed to focus on low-cost, efficient turnaround operations, with a goal of a fast turnaround rate at a cost of less than $500,000 per flight. The X-34 was intended to be a reusable launch vehicle and experiment flight host, with a focus on reducing production fabrication costs. In contrast, the DC-X and DC-XA programs were designed to push the envelope in terms of advanced technologies, with the DC-XA aiming to investigate the application of a larger number of more advanced technologies. The DC-XA was also designed to fly more routinely than the X-34, with a focus on low-cost, efficient turnaround operations. The DC-X and DC-XA programs were also focused on developing reusable launch vehicles, but with a greater emphasis on advanced technologies and more ambitious goals. Overall, the X-34 program was designed to be a more incremental step towards reusable launch vehicles, while the DC-X and DC-XA programs were designed to be more revolutionary in their approach.","['Index 377 DC-X Program, 39 accomplishments, 41 compared to DC-XA Program, 42 compared to X-34 Renewed Program, 109,  130–132 DC-X Delta Clipper, 11, 24, 39–40 DC-X Delta Clipper Experimental, 36 DC-X Delta Clipper specifications, 40 lessons learned, 123, 131–132 NASA Program, 41 testing, 40–41 DC-XA Clipper Graham, 1, 5, 11, 24, 58n31 compared to X-34 Renewed Program,  130–132 fuel tanks, 106 lessons learned, 147 loss of, 43–45, 257 testing, 42–43 X-34 Program, 78 DC-XA Delta Clipper, 24, 33–38, 58n31 origin, 38–39 renamed, 42–43 rollout, 41–42 testing, 42–45 DC-XA Program, 18, 27, 38–45, 276, 318 accomplishments, 45 cancellation, 55–56 compared to DC-X Program, 42 compared to X-34 Renewed Program, 109,  130–132 DC-XA vehicle, 39 flight demonstration, 224 fuel tanks, 50–51, 55 lessons learned, 123, 131–132 mission failures, 118 origin, 41 programmatic requirements, 68 SX-1 testing, 40–45 test models, 276 versus X-33 Program, 45 vulnerabilities, 44 X-34 Program precedents, 112 X-34 Renewed Program, 92, 100 DC-Y Program, 11, 38 Deep Space 2, 36–37, 307, 309–311 Department of Commerce, 13, 21 Department of Defense (DOD), 7, 21 budget cuts, 1 DC-XA Delta Clipper, 24 expendable launch vehicles (ELVs), 41 government-industry cooperation, 13–14,  22–23 launch needs, 2 NASA partnership, 67 payloads,', 'The  flight testing will focus on RLV-type operations, the embedded technologies,  and technology test articles to be carried as experiments.”21 At the end of the  year, an anonymous note-taker spelled out more explicitly the following differences and relationships between the two programs: •\t The X-34 program called for a more modest vehicle as  compared with the X-33, which was designed to investigate the application of a larger number of more advanced  technologies. •\t The X-34 was designed to fly more routinely than the X-33,  thus pushing the envelope in a different direction that  included low-cost, efficient turnaround operations.

Accordingly, failure of the X-33 should not have  impacted continued X-34 development—which, alas, it did. The restart of the X-34 got off to a fast pace with the following tasks completed between March 27 and December 17, 1996—just a little less than  9 months: •\t March 27: NASA Research Announcement NRA 8-14 issued. •\t May 10: Proposal receipt due date. •\t June 6: Orbital Sciences selected to start negotiation. •\t August 28: Contract awarded to Orbital Sciences. •\t September 27: System Requirements Review completed. •\t October 15: Main propulsion system requirements package delivered. •\t November 4: Transonic Wind Tunnel test completed. •\t December 6: Initial loads document completed. •\t December 17: Outer Mold Line freezes.23 Among the many challenges facing the restarted X-34 program were its composite primary structure, thermal protection system, and propulsion system, as  well as the fabrication and durability of its reusable cryogenic tanks.

""The Role of Aviation Technology","['The Power for Flight 112 Pratt & Whitney focused more on the development of individual technologies, with an emphasis on the fan and core components rather than on  a complete engine. While some of the evaluated components exceeded the  efficiency goals, others did not. As a result, the engineers in Hartford estimated  that the overall reduction in specific fuel consumption in a flight engine would  be 15 percent, with direct operating costs at 5 percent. With the exception of  NOx levels, the components failed to meet the EPA’s emissions requirement.33 Carl Ciepluch of Lewis, Donald Davis of GE, and David Gray of Pratt &  Whitney proclaimed the E3 a success at the $200 million program’s completion  in 1985. They were confident that the technology developed during its course  was, and would continue to be, effectively employed in both current and future  advanced transport aircraft engine designs.34 Later estimates claimed that the  performance of the E3 demonstration engines exceeded the expectations of the  program even more, with overall fuel use reduced 18 percent and operating  costs lowered between 5 and 10 percent.35 The experience and generated knowledge of the E3 led to the introduction of  new engines from GE and Pratt & Whitney. One of the program’s legacies was  its role in the great “engine war” of the early 1990s that surrounded the anticipated introduction of the revolutionary Boeing 777 airliner in 1996. Boeing  bet its own future as a manufacturer on a twin-engine aircraft. Two engines  were cheaper to maintain, but required certification for Extended Range Twin  Operations (ETOPS) over water. The three leading engine manufacturers— Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and GE—held 20, 19, and 14 percent of the  world commercial airliner market, respectively, in 1994. The engines they  developed for the 777 were the largest and most powerful ever produced,  with ratings in the area of 100,000 pounds of thrust. Their fan sections were  approximately 10 feet in diameter, with an overall size nearly as wide as the  fuselage of a Boeing 737.', 'The Power for Flight 106 The energy crises of the 1970s and high fuel costs made all three propulsion- related ACEE programs, and their required expenses, palatable, but in different ways. The ECI and E3 dovetailed with the conservative nature of the  commercial aviation industry by offering refinement and the advancement of  the current state of the art, the turbofan engine. The ATP , on the other hand,  was a radical departure from the norm, with the potential of the propeller’s  return to the forefront of commercial aviation. Donald Nored remarked,  “The climate made people do things that normally they’d be too conservative  to do.”14 ACEE 1: Engine Component Improvement Beginning in 1975, the ECI Program consisted of two parts that focused on  improving the performance and fuel efficiency of new production engines  and three specific turbofan engines already in service with the introduction  of advanced components. The Performance Improvement (PI) effort led by  John E. McAulay at Lewis addressed the GE CF6 and the Pratt & Whitney  JT8D and JT9D. Those engines—the first generation of American turbofans  introduced in the United States—were instantly successful, and the aviation  industry anticipated their long-term use into the early 21st century. The Engine  Diagnostics effort addressed the reduction of performance deterioration by  1 percent after the CF6 and JT9D engines had gone into service by focusing  on revised maintenance procedures.15 The PI effort began with a feasibility study that included extensive industry  cooperation. Eastern Airlines and Pan American worked in a direct advisory  capacity with NASA. Both GE and Pratt & Whitney collaborated directly  with Boeing, Douglas, United Airlines, and American Airlines in advisory  capacities. Pratt & Whitney formed a partnership with Trans World Airlines  to create a cost/benefit methodology.', 'The Power for Flight 180 Glenn, GE, and Pratt & Whitney. Refinement during UEET and after led to  a new alloy capable of withstanding temperatures of 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit,  which was a 100-degree increase over the limits of operational turbine disks.45  ME3 first appeared on GE and Pratt & Whitney’s Engine Alliance GP7200  engine in 2007 and became a central element of GE’s GEnx turbofan.46 UEET evolved into the NASA Office of Aerospace Technology’s Vehicle  Systems Program in 2003. It coordinated its efforts with IHPTET and VAATE,  as well as similar programs sponsored by DOE, the FAA, and the EPA to avoid  duplication and maximize the resources of each organization.47 Programs like UEET kept Lewis operating through the 1990s and early  21st century, but personnel could suffer the ups and downs of congressional  funding. When the House Science Committee cut the funding, enthusiastic  bipartisan and active lobbying by Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH)  and others from the Cleveland area restored a minuscule $29.5 million of the  overall $14 billion NASA budget, but they kept 3,000 jobs in Cleveland.48  There was a balance between pushing technology to keep American aviation  competitive and keeping congressional districts employed and supported with  Federal funding. The AGATE and GAP Programs The Advanced General Aviation Transportation Experiments (AGATE) program—a consortium of NASA, the FAA, industry, universities, and nonprofit  groups—worked to revitalize the U.S. general aviation industry’s role in the  global marketplace in the 1990s. Since its heyday in 1978, when annual airframe production reached 17,800, the industry suffered from a steady decline  that bottomed out in 1993 with only 964 aircraft leaving factories. Moreover,  the average general aviation aircraft flying in the early 1990s was of 1960s  vintage with an outdated cockpit, airframe, and propulsion system. The impetus to improve the capability of general aviation was there.', 'The Power for Flight 26 atomic-armed bomber as well. Former Wright Aeronautical employees created  Pratt & Whitney in 1925 to design and market the Wasp radial engine, which,  like the Wright J-5, was a key marker in the emergent technology leading to the  modern commercial and military aviation in the 1920s and 1930s. The need for  aircraft that could fly faster than current technology, such as the combination  of the powerful and established radial engine with the constant-speed propeller,  would allow was becoming more urgent almost daily. The impetus for aeronautical gas turbines came from within the aviation  community. Airframe manufacturer Lockheed Aircraft Corporation began  work on its L-1000 turbojet in 1940 in the first serious American attempt to  work with the new technology. Nathan C. Price came to Lockheed in the late  1930s to develop steam turbines for aircraft but then turned to a gas turbine  instead. His hiring coincided with the company’s realization that a new type  of power plant was needed to attain radically higher speeds. Lockheed vice  president of engineering Hall L. Hibbard committed the company to the  project since he believed that no engine manufacturer would build the engine.85 Lockheed developed the L-1000 for the L-133, an entirely new aircraft that  relied entirely upon jet propulsion for power and control through small jets in  the wingtips. Lockheed designers predicted that the new airplane would reach  625 mph at 50,000 feet. Lockheed was ready to develop both the engine and  airframe by 1941 and formally submitted its plans to the Army Air Forces in  1942. Discussions continued until May 1943, when the Army Air Forces told  Lockheed that other companies had been working on other jet engine designs  since 1941. The Army Air Forces awarded Lockheed a long-term contract in  mid-1943 and designated the L-1000 the XJ-37.']","Pratt & Whitney Aircraft contributed to aircraft engine development through the 578-DX demonstrator engine, Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles (ACTIVE) program, and Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program. In contrast, General Electric's contributions include the F101 engine, F404 turbofan, F414 engine, GE36 UDF UHB engine, GE90 engine series, and GEnx turbofan."
"Compare the roles of Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations in studying asteroids, particularly in the case of (66391) 1999 KW4.","Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations played crucial roles in studying asteroids, particularly in the case of (66391) 1999 KW4. Arecibo radar observations were used to reveal the equatorial bulge of the primary asteroid and the presence of a satellite, which had likely survived after the asteroid had spun up via the YORP process and shed material that re-accreted into a satellite. The shape of the primary and the presence of the satellite were revealed as a result of Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations taken in May 2001. The Arecibo radar observations were used to create a 3D shape model of the asteroid, which was then refined using more sophisticated shape representations. The Goldstone radar observations were used to acquire images with a resolution of 3.75 meters, which helped to constrain the shape model. The combination of Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations allowed for a more accurate representation of the time history of the observed radar frequency bandwidths, which is important for analyzing spin-state changes due to close planetary encounters. In summary, Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations worked together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4, including its shape, spin rate, and satellite.","['The  former enabled the first YORP detection using radar data by Patrick Taylor of  Cornell University and colleagues, while the latter is important for analyzing  spin-state changes due to close planetary encounters.43 For close Earth-approaching asteroids with strong signals (high signal-to- noise ratio), the resolution in time delay is limited by the rate at which signals  radar observations of near-Earth objects from the mid-1980s until cancer took him far  too early in December 2008. 41.\t S.

The shape of the primary and the presence of  the satellite were revealed as a result of Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations taken in May 2001.41 Ostro and colleagues concluded that this satellite, with a mean diameter of about 500 meters, currently orbits the primary  asteroid (mean diameter about 1.5 kilometers) every 17.4 hours. The primary  has a rapid rotation period of about 2.8 hours, although earlier in its lifetime  it presumably spun a bit faster when shedding material. As used in 2018, this 3D modeling technique begins with an attempt to fit  the radar dataset with an ellipsoid, and if the spin-pole direction is not known  in advance, then a trial-and-error grid search is undertaken whereby the pole  direction is systematically varied until there is a best fit of the radar observations. The technique can then proceed using more sophisticated shape representations until the rotating shape model allows an accurate representation of  the time history of the observed radar frequency bandwidths. To help ensure  that the derived shape model evolves toward reality, certain constraints or  penalties are assigned if the model begins to evolve into an unrealistic shape.  With regard to these constraints, JPL radar scientist Lance Benner notes,  “[I]t’s very easy to get a model that looks kind of like a sea urchin, that provides a really nice fit to the data, but there’s no way that asteroids look like sea  urchins.”42 By 2015, the modeling software process could deal with one object  of a binary system as well as time-variable spin rates and spin impulses.', 'P.

The 2003 NASA  Near-Earth Object Science Definition Team report noted that the number of  Earth close approaches by long-period comets is less than 1 percent of comparably sized near-Earth asteroids.57 Nevertheless, there were radar observations of comets, beginning with Arecibo radar observations of periodic Comet  Encke on 2–8 November 1980, that were carried out from a distance of just  over 0.3 au. Paul Kamoun of MIT and colleagues estimated that the nucleus  diameter of Comet Encke was 3 kilometers (with large uncertainties of +4.6  and –2 kilometers) using the observed limb-to-limb bandwidth and values  for the comet’s rotation period and rotation axis direction determined from  optical data.58 Kamoun made successful Arecibo radar observations of periodic Comet  Grigg-Skjellerup in late May and early June 1982, and the very narrow bandwidth of less than 1 Hertz suggested either a very slow nucleus rotation or that  the radar was looking nearly along the rotation axis of the comet’s nucleus.59  Successful Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations of long-period Comet  IRAS-Araki-Alcock were carried out during this comet’s close Earth approach  (0.03 au) on 11 May 1983.60 These were the first successful comet radar observations from Goldstone; the rapid motion of the comet on the sky, due to its  relatively high 73-degree inclination, highlighted an advantage of the steerable  Goldstone antenna. Whereas the larger, but fixed, Arecibo antenna is more  sensitive than the Goldstone antenna, the Goldstone antenna could track the  target and hence observe it over larger regions of sky and integrate the signal  over longer intervals of time. The relatively large nucleus was estimated to  be in the range of 6–12 kilometers, with a rotational period of 1–2 days.']","Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations played a collaborative role in studying asteroids, particularly in the case of (66391) 1999 KW4, as they jointly revealed the shape of the primary and the presence of the satellite."
What was the purpose of the X-34 RLV concept in terms of space transportation and payload delivery?,"The X-34 RLV concept aimed to develop a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) that would significantly reduce the cost of access to space from $10,000 per pound of payload to $1,000 per pound of payload. The primary objectives of the X-34 program were to:

1. Stimulate the development of a reusable commercial launch capability for low-Earth orbit payloads that would significantly reduce costs.
2. Demonstrate technologies applicable to future launch vehicles, including design, follow-on use of the vehicle as a test bed, and low-operating costs with rapid turnaround.
3. Provide a test bed for flight-testing new RLV technologies, either by embedding them into the design or flying them as piggyback experiments or upgrades in dedicated technology demonstration flights.

The X-34 RLV concept aimed to achieve these objectives by developing a small, mostly reusable launch system that would provide significant reductions in launch cost and demonstrate cost-reducing reusability and operability concepts in actual orbital launch operations. The program aimed to begin flight tests in late 1997, demonstrate orbital launch capability in mid-1998, and conduct two dedicated suborbital technology test/demonstration flights in addition to the test flights required for development and qualification of the launch system.","['Promise Denied 66 the program start, the editors of Aviation Week & Space Technology commented,  “Developing a financially viable X-34 will be an early tryout of the reusable  launch vehicle (RLV) concept the U.S. hopes will return it to leadership in  commercial space transportation. For an aerospace industry faced with atrophy of its traditional government customer, the X-34 project will eventually  stress a launcher in a grueling and still largely unfamiliar test regime—the  free market.”6 Gary E. Payton, then NASA’s Deputy Associate Administrator for Space  Transportation and Technology, proved a key figure in advancing the program.  Payton, who thought that the X-33 should be supported by a smaller technology demonstrator, contacted the USAF’s Air Force Materiel Command  (AFMC) at Wright-Patterson AFB, in Dayton, Ohio, to request the next available X vehicle number, which turned out to be the X-34.7 NASA Marshall Briefs the Industry on X-33 and X-34 Prior to the issuance of the formal Cooperative Agreement Notice, NASA  Marshall presented an X-33 and X-34 overview briefing on October 19, 1994.  It was shared with industry representatives from Aerojet, Allied Signal, Fiber  Material, Martin Marietta Aerospace Division, McDonnell Douglas (MD- D), Pratt & Whitney (P&W), Pennsylvania State University, Rocketdyne,  Rockwell International (RI), and Refractory Composites Inc. The briefing  reviewed the program objectives; potential X-34 attributes; launch vehicle  perspectives; NASA funding; program assumptions; and the cooperative agreement definition, features, notices, and schedule.  The briefing identified the following X-34 RSB program objectives:  1.\t Stimulate the development of a reusable commercial  launch capability for low-Earth orbit payloads that would  significantly reduce costs.  2.\t Demonstrate technologies applicable to future launch  vehicles, including design, follow-on use of the vehicle as  a test bed, and low-operating costs with rapid turnaround.  3.', 'Whither X-34? 277 that the overall objective of the OIG review as stated in the executive summary, was “to assess the status of the X-34 Technology Demonstrator Project,  through fiscal year (FY) 1999, in meeting technology requirements for the  next-generation RLV.”64 To this overall objective, however, the OIG added that  “[t]o evaluate NASA’s planned use of X-34 technologies, it was necessary that  our review also address strategic planning for Space Transportation and the  role the X-34 was expected to play in meeting Agency Space Transportation  technology requirements.”65 The role of the X-34 had already been determined  under the X-34’s previous program status.  In Appendix B to the audit report, the OIG presented the following overview regarding the need for a cheaper post-Space Shuttle launch vehicle.  Since the 1970s, NASA has searched for a cheaper launch vehicle,  which led to the decision to build the Space Shuttle. Although the  original intent of the Space Shuttle Program was to significantly  reduce NASA’s cost of access to space, the Shuttle has not come  close to the flight rates (as high as 57 flights annually) anticipated  early in the program. The Shuttle fleet is currently able to sustain  only about seven or eight flights per year, and the maximum  flights in any one year was nine (1985). As a result, the Shuttle  has proven expensive to launch (about $300–$500 million per  launch depending on the number of flights lunched annually),  and NASA has spent much of the last decade looking for a way to  reduce launch costs. NASA’s original goal of reducing the launch  cost from $10,000 per pound to $1,000 per pound by 2006 may  not be realized until 2010–2011 or later.  NASA’s Access to Space study in 1993 determined that an RLV  offered advantages over use of an expendable launch vehicle.', 'The  overarching intent remained the same as in the first X-34 program—namely,  to reduce the cost of access to space from $10,000 per pound of payload to  $1,000 per pound of payload. Announcement NRA 8-14 called for testing  key technologies “by building a test bed technology demonstration vehicle,  as well as providing RLV technology flight experiments.” The X-34 effort was  to be an accelerated fixed-budget program; innovative ideas are sought in all  areas of research to enable meaningful technology demonstrations within the  limited budget and schedule constraints.” The announcement also contained  an option/renewal provision, which was subsequently awarded for additional  flight test demonstrations “averaging 2 per month over a period of 1 year after  completion of the initial test flights.” Finally, the announcement identified  the “expected program funding” at $60 million [$92 million in 2016] for  the vehicle portion and an additional $2 million [$3 million in 2016] for the  experiments. The technical and mission requirements for this resurrected X-34  RLV, now designated the X-34 Technology Testbed Demonstrator (TTD) are  listed in Table 4.1.8', 'The “First” X-34: A Prequel 77 NASA’s objectives would be considered fulfilled if the design, development,  and testing (DD&T) of the system were deemed to be successful.  Orbital Sciences’ objectives were to 1.\t stimulate growth in Orbital’s principal market—microspace—by  reducing the very significant transportation-to-orbit cost burden, 2.\t develop the next-generation product in the company’s Pegasus/Taurus  line of small launchers in order to maintain Orbital’s market share in  small satellite launch services in the face of increasing domestic and  overseas competition, and 3.\t expand its overall knowledge and technology base.  Rockwell International’s objectives were to 1.\t effect a leveraged, reduced-cost entry in the new commercial launch  services market and 2.\t enhance its technology base for similar, larger products.  The industry partnership’s final objectives would be considered fulfilled  only after the system reached profitable commercial operational status. Thus  the industry objectives extended beyond the time limits of the cooperative  agreement. Accordingly, the X-34 would be applied specifically to the DD&T  aspects of the program, intended to achieve several objectives: 1.\t Develop and flight-test a small (1.0 to 1.5 times Pegasus payload  class), mostly reusable launch system providing  a.\t significant reductions in launch cost (the goal was a 3:1 reduction  in dollars per pound to orbit compared to Pegasus);  b.\t the capability of flight-testing new RLV technologies, either by  embedding them into the design (“embedded technologies”) or  flying them as piggyback experiments or upgrades in dedicated  technologies demonstration flights; and  c.\t a demonstration of cost-reducing reusability and operability concepts in actual orbital launch operations.  \t 2.\t Begin flight tests in late 1997. \t 3.\t Demonstrate orbital launch capability in mid-1998 and conduct two  dedicated suborbital technology test/demonstration flights in addition to the test flights required for development and qualification of  the launch system. \t 4.']","The X-34 RLV concept was designed for space transportation and payload delivery, with a focus on providing a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) capable of carrying payloads to space."

Peterson conducted a survey of public attitudes and perceptions of asteroid impact hazards, likely the first of its kind.  In their sample of 200 college students, impact risk ranked 14th out of 24 on  a list of risks to the American public. Even then, this risk was considered to  be “distant in time” or “non-immediate.”20 A COMPELLING NARRATIVE, AN UNBELIEVABLE THREAT Why does the catastrophic impact narrative keep appearing in pop culture?  Why do authors and producers continue to perpetuate it? Three elements  make this narrative particularly compelling, especially to moviegoing audiences. Slovic’s work on risk assessment, which explores beliefs and perceptions that shape attitudes toward risks, helps to explain how the unique  characteristics of this disaster narrative may help sustain it. Slovic and colleagues have developed a matrix that assesses public attitudes toward various risks based on two major factors: “dread risk” and “unknown risk.”21  Together, these factors capture elements that make something seem particularly “risky” to people—an uncontrollable, indiscriminate, catastrophic, or  unknown risk. Although asteroid impact risk has not been mapped in their  matrix, it is worth noting that “satellite crashes” are pretty high on the high- dread, high-unknown quadrant. But where a satellite crash would have limited effects were it to fall on a populated area, asteroid impact risk is “unique  in its combination of very low probability and very great consequence.”22 The asteroid-impact narrative consistently depicts impacts as catastrophic  events. As one scientist has said: “This is also an equal-opportunity hazard,  with everyone on the planet at risk from impacts.”23 Paris and New York City  make repeated appearances in impact-disaster movies not only because they  are so easily identifiable but also because they enable a display of the extent  of damage: whether by direct impact, tsunami, or resulting panic, everyone  is affected.', '189 CHAPTER 7\u2002 •\u2002 “killer Asteroids”: Popular Depictions And Public Policy Influence  face but even the composition of planetary bodies, it became clearer not only  that our own planet had been shaped dramatically by continuous impacts,  but also that these events were not just a thing of the past.  By the 1990s, this expanding understanding of the impact history of the  solar system prompted Congress to task NASA with surveying near-Earth  objects (NEOs) and led to a golden era of mass-media treatments of asteroid impact threats, with extinction-level events appearing in over 25 different works of fiction in that decade. Short films, movies, TV programs, and  computer games all subjected characters to different versions of the asteroid- impact scenario.  In a survey of 90 “cinematic film, video, and television productions” about  asteroids or comets between 1936 and 2004, William Hartwell found that  30 percent addressed impact hazards.13 Between 1994 and 2004, he noted  a marked increase in threat scenarios, with more than half of the productions he surveyed emphasizing impacts. Hartwell claimed the increase was  “a direct result” of the Shoemaker-Levy incident.14  Interest in the impact-threat narrative has continued into the 21st century.  Although not as visible, debate over the non-negligible possibility of asteroid  impacts with Earth—and some initial predictions of possible impacts by the  asteroids Apophis in 2029 and 2011 AG5 in 2040 (later dismissed)—helped  sustain this narrative.

What evidence supports the claim that the X-34 Program was successful despite its cancellation and numerous challenges?,"1. The X-34 Program was designed to be a robust and flexible launch vehicle, with features such as an expanded launch window, site and weather, captive carry, and safe separation. 2. The program aimed to demonstrate key reusable launch vehicle (RLV) technologies, including automated mission planning, payload variability, and autonomous reprogram. 3. The X-34 Program was seen as a necessary step towards developing the next generation of reusable launch vehicles, with the potential to provide data points to match against the Space Shuttle for future aerodynamic and reusability studies. 4. The program's design was completed, and a successful Critical Design Review (CDR) was held, indicating that the system was ready for manufacturing and testing. 5. The program's cancellation was seen as a setback, with some arguing that it would not affect the technological success of the X-33 program. 6. The X-34 Program was seen as a necessary test bed for demonstrating future RLV technologies in a hypersonic, high-altitude flight and operations environment. 7. The program's cancellation was seen as an unattractive option, with some arguing that it would not provide a visible success for NASA Marshall and NASA. 8. The program's design and testing had already made significant progress, with the A-1A unpowered vehicle complete and on the runway, and the A-2 powered vehicle complete and undergoing tests. 9. The program's cancellation was seen as a setback for the development of reusable launch vehicles, with some arguing that it would not provide a test bed for demonstrating future RLV technologies. 10. The program's design and testing had already made significant progress, with the MC-1 (Fastrac) engine testing continuing at Rocketdyne's California facility with 45 hot-fire tests already completed at the Stennis Space Center. These points collectively suggest that the X-34 Program was successful despite its cancellation and numerous challenges, as it had made significant progress in its design and testing, and its cancellation was seen as a setback for the development of reusable launch vehicles.","['Hammer Fall: Termination of the X-34 Program 317 \t – robust launch (expanded launch window, site and weather, captive carry, and safe separation);  \t – flexibility (automated mission planning, payload variability);  \t – robust land (autoland, expanded weather capability, variable site,  differential GPS); and  \t – robust abort (autonomous reprogram, range capability).51 Fuhrmann added, as a lesson learned, that it was important to fly a vehicle  quickly, noting that continued program financing gives priority to a vehicle  that has been flown.52 Failure to fly the X-34 resulted in a lower rating on the  Technical Rating Level (TRL) rating scale used by NASA, essentially a down- grading that, in an era of intense project competition, was unfortunate.53 As well, the information that would have been obtained from a successful  X-34 test flight program would have provided data points to match against the  Space Shuttle for future aerodynamic and reusability studies in planning for  the development of the next generation of reusable launch vehicles.  While the X-34 program was still in progress, two German aeronautical  engineers—Robert H. Schmucker and Christoph P . Schmucker—likewise  expressed the need for additional data that was to be obtained from both the  X-33 and X-34 programs in their 1998 AIAA paper. They noted that  Numerous proposals for new and advanced systems have been  published which claim to be significantly superior to existing  launchers. But contrary to this, the real progress is small or even  not existing! The reason for this discrepancy lies in the concentration of  endless paperwork, which is mostly without any substantiation.  It is well known that improvements only stem from realistic hardware activities which follow a stepwise approach. A reorientation  towards building hardware represents the key activities necessary  for future launchers. In the overall spectrum X-33 and X-34 are definitely the right  projects to get better answers for cost and mass of reusable systems.', 'Promise Denied 350 been developed for X-34,” and concluded, “that meets program requirements,  supports mission operations, and will demonstrate key RLV [reusable launch  vehicle] technologies.

Darrow, Jr. (a co-author on the previously noted paper noted  regarding program accomplishments), enumerated six lessons learned: 1.\t the main propulsion system Program design team should not have  been brought up to full staff level until the system design freeze  was completed; 2.\t a significant number of subsystem components were changed between  the “rough order of magnitude” bids from vendors and the final negotiations and contract agreements, thus causing significant rework by  the designers and analysts;  3.\t the initial design drawings were not vendor specific, thus causing  necessary changes to be made in order to reduce cost and improve  delivery time; 4.\t the use of a common CAD system is a requirement for a program  where there are numerous interface concerns between two organizations (In the case of the X-34, the Orbital and NASA Marshall CAD  models were always out of sync by a few weeks); 5.\t the suppliers of the design and analysis should have formal notification and acknowledgment on all changes to specifications, interface  drawings, and other engineering change notices that impact the subsystems, otherwise the supplier will inevitably get out of sync with the  prime contractor; and 6.\t in an experimental flight program, with a compressed schedule and  concurrent engineering, changes are inevitable, therefore, the teams  that survive are the ones that learn how to adjust to this pace and  environment.63', 'Whither X-34? 287 •\t NASA Marshall and NASA need a visible success;  •\t second- and third-generation reusable launch vehicles need a test platform for technology demonstration in relevant environments; and  •\t project continuation would provide a test bed to demonstrate future  RLV technologies in a hypersonic, high altitude flight and operations  environment.  The presenter plaintively concluded, “We believe that project cancellation  is an unattractive option.”87  In a June 22 Pathfinder Program Review of the X-34 and the X-37, John  R. London noted the program’s current status: •\t A-1A unpowered vehicle complete and on the runway at Edwards  AFB with a series of captive-carry flights and high-speed tow tests  underway. •\t A-2 powered vehicle complete and undergoing tests at Orbital’s  Dulles facility. •\t A-3 airframe essentially complete at Orbital’s Dulles facility. •\t MC-1 (Fastrac) engine testing continuing at Rocketdyne’s California  facility with 45 hot-fire tests already completed at the Stennis  Space Center.88 London added that the restructuring effort then underway could possibly  lead to an increase in ground testing for the engine and vehicle, avionics modules, and new Propulsion Test Article or to refocusing the project to support  the “Second Generation Program.” This hint of the X-34’s future came to  pass, as the restructuring of the project—which made continued funding of  the X-34 dependent on the follow-on Space Launch Initiative—signaled the  end to the reusable launch vehicle program. That sad dénouement is reviewed  in the final chapter of this book.', 'Critics, however, have suggested canceling the X-34 program, arguing that it is geared toward developing an operational vehicle, not an experimental vehicle, and that its cancellation would not  affect the technological success of the X-33 program.”61 It should be noted that  the X-34 program referenced above related to the first “large X-34” program,  as opposed to the follow-on X-34 that called for a much smaller technology  test bed demonstrator. The panel raised specific issues relating to the X-33 by noting that some  analysts thought that the program was geared too closely to the development  of a vehicle to get to the Space Station rather than toward the development of  a fully SSTO technology demonstrator. Other critics suggested a competitive  fly-off for competing concepts in order to decrease the possibility of selecting  the wrong technology. They also believed that a fly-off would raise the likelihood of increasing competition in the domestic vehicle launch industry.

"Considering the rotor's speed stability and fuselage's instability, what longitudinal stability characteristics are exhibited by the helicopter in forward flight?","The helicopter exhibits a strong tendency to diverge in pitch, creating the impression of balancing on a ball, which is more pronounced at higher speeds. This characteristic is troublesome because it frequently precipitates or intensifies stalling, which adds to the difficulties because it increases the tendency to pitch up and is accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. The forward displacement of the control from trim necessary to check some of these pitching motions suggests that a short delay in applying corrective control would allow a maneuver severe enough that control would be lost. The helicopter also exhibits longitudinal oscillations, which can be initiated by a momentary aft motion of the stick. These oscillations can be recovered by simply returning the stick to the trim position. The instability with angle of attack arises as a result of forward speed and is greatest at the highest speeds. The helicopter's longitudinal stability characteristics are influenced by the rotor's speed stability and the fuselage's instability. The rotor's speed stability tends to cause the machine to return to the original speed, while the fuselage's instability causes the machine to depart from the trim speed. The combination of these two factors results in the helicopter's longitudinal stability characteristics in forward flight.","['665 Document 5-44 (a–b) Longitudinal Stability in Forward Flight: During the course of the performance tests, considerable flying was done at relatively high speeds, approaching the  limits imposed by blade stalling. It was found quite difficult to hold steady conditions because of a strong tendency of the machine to diverge in pitch, creating the  impression of balancing on a ball. This characteristic seemed far more pronounced  with some of the rotors tested than with others, but was always troublesome. Upward  pitching was most troublesome as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling,  which added to the difficulties because it increased the tendency to pitch up and  was accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. The forward  displacement of the control from trim necessary to check some of these pitching  motions suggested that a short delay in applying corrective control would allow a  maneuver severe enough that control would be lost. Although there seemed ample  control to stop downward pitching, an uncomfortable amount of forward control  was again required in order to check the subsequent upward pitching. These characteristics suggested a pronounced type of instability. The tendency to depart from the trim speed and the necessity of applying  appreciable control deflection against a pitching maneuver involving acceleration,  initiated either by control or by external disturbances, is apparent throughout the  speed range normally used in forward flight. It becomes much less pronounced,  however, at the lower speeds. Shortly after the embryo pilot experiences forward flight, he is impressed with  the necessity for having to constantly fly the helicopter. At first thought the reasons  for this situation are not clear. It is common knowledge that a flapping rotor tilts  to the rear if speed is increased, thus tending to cause the machine to return to  the original speed. This condition constitutes stability of the rotor with respect to  speed. Wind-tunnel tests of the R-4 fuselage have shown it to be unstable, but this  instability is evidently outweighed by the rotor stability just discussed, inasmuch  as measurements of stick position have shown that the stick does move forward to  trim at increasing steady speeds.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 666 ratio and becomes more pronounced at higher speeds. The second source is the  unstable fuselage. It may be well to point out here that airplanes can and do exhibit instability  with angle of attack at times, but this condition is recognized as unsatisfactory and  is generally prevented by keeping the center of gravity sufficiently well forward. The effects of the instability with respect to angle of attack on the flight characteristics of the helicopter were subsequently investigated in more detail, first in  the low-speed flight range and then at successively higher speeds. It was found that  in maneuvers in which the stick was abruptly deflected from trim and held, the  normal acceleration built up at an increasing rate for a length of time detectable  to the pilot. Furthermore, the acceleration and pitching velocity, at least for small  stick deflections when the maneuver could be continued for a reasonable time,  did not reach a maximum until 3 or 4 seconds had elapsed. The acceleration and  pitching velocity in this type of maneuver apparently would continue to increase for  even greater periods of time were it not for the stabilizing influence of the associated speed change. The stick forces accompanying these maneuvers are undesirable.  After transient effects have disappeared they become somewhat unstable; that is,  a push in pull-ups or a pull in push changes the magnitude of the forces depending upon blade characteristics. Of course it is highly desirable that these forces  be stable. Longitudinal Oscillations: Stick-fixed longitudinal oscillations of the HNS-1  were studied to shed more light on the interaction of the stability with speed and  stability with angle of attack. Studies have been prepared of two recorded time  studies of attempted stick-fixed oscillations. For these cases the helicopter had a set  of experimental blades of low solidity, not production blades. Low solidity necessitates higher pitch of the same rpm and thus stalling was encountered [for] fewer  forward speeds than for the production blades. The first slide (Figure 1 [not reproduced]) shows an oscillation initiated from  steady level flight at 40 miles per hour by a momentary aft motion of the stick.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 672 recovery could be made by simply returning the stick to the trim position. Stick-free  stability could be provided in this case by mechanical means such as simple springs. Since the instability with angle of attack arises as a result of forward speed, and  is greatest at the highest speeds, it seems logical to attempt to obtain the desired  stabilizing forces by using some form of horizontal tail surface mounted on the  fuselage. This is particularly valid, of course, for the over-coming [sic] of the instability of the fuselage itself. For the rotor instability, it seems basically more logical to  arrive at a self-contained means for eliminating its instability, but it further appears  that the more practical immediate solution may nevertheless lie in the use of some  form of horizontal tail surface. Preliminary calculations indicate that [a] rather  small tail area should suffice; for example, calculations for a sample two-place helicopter indicated that about 4 square feet would be needed to stabilize the fuselage,  and that an additional area of about 4 square feet should serve to stabilize the rotor. One obvious disadvantage resulting from the use of the tail surface lies in the  undesired vertical loads and pitching moments developed in hovering and vertical flight. For the areas mentioned these forces are actually quite small but may  be further reduced if desired by using a bi-plane tail surface, thus presenting less  projected area in vertical flow, or by using a free-floating tail surface arranged to  be effective only in forward flight. More serious problems arise from the fact that  in forward flight, a change from level flight to climb or to autorotation results in  a sizeable change in angle of attack of the tail surface. This change occurs because  the attitude angle of the helicopter remains roughly constant while the flight path  angle changes. This situation suggests that for the faster and more highly-powered  helicopters, at least, the tail surface should be made to move in conjunction with  the pitch controls or should be made free floating.', 'The investigation also disclosed the fact that the assumption that the rotor force vector is at all times perpendicular to the tip-path plane during rolling or pitching may give highly misleading  results when applied to the calculation of rotor characteristics. Most of the published literature on helicopter stability is written for the specialist in stability theory. For the nonspecialist, an explanation of the fundamental  ideas underlying helicopter stability in terms of the basic physical parameters rather  than of specialized mathematics has been prepared and is presented in Technical  Note 1982. Three primary helicopter-rotor stability parameters that influence the  flying qualities of helicopters are discussed in fundamental terms. Static stability of  the helicopter and the stick-fixed oscillation in hovering and forward flight are also  discussed in the same fashion because of their influence on flying qualities.']","The helicopter exhibits a pronounced type of instability in forward flight, characterized by a tendency to diverge in pitch, particularly upward pitching, which can lead to loss of control if not corrected promptly."
Analyze the impact of NASA's budget reallocation on international collaborative space projects.,"NASA's budget reallocation had a significant impact on international collaborative space projects. The reallocation led to delays and cancellations of joint missions, including the International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM). The mission was initially planned as a dual-spacecraft mission, but due to budget constraints, NASA decided to cancel one of the spacecraft, effectively ending the international collaboration. The reallocation also led to changes in the scope and design of the mission, with the remaining spacecraft being renamed Ulysses and focusing on a single objective. The impact of NASA's budget reallocation on international collaborative space projects was significant, as it disrupted the planned cooperation and led to changes in the scope and design of the mission. The reallocation also highlighted the challenges of international cooperation in space exploration, as it required a significant amount of resources and coordination between different agencies and countries.

Any delays would have to take  into account the next possible alignment of the planet for a swing-by. By the end of 1978, the Senate Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over NASA’s budget proposed that ISPM be delayed for two years,  “(1) to reflect the delays in Shuttle development, and (2) because the committee was concerned that the IUS necessary to send the two spacecraft   on the flight path would not be adequate and that NASA should develop a  high-energy upper stage (Centaur) instead.”51 Despite $135 million already  awarded for the mission by this point, ISPM was in serious danger. The  Carter administration submitted an amended FY 1981 budget request to  Congress calling for a two-year launch delay and roughly $43 million dollar  budget cut for ISPM.52 Protests arose from European nations. In response,  U.S. Representative Edward Boland claimed, “The action threatens not only  international cooperation in space, but other areas of technology as well.”53  A few months later, the House Appropriations Committee recommended in  a 1980 supplemental bill that ISPM be canceled, claiming that the two-year  delay would cost at least an additional $150 million. While ESA reacted to  the possible cancellation with strong diplomatic protest, Representative Don  Fuqua (D-FL), chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology,  successfully argued “that the cancellation of the funds would constitute legislation in an appropriations bill—a violation of House Rules.”54 This victory  was short-lived, though, as NASA ultimately dropped out of the ISPM.', 'International cooperation is no longer an option but a must for high-priced  missions such as Mars sample return.

I am just strongly enough  oriented towards strengthening U.S. science at this time to argue that this  should be an all U.S. mission if at all possible.32 NASA’s Naugle recognized that while U.S. scientists were increasingly concerned about international cooperation, Congress was becoming more interested in the idea of cooperation in space. “Congress views such cooperation  as a reduction in funding requirements,” Naugle told Fletcher, “whereas the  U.S. scientists regard such missions which will carry U.S. and foreign experiments as a reduction in their opportunities to do research.”33 To Naugle, and  perhaps other NASA officials, cooperation looked like a good compromise,  as it would produce “a net increase in the number of flights and hence a net  increase in the total opportunities for U.S. scientists.”34  By the end of 1974, in Europe, as ESRO was considering and sorting mission priorities for the 1980s, a stereoscopic mission to study coronal phenomena emerged as a compelling and worthwhile candidate for a future mission.  ESRO’s Launching Programs Advisory Committee (LPAC) included both  OOE and stereoscopic missions as top priorities for mission-definition  studies.35 During the summer of 1974, in the United States, the idea rose  of perhaps combining the OOE and stereoscopic missions. In response to  Simpson’s 26 June letter, Fletcher wrote, “The best chance of implementing  an out-of-ecliptic mission is with a mission mode that will attract as wide a  constituency as possible,” and a combined stereoscopic and OOE mission  would do.36 These developments created a “ripe” atmosphere for cooperation. At an ESRO/NASA science program review held at the European Space  Technology Center in February 1974, ESRO and NASA agreed to cooperate  on two joint missions, one of which was an OOE mission.', '301 CHAPTER 12\u2002 •\u2002 International Cooperation In Solar System Exploration  The American space science community reacted with concern about losing research opportunities in a cooperative mission. NASA was concerned  about using the Pioneer probe backup for a new mission. By the mid-1970s,  both ESRO and NASA advisory committees had determined the feasibility  of stereoscopic observations for an OOE mission. Both institutions seemed  to agree that this option would appeal to a broader scientific constituency to  justify program approval. NASA and ESA pursued a number of more concrete cooperative agreements, culminating in the signing of an MOU for  the ISPM. Budgetary concerns during the Reagan administration affected  the shape of the mission, leading to the cancellation of one of two planned  probes. By the 1980s, ISPM, renamed Ulysses in 1984, had become a single- probe mission. Despite the “failure” of cooperation on ISPM, an American- European hybrid OOE mission designed to study the polar regions of the  Sun was launched on the Space Shuttle. The transnational approach that I have taken to the history of Ulysses  highlights the changing meanings and imaginings of cooperation and collaboration between various actors and organizations, such as space agencies,  politicians, space scientists and engineers, and other advocates. At different  times, different individuals saw different values (or perhaps no value at all)  in cooperation on an OOE mission. Ulysses is an interesting case study for  a transnational analysis as it began as a failed project, the dual-spacecraft   ISPM. Yet the project lived on, in the sense that a material transnational  object, the Ulysses probe, was actually built and launched under a different  form of cooperation. So what exactly failed? I suggest that negotiations and lines of cooperation leading to the breakdown of ISPM were a normative representation of  cooperation between the two agencies. Eventually a critical mass of issues  and concerns led to the cancellation of the U.S. spacecraft.']","NASA's budget reallocation led to the cancellation of the Dawn mission, causing suspicion and confusion among international cooperation partners, with some feeling that NASA had not fulfilled its responsibilities to them."
Explore the development of advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft.,"The development of advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft has been an ongoing effort, with significant advancements made in the 1970s and 1980s. The Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP) was initiated in the 1970s, with the goal of developing a more efficient and quieter turboprop engine. The project involved collaboration between NASA, industry, and the military, and resulted in the development of several advanced turboprop engines, including the Allison 578-DX demonstrator engine and the XT38 turboprop engine.

In the 1980s, NASA continued to invest in turboprop engine research, with a focus on reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The agency's efforts led to the development of the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) program, which aimed to develop a turboprop engine that could achieve a 20% reduction in fuel consumption and a 15% reduction in emissions compared to existing engines.

In recent years, NASA has continued to explore the potential of advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft. In 2012, the agency conducted a study on the use of open-rotor engines, which featured external rotating blade forms from the ATP program. The study found that open-rotor engines had the potential to provide reduced fuel consumption and emissions at high levels, and could meet current noise regulations.

Overall, the development of advanced turboprop engines for next-generation aircraft has been an ongoing effort, with significant advancements made in the 1970s and 1980s. NASA's continued investment in turboprop engine research has the potential to lead to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft in the future.","['Index 277 RAF-6, 10, 12 supercritical, 132n8 air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), 179 airships, 3, 40n14 air-to-air interceptors, 54 All Nippon Airways, 196 AlliedSignal, Inc. 169, 176 Allis-Chalmers, 27 Allison Engine Company, 20, 27 570 engine, 118 571 industrial gas turbine engine, 123 578-DX demonstrator engine, 123–124, 123 Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP), 115 relationship with NACA, 19 stator design, 190–191 Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program  (UEET), 179 XT38 turboprop engine, 46n119 alloys, 159, 167–168, 175 Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment studies, 226 Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise  Emissions (ACCESS) study, 216, 226–227,  227 Altitude Wind Tunnel (AWT), 18, 21, 24, 30, 34,  35–36 American Airlines, 103, 152, 194 American Institute of Aeronautics and  Astronautics (AIAA), 217 American Society for Mechanical Engineers  (ASME), 201 Ames Research Center, 66, 224 Advanced Ducted Propulsor (ADP),  185–186, 186 Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST)  program, 188 Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP), 115–116 collaboration with Lockheed Aircraft  Corporation, 57 Concepts and Missions Division, 91 F-111A/F-111B design, 60 F-111/TF-30 Propulsion Program Review  Committee, 61 High-Angle-of-Attack Technology Program  (HATP), 154 High-Speed Research (HSR) program, 197 National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex  (NFAC), 185, 186 “PCA Lite”/”PCA Ultralite,” 153 propulsion-controlled aircraft (PCA) program,  153 STOL conference,', 'The Power for Flight 116 increase cruise efficiency with new design codes. Second, a byproduct of that  work, which included extensive in-flight acoustic testing of propfan models on  NASA’s Lockheed Jetstar multipurpose test bed aircraft maintained by Dryden  Flight Research Center, was the ability to make the blades quieter in operation  to alleviate internal and external noise. The perfection of an aerodynamically  efficient turboprop installation was the third component, which revealed the  ideal mounting in a nacelle on top of the wing for the best results. Finally, there  was the mechanical design of the drive system, especially the pitch-change and  gearbox mechanisms, that were both durable and economical to maintain. This  led to a proposal to modify an Agency Gulfstream with a full-size propfan.44Labelled drawing of a proposed propfan installation on a modified NASA Grumman Gulfstream Testbed. Figure 4-6. This drawing shows a proposed propfan installation on a modified NASA Grumman  Gulfstream test bed. (NASA) As the work on enabling technology continued, Government, industry, and  military studies initiated by NASA investigated the increased application of  advanced turboprop aircraft over turbofan-powered aircraft. Ames contracted  with McDonnell Douglas in 1979 to explore the possibility of integrating  a propfan system into a DC-9/MD-80–type airliner. The resultant report  concluded that a propfan installed on the aft portion of the fuselage was an  important alternative to wing mounting. Lockheed Aircraft, under contract to  Langley, initiated an Advanced Cargo Aircraft Study that revealed that the use  of propfans reduced fuel consumption by 20 percent, noise by 15 percent, and  the required runway length by 25 percent. Lewis awarded study contracts to  McDonnell Douglas and Beech Aircraft for business aircraft, and those studies yielded similar results.

The shape of the primary and the presence of  the satellite were revealed as a result of Arecibo and Goldstone radar observations taken in May 2001.41 Ostro and colleagues concluded that this satellite, with a mean diameter of about 500 meters, currently orbits the primary  asteroid (mean diameter about 1.5 kilometers) every 17.4 hours. The primary  has a rapid rotation period of about 2.8 hours, although earlier in its lifetime  it presumably spun a bit faster when shedding material. As used in 2018, this 3D modeling technique begins with an attempt to fit  the radar dataset with an ellipsoid, and if the spin-pole direction is not known  in advance, then a trial-and-error grid search is undertaken whereby the pole  direction is systematically varied until there is a best fit of the radar observations. The technique can then proceed using more sophisticated shape representations until the rotating shape model allows an accurate representation of  the time history of the observed radar frequency bandwidths. To help ensure  that the derived shape model evolves toward reality, certain constraints or  penalties are assigned if the model begins to evolve into an unrealistic shape.  With regard to these constraints, JPL radar scientist Lance Benner notes,  “[I]t’s very easy to get a model that looks kind of like a sea urchin, that provides a really nice fit to the data, but there’s no way that asteroids look like sea  urchins.”42 By 2015, the modeling software process could deal with one object  of a binary system as well as time-variable spin rates and spin impulses.', 'T.

Think about your last beach  experience. The granular sand can get very hot under the Sun, but it cools  down quickly after sunset. On the other hand, solid boulders near the beach,  with their higher thermal inertia, warm up and cool down far more slowly.  The standard thermal model (STM) assumes that an object is smooth and  spherical, has no thermal inertia, and has been observed at small phase angles.  This STM assumes that the object rotates very slowly, with no thermal emission on its dark hemisphere. These assumptions are often met for relatively  large main-belt asteroids, but it is often not so for the small, irregularly shaped  near-Earth asteroids that cannot always be observed at small phase angles. David A. Allen, using the University of Minnesota’s 30-inch O’Brien  telescope, was the first to use infrared observations and a simplified thermal  model to estimate an asteroid’s diameter in 1970, when he determined that  the diameter of Vesta was 573 kilometers—within 10 percent of the mean  diameter determined by the Dawn spacecraft in 2011 (i.e., 525 kilometers).  This size was significantly larger than the generally accepted measure of Vesta  at the time, about 390 kilometers, which had been derived by E. E. Barnard  via measuring the asteroid’s width with a micrometer back in 1894–95.8 In 1973, David Morrison, then of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawai’i,  set out to observe every known asteroid in opposition after February of that  year with a magnitude brighter than 11.5 (and therefore several kilometers  in size) with the 2.2-meter telescope on Maunakea.', 'Chapter 7: Studying the Rubble of the Solar System 209 disaggregated by one or more impacts into many small pieces, some of which  re-accreted into the present greatly diminished, rubble-pile asteroid…\u200a .”104 Scientists finally got a close-up look at the largest main-belt asteroid, Vesta,  in mid-2011. The Dawn spacecraft effected a rendezvous in July, stayed for  nearly 14 months, and then continued on for a multiyear visit with the dwarf  planet Ceres, beginning in March 2015. This lengthy activity was enabled by  a xenon ion drive propulsion system that had been tested during the earlier  Deep Space 1 mission. The Dawn observations of Vesta pointed toward a differentiated body (core- mantle-crust) with triaxial outer dimensions of 573 by 557 by 446 kilometers.  They confirmed earlier Hubble Space Telescope observations of a giant impact  basin in the southern hemisphere, named Rheasilvia, and also confirmed that  a group of igneous-processed, achondritic meteorites (the so-called HEDs)  originated from this impact event.105 The current silicate surface crust of Vesta  was formed as a result of past impact events, but its formation early in the  solar system’s history required that it have pervasive heating and separation  into layers (differentiation), with the heating being provided by the decay of  short-lived radionuclides like aluminum-26.106 Gravity and shape models suggest that it has an iron-nickel core about 110 kilometers in radius, a larger mantle region, and an upper crust with an average depth of about 22 kilometers.107  104.\tIbid. 105.\tC.

Investigate the effects of microgravity on mouse skeletal muscle adaptation.,"According to the research, mouse skeletal muscle adapts to long-term microgravity in the MDS mission by activating certain inherent compensatory and protective pathways (Cancedda et al., 2012). The force-producing extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle may resist microgravity-induced atrophy by activating these pathways. The ""antigravity"" soleus muscle, which is responsible for walking and standing activities, shows an increased sensitivity to microgravity, adding insight into the mechanisms for resistance of EDL that could contribute to the development of countermeasures to muscle loss in space (Sandonà et al., 2012). 

In another study, mice flown to the space station for 8 days showed a decreased expression of calcium channels, which regulate the contractibility of smooth muscle cells in portal veins that carry blood to the liver (Honda et al., 2012). 

It is also important to note that the Mouse Epigenetics study, one of the JAXA Mouse Habitat missions, aims to study altered gene expression patterns in the organs of male mice that spend 1 month in space, as well as changes in the DNA of their offspring. This study reports on the effects of artificial gravity from the on-orbit centrifuge on maintaining muscle and bone health of the ISS mice. Mice that underwent artificial gravity exposure via regular continuous centrifugation at a 1-g (Earth-simulated) level did not display a significant decrease in soleus and gastrocnemius muscle weight and bone loss, unlike mice on the ISS that received no centrifugation (Shiba et al., 2017). 

Overall, the research suggests that mouse skeletal muscle adapts to microgravity by activating compensatory and protective pathways, and that artificial gravity exposure can help maintain muscle and bone health in space.

These results raise new questions about  the role of artificial gravity countermeasures to maintain  human health during long-duration exploration-class  missions. (Shiba et al., 2017). Studies have also shown  that spaceflight activates lipotoxic pathways (i.e.,  an accumulation of lipid products in cells) in mouse  liver, initiates a loss of retinol, and creates a possible  increased risk of fatty liver disease, thereby opening  new research questions surrounding liver metabolism  and function (Jonscher et al., 2016).  In a long-term mouse mission of 91 days, results  suggest that the force-producing extensor digitorum  longus (EDL) muscle may resist microgravity-induced  atrophy by activating certain inherent compensatory  and protective pathways (Cancedda et al., 2012).  These studies also show an increased sensitivity of  the “antigravity” soleus muscle—the muscle responsible  for walking and standing activities—adding insight  into the mechanisms for resistance of EDL that could  contribute to the development of countermeasures  to muscle loss in space (Sandonà et al., 2012).  Moreover, analysis of specific bone formation and  resorption marker expression in these mice suggested  that the microgravity-induced bone loss was due to  both an increased bone resorption and a decreased  bone deposition. More specifically, the protection  observed in transgenic mice overexpressing the PTN  (pleiotrophin) protein was likely due to higher osteoblast  activity, which aids in bone formation (Tavella et al.,  2012). In mouse cardiovascular studies, mice flown  to the space station for 8 days showed a decreased  expression of calcium channels, which regulate the  contractibility of smooth muscle cells in portal veins  that carry blood to the liver.', 'Image credit:  Shiba et al,  Scientific Reports, 2017.

How do lateral projections like sponsons enhance transverse stability in a seaplane's float or hull?,"Lateral projections like sponsons enhance transverse stability in a seaplane's float or hull by providing additional planing surface and increased lateral stability. They help to counteract the negative metacentric height caused by the aircraft superstructure, which can cause the boat to become laterally unstable while moving through water. Sponsons, in particular, are designed to provide excellent characteristics for taxiing or maneuvering on the water at high speeds, and they are more seaworthy in rough water. They also provide excellent loading platforms, are a better place to store fuel than in the hull, and are structurally sounder and safer. However, they do have some disadvantages, such as greater weight and aerodynamic drag, and they allow greater heeling angles in strong side winds. The form of the sponsons and their exact location on, and angles to, the hull are somewhat critical. In the case of the Boeing 314, it used full cantilever wings, while the Sikorsky S-42 and Martin 130 used limited numbers of supporting struts. The Boeing 314 also had a hull with a single-step design, while the Sikorsky S-42 and Martin 130 had hulls with two transverse steps. The Boeing 314 was the largest of the three clipper ships, with a gross weight of 84,000 pounds, and it was also the most advanced, with a maximum speed of 201 mph and a lift-to-drag ratio of 13.0.

The Boeing 314 was by far the largest of the three clipper ships, with a gross  weight of 84,000 pounds compared to 48,000 for the Sikorsky and 52,252 for the  Martin machine. It was also the most advanced. It could reach a maximum of 201  mph, compared to 182 and 180 mph for the Sikorsky and Martin machines, respectively. It possessed the best lift-to-drag ratio, achieving a maximum lift-drag coefficient of 13.0 compared to 12.2 and 11.9, as well as the best zero-lift drag coefficient,  0.0274 compared to 0.0362 and 0.303, respectively. Boeing built 12 of these flying  boats, the first of which flew in June 1938. (The Sikorsky S-42 had started making  flights with passengers between Miami and Rio de Janeiro in 1934 and across the  Atlantic in 1937; the Martin 130 began its 60-flying-hour, 8,210-mile transpacific  service—via Hawaii, Midway Atoll, Wake Island, and Guam—in late 1936.)', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 308 could be improved by changing its form to give a longer and flatter forebody. A new  forebody was made and tested with the original afterbody, and the improved model  equals in performance the best flying-boat hull. Tests of two models, nos. 11 and  11A, are described in Technical Notes Nos. 464 and 470. Observation of the behavior of the models of hulls tested suggested the possibility of improving performance by a radical change in the form of the main step. A  model was prepared in which the step was much deeper than usual and was pointed  in plan form instead of square across the hull. This model, no. 22, showed a general  performance much superior to the previous model. These results will be issued as  a technical note and it is hoped that a full-scale test of this form may be made to  determine its behavior under operating conditions. A model of a flying boat hull having one form of stub wings or sponsons to provide lateral stability was investigated. Other forms of sponsons have been made for  tests with the same main hull, and in view of the later development of this type of  lateral stabilization, it is planned to extend the application of hulls of other shapes. Floats for seaplanes.—In order to obtain information regarding the performance  of a good high-speed seaplane float, tests were made of a model of a float used on  the Macchi racer 1926. As a result of the tests a float designed to be an improvement of this float and to be used as a parent of future series was tested. This model  showed a marked improvement over the Macchi float. The results of the two tests  are compared in Technical Note No. 473. Fundamental information regarding planing surfaces.—For a large part of the  take-off run of the seaplane, that part of the weight of the craft not supported by  the wings is supported by the hydrodynamic reaction of the water on the bottom  of the float or boat.', '339 Document 5-23 (a–c) Takeoff times range from 17 to 58 seconds, depending on the loading, condition of  wind and water, and on the technique used for the takeoff. The lines of the after portion of the hull upper body were rather difficult to  fair because of the desire to keep sections large in order to provide ample room  inside as far aft as possible for passenger accommodations and to allow for a good  stiff attachment of the tail surfaces. A suitable compromise was made and although  these lines were found satisfactory in the wind tunnel, we afterwards learned during our flight tests that these lines interfered somewhat with the satisfactory function of the original fin and rudder. Lateral stability on the water was obtained by the use of hydrostabilizers, sometimes referred to as sponsons or sea wings. Hydrostabilizers have long been used in  Europe and are being used by a contemporary American aircraft. They have some  very definite advantages as compared to wing tip floats, such as excellent characteristics for taxiing or maneuvering on the water at high speeds; turns can be made at  any direction to the wind in any normal wind velocities; they are more seaworthy in  rough water; they provide excellent loading platforms; are a better place to store fuel  than in the hull; and are structurally sounder and safer. Naturally, they have some  disadvantages, such as greater weight and aerodynamic drag, and, with the aircraft  traveling at slow water speeds they allow greater heeling angles in strong side winds. The form of the hydrostabilizers and their exact location on, and angles to, the  hull are somewhat critical. Inasmuch as there were no tank test data on hydrostabilizers available for study and comparison with full-scale results, we had no definite method of correcting our towing model test results to full-scale performance.  During taxi tests, we found it desirable to reduce the dead rise of the hydrostabilizers from 7½° to 4½°. This reduced angle provides the same righting moment  at 3° less angle of heel.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 24 A large (nearly 11,000- pound) biplane, the H-16’s  entire wing assembly was  mounted atop the hull. Also  high above the hull was a  horizontal tail, which was  fitted upon a long vertical  fin that itself extended well  above the hull from the rear  of the fuselage. All of this  was done to keep the aerodynamic surfaces—not to mention the two engines mounted  between the wings—out of  the water spray during takeoff.  Very importantly, what came  to be known as “tip floats”  were placed atop the upper  wing and beneath the lower  wing. Curtiss realized that any relatively narrow-beamed hull with such a high center of gravity (caused by the aircraft superstructure) needed floats to overcome what  naval architects called “negative metacentric height.”7 This is what caused a boat  to become laterally unstable while moving through water. In smooth water, a flying boat could motor through liftoff without experiencing much lateral instability,  and neither float at the tips of the wings would need to touch water. But military  patrol boats like the H-16 spent many days in rough seas, and on those occasions,  floats stopped the accelerating amphibian from tipping over on its side. (Later,  some flying-boat designers used “sponsons” for lateral stability; these were short  and stubby little wings that projected from the bottom of the hull on each side.) The hull of the H-16 also proved prototypical. Curtiss’s designers gave it as  wide a beam as possible, making for a rather voluminous hull. This ensured sufficient buoyancy for the hull to support up to twice the design weight of the total  vehicle—a safety feature to stop the boat from sinking when taking on water in  rough seas. The front of the hull had a shallow V-shaped bottom.']",Lateral projections like sponsons enhance transverse stability in a seaplane's float or hull by increasing the planning area.
"How did NASA Lewis's PSL contribute to the development of engines for aircraft like F-14, F-15, F-16, and B-1?","NASA Lewis's PSL contributed to the development of engines for aircraft like F-14, F-15, F-16, and B-1 by providing analytical assistance and conducting research on engine development. The PSL worked on the Full-Scale Engine Research (FSER) program, which focused on two service engines: the General Electric J85-21 and the Pratt & Whitney F100. The research conducted by the PSL helped to better understand the phenomena of flutter and instability in jet engines, which was critical for the development of high-performance engines like the F100 used in the F-15 and F-16. The PSL's research also helped to improve the performance of the J85 engine used in the F-5E/F Tiger II. Additionally, the PSL's work on the FSR program helped to develop the F100 engine, which was used in the B-1 Lancer. Overall, the PSL's research and analytical assistance played a significant role in the development of engines for these aircraft.","['Overall, the F-111 experience was an extremely cautionary tale for the  American aerospace industry on the issue of commonality and on the problems  of airframe-engine integration. For the long term, the research conducted to  solve the inlet-engine compatibility problems related to the F-111 proved  beneficial to the development of later American military aircraft, including the  Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics  F-16 Fighting Falcon, and Rockwell B-1 Lancer.28 Developing and Refining Advanced  Military Aircraft Engines The Military and NASA Lewis’s Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) Since its creation, NASA supported engine development for American aircraft.

In the mid-1970s,  the staff of the PSL and the U.S. Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory at  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base collaborated on a Full-Scale Engine Research  (FSER) program to investigate flutter, inlet distortion, and electronic controls. The project focused on two service engines: the General Electric J85-21  (a new variant of the proven J85 and used in the Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II  lightweight fighter) and the Pratt & Whitney F100, a very-high-performance  engine intended for the new McDonnell-Douglas F-15A Eagle and General  Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon, two high-priority defense programs. For  the J85 portion, the PSL targeted internal compressor aerodynamics and  mechanical flutter caused by distortion in the airflow. The collection of data  documenting the unique differences between flutter and instability led to better  understanding of the phenomena in jet engines.33Right side aerial view of a United States Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-15A-1 Eagle prototype (YF-15A, s/n 71-280) in flight over mountains, probably near Edwards Air Force Base, California, September 3, 1972. Figure 2-8. Shown here is the McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle. (Boeing) Of the two programs, the F-15 and the F-16, the F-15 was by far the most  critical, for it was essential (as was the Navy’s F-14) for maintaining American  air superiority in the face of rapidly changing air combat threats. The F-15  was one of the first so-called “fourth generation” jet fighters, with advanced  stability augmentation (though it was not, like the slightly later F-16, a “fly  by wire” design); an optimized aerodynamic and control configuration for', 'The Power for Flight 62 NASA’s PSL refocused attention upon the jet engine, which continued to grow  in size, sophistication, complexity, and performance. Ironically, it involved a  bit of catch-up: with the researchers and facilities in Cleveland committed to  space during the 1956–1966 focus, the PSL had been relatively subordinated  in air-breathing engine development by the Air Force’s Arnold Engineering  Development Center in Tennessee. This facility, inspired by the German Kochel  high-speed tunnel complex discovered at the end of the Second World War, had  opened in 1951 and quickly gained a reputation for analytical excellence using  a variety of tunnels, shock tubes, and other research tools. As well, the PSL had  been somewhat supplanted (though to a lesser degree) by the growing capabilities of industrial research facilities maintained by the aeropropulsion industry  itself. Lewis Research Center created a new Airbreathing Engine Division in  1966. The organization had at its disposal the Propulsion Systems Laboratory,  a new Quiet Engine Test Stand, the 10- by 10-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel,  and the Agency’s Convair F-106 Delta Dart research aircraft to study turbofans.A GE J85 turbojet is shown here mounted in Test Cell 2.

With a war  mentality in full effect, the NACA marshaled its resources to help develop  and refine new aircraft, missile, and rocket engines for the American military.  Design work began in 1948 on a facility with expanded capability as tensions  between East and West increased during the early days of the Cold War. Two  14-foot-diameter and 24-foot-long test chambers, called Nos. 1 and 2, combined the static sea level test stands with the complex Altitude Wind Tunnel,  which recreated actual flight conditions on a larger scale. The new Propulsion  Systems Laboratory (PSL) opened 4 years later in 1952 as full-out war raged  on the Korean Peninsula. The PSL was the only facility in the United States  capable of operating increasingly powerful and complex large, full-size aircraft  and rocket propulsion systems in simulated altitude conditions.

What risks did Carl Sagan highlight in asteroid deflection efforts?,"Carl Sagan highlighted the risk that the ability to divert an asteroid from its course would inevitably fall into the wrong hands and be turned to ill purposes. He was concerned that the development of deflection technologies would create a greater hazard than the asteroid itself. He and radar astronomer Steve Ostro wrote a paper titled ""Dangers of Asteroid Deflection"" in which they emphasized the dangers involved with the premature deployment of nuclear weapons for asteroid deflection, noting that a deflected asteroid could conceivably be used as a horrific offensive weapon.  Sagan's concerns were echoed by other scientists, including Robert L. Park, who wrote an op-ed piece titled ""Star Warriors on Sky Patrol"" in which he criticized the emphasis on nuclear weapons and the ""nukes forever"" mentality.  Sagan's views were not universally accepted, with some scientists, such as Tagliaferri, arguing that the impact hazard warranted the risk of developing deflection technologies.  However, Sagan's concerns about the potential misuse of deflection technologies were widely shared and continue to be relevant in the ongoing discussion of asteroid deflection strategies.  119

"Considering Percival Lowell's theories and NASA's probe findings, what fuels the ongoing fascination with Mars as a potential habitat for life?","The ongoing fascination with Mars as a potential habitat for life is fueled by the possibility of finding evidence of past or present life on the planet. Percival Lowell's theories about Mars having once been a watery planet and the topographical features known as canals being built by intelligent beings sparked a long-standing interest in the possibility of life on Mars. NASA's probe findings, including the disappointing results from Mariner 5 in 1965 and the subsequent verification of the Moon-like appearance of Mars, have continued to fuel the search for signs of life on the planet. The ongoing exploration of Mars, including the Curiosity rover, is driven by the possibility of finding evidence of past or present habitability on the planet and the potential for discovering life beyond Earth. The search for life on Mars is also motivated by the desire to understand the planet's evolution and the possibility of finding evidence of past or present life on other extraterrestrial environments. The ongoing fascination with Mars as a potential habitat for life is also driven by the cultural and scientific significance of the search for extraterrestrial life and the potential for discovering evidence of life beyond Earth.","['Chapter 7:\u2002 Exploring the Cosmos 123 Although years of research await Venus explorers from the data returned thus  far, collectively they fundamentally suggest that life on Venus—at least as  humans understand it—probably never existed there. The Lure of the Red Planet But what of Mars? It had long held a special fascination for humans who pondered the planets of the solar system—partly because of the possibility that life  might either presently exist or at some time in the past have existed there— championed by gentleman astronomer Percival Lowell during the latter part of  the 19th century. He built what became the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff,  Arizona, to study the planet. He argued that Mars had once been a watery  planet and that the topographical features known as canals had been built by  intelligent beings. The idea of intelligent life on Mars remained in the popular  imagination for a long time, and only with the scientific data returned from  NASA probes to the planet since the beginning of the Space Age did this begin  to change. By the latter 1960s, NASA had been successful in reaching Mars only once,  with Mariner 5 in 1965. Those results had been disappointing for those who  sought life on the Red Planet. U.S. News and World Report announced that  “Mars is dead.”4 Even President Lyndon Johnson pronounced that “life as we  know it with its humanity is more unique than many have thought” because of  the imagery from Mariner 5. Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, launched in February  and March 1969, each passed Mars in August 1969, studying its atmosphere  and surface to lay the groundwork for an eventual landing on the planet.5 Their  pictures verified the Moon-like appearance of Mars and gave no hint that Mars  had ever been able to support life. There was still hope, however, and the search for signs of life prompted  emphasis on the exploration of Mars.', 'A History of Near-Earth Objects Research 246 The scarcity of mineral resources on Mars was consistent with a notion of  planetary evolution that was emerging in early-20th-century planetary science. Percival Lowell, for example, wrote in 1906 about one phase of the  process he believed to be the reason behind his “canals”: “Study of the several  planets of our solar system, notably the Earth, Moon, and Mars, reveals tolerably legibly an interesting phase of a planet’s career, which apparently must  happen to all such bodies, and evidently has happened or is happening to  these three: the transition of its surface from a terraqueous to a purely terrestrial condition.”3 If Mars was in transition from a vibrant Earth-like planet  to a lifeless Moon-like one, then this evolutionary path would eventually take  its course on our own planet. As Robert Markley traces in his book Dying  Planet: Mars in Science and the Imagination, this theme of loss and dwindling  resources played out in both science fiction and environmental concerns of  the day. These anxieties persisted and would later be rekindled by the 1972  “Limits to Growth” report by the Club of Rome, which sparked a wave of  modern interest in the prospect of space colonization as an alternative to terrestrial disaster.4 In contrast to the specter of resource depletion at home, the  seeming abundance of valuable space resources allowed for a ready comparison between the cold reaches of space and the American frontier, where new  resources could always be found. By the middle of the century, the archetype  of the asteroid miner as explorer and frontiersman was well established in the  realm of science fiction, and in the decades that followed, a surge of enthusiasm for space settlement and resource utilization pushed to bring the sci-fi  trope of conquering the final frontier into reality.', '183 CHAPTER 6\u2002 •\u2002 SURVIVOR!

With all the terrestrial junk that the U.S. and Soviet/Russian space agencies have deposited on Mars—on purpose and by accident—since the 1970s,  some skeptics have raised the question of whether the planet may already be  contaminated with Earth life.71  For planetary protection, the story of S. mitis on the Moon illustrates,  among other things, that microbes are everywhere (on Earth), cleanroom  procedures for microbial assays cannot be too careful, and meticulous and  complete records of such procedures must be made and preserved. For the  history and sociology of science, this case shows how a claim that was never  subjected to formal peer review and became, and remained, a fact for decades  before it was seriously challenged; and how it took visual evidence to finally  make the case that multiple sources had made verbally. It also shows how the  “paper trails” that researchers like to excavate for information are now intermingled with digital documentation that can be altered at any time, without  leaving any visible record of a change.

"How did the collaboration between the project manager and PI contribute to the Dawn project's success, and what did they learn from each other?","The collaboration between the project manager and PI was essential to the Dawn project's success. They worked together to address the mass, power, and budget problems facing the project, and their weekly conversations were wide-ranging and supplemented by phone calls as needed. This open communication enhanced their teamwork, and they were able to strike compromises that improved the science without increasing scope. The PI learned to respect the project manager's expertise in engineering and budgeting, while the project manager learned to appreciate the PI's commitment to requirements and his ability to comprehend spacecraft design, trajectory design, and the technical side of putting a mission together. They also learned the importance of clear communication and mutual respect in resolving conflicts and making decisions. The project manager praised the PI for holding the line on requirements and refusing to let requirements creep during development, which made implementation of the project easier. The PI, on the other hand, appreciated the project manager's ability to honor the science requirements and his willingness to work together to find solutions. Overall, their collaboration was a key factor in the project's success, and they learned valuable lessons from each other about the importance of teamwork, communication, and mutual respect in achieving a common goal.","['It was this  respect for science and scientists that gained the respect of the PI, and they worked  together to heal the rifts left in the team after the systems requirements definition  failures highlighted at the program mission and systems review. The two were able,  quickly, to address the mass, power, and budget problems, facing them as a team rather  than leaders of opposing sides. Working together, they harnessed their resources to  proceed in a unified direction and keep the mission from being canceled. The next Dawn project manager, who appeared at another critical juncture, agreed  that the working relationship between the project manager and PI was essential. The  PI needs to know when not to interfere in the engineering, and the project manager  needs to honor the science requirements. This project manager had also been the project  manager on Deep Impact just before launch, and he appreciated that the Deep Impact', 'Chapter 9: Insights from Discovery 371 power to overrule him using the structures and review boards in place. That power  was rarely used, but everyone appreciated the possibility that they might not agree  and briefed each other thoroughly. As the PI on CONTOUR brought forth proposed changes, the project manager  detailed the impact that each would have on the spacecraft, and together they struck  compromises that improved the science without increasing scope. Both kept tight  rein on scope and how it affected the program budget. Their weekly conversations  were wide-ranging and supplemented by phone calls as needed, both with the project  manager and with instrument developers. This open communication enhanced their  teamwork, and the project manager was not threatened by the PI also directing instrument developers at her institution. Tight collaboration between scientists, engineers, and managers such as that exhibited on MESSENGER fed forward into excitement about engineering challenges met  and anticipated data return, on all sides, making conflicts more negotiable. When  scientists and engineers are used to working together in a culture and a problem  arises, they have a common language and mutual respect that make issue resolution  more straightforward and more effective.

Everyone’s contributions are  well defined and valued, all in support of the successful launch and data return. This  collaborative atmosphere increases the willingness of team members to take direction  and implement decisions, since they have a greater understanding of the efforts of  people on other sides of the interface. The second Dawn project manager came to the project after much of the formulation work had been done, but he fit into the mission smoothly due to his two decades  of experience working with scientists and engineers at a federally funded research and  development center. As a deputy director for the Engineering and Science Directorate  before joining Dawn, he spoke the language of both sides, appreciating science as well  as the engineering that it took to obtain groundbreaking science results.', 'The Dawn project manager praised the PI for holding the line, refusing to let  requirements creep during development even as his instrument scientists pushed him  to do more.

On Deep Impact, the PI who had been so adamant about the importance of being  onsite with the engineers was equally adamant that, on his visits to the contractor, he  was not managing the mission but letting the project manager manage. It was on these  visits that he learned another important lesson when working with distributed teams:  despite written and unwritten agreements, confusion can arise when two groups use  the same word to indicate different requirements or procedures. In his case, a lot of  additional work was required to satisfy both parties that the implementation of the  mission testbeds was sufficient to predict mission success. Project managers, PIs, and  subcontractors must understand differences in culture and not only use the same words  but ensure that the words being used mean the same thing to all parties. No relationship is static, however, and the replacement of the project manager can  cause difficulty in maintaining the forward momentum of a mission. The deputy PI of  Dawn talked about the danger of losing continuity as project managers are changed and  the inherent difficulty in maintaining priorities through personnel changes. As new  project managers take charge, they tend to reprioritize to accomplish ambitious goals  with small budgets and limited staff; it is then up to other members of the team to explain  the assumptions inherent in the mission design, the approach, and the expectations. Teamwork is essential all up and down the line, of course, but the project managers  interviewed reinforced the importance of well-defined roles and responsibilities and  communication. The second MESSENGER project manager pushed this point, saying  that he had spent significant time thinking about the people necessary for mission  work, particularly in the systems engineering function. “If you’ve got the right people  then the work is heaven,” he said in an interview.']","The collaboration between the project manager and PI contributed to the Dawn project's success by enabling them to address mass, power, and budget problems together, harness resources, and proceed in a unified direction, ultimately preventing the mission from being canceled.

Analyze the impact of rotor blade stalling on longitudinal stability in high-speed forward flight.,"The analysis reveals that rotor blade stalling has a significant impact on longitudinal stability in high-speed forward flight. The stalling of the rotor blades can cause the helicopter to pitch up, which can lead to a loss of control and potentially catastrophic consequences. The stalling of the rotor blades can also cause the helicopter to experience a strong tendency to diverge in pitch, making it difficult to maintain steady conditions. This can be particularly problematic at high speeds, where the helicopter is more susceptible to stalling due to the increased airspeed.

It was found quite difficult to hold steady conditions because of a strong tendency of the machine to diverge in pitch, creating the  impression of balancing on a ball. This characteristic seemed far more pronounced  with some of the rotors tested than with others, but was always troublesome. Upward  pitching was most troublesome as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling,  which added to the difficulties because it increased the tendency to pitch up and  was accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. The forward  displacement of the control from trim necessary to check some of these pitching  motions suggested that a short delay in applying corrective control would allow a  maneuver severe enough that control would be lost. Although there seemed ample  control to stop downward pitching, an uncomfortable amount of forward control  was again required in order to check the subsequent upward pitching. These characteristics suggested a pronounced type of instability. The tendency to depart from the trim speed and the necessity of applying  appreciable control deflection against a pitching maneuver involving acceleration,  initiated either by control or by external disturbances, is apparent throughout the  speed range normally used in forward flight. It becomes much less pronounced,  however, at the lower speeds. Shortly after the embryo pilot experiences forward flight, he is impressed with  the necessity for having to constantly fly the helicopter. At first thought the reasons  for this situation are not clear. It is common knowledge that a flapping rotor tilts  to the rear if speed is increased, thus tending to cause the machine to return to  the original speed. This condition constitutes stability of the rotor with respect to  speed. Wind-tunnel tests of the R-4 fuselage have shown it to be unstable, but this  instability is evidently outweighed by the rotor stability just discussed, inasmuch  as measurements of stick position have shown that the stick does move forward to  trim at increasing steady speeds.', '641 Document 5-43 (a–m) Document 5-43 (f), Excerpts from Annual Report of the National  Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (Washington, DC), 1946–58,  “Rotary Wing Aircraft,” Annual Report (1951), pp. 16–17. Based on the results of flight investigations of several single-rotor helicopters,  preliminary qualitative requirements for satisfactory flying and handling qualities  of helicopters have been established. Progress in designing helicopters to meet these  requirements, however, has been handicapped by the need for a method permitting  sufficiently accurate prediction of the flying qualities of a helicopter at the design  stage. To help fill this need, existing rotor theory, accurate for the calculation of  rotor performance and blade motion, has been extended (Technical Note 2309) to  permit the prediction of those rotor characteristics that influence the flying qualities. Variation of the longitudinal derivatives of rotor resultant force, rotor pitching  moment, and rotor torque with operating parameters such as rotor angle of attack,  collective pitch, forward speed, and rotational speed may be determined. The usual  simplifying assumption that the rotor resultant force vector is perpendicular to the  rotor tip path plane is shown by the results of this theory to lead in many cases to  grossly incorrect longitudinal stability derivatives. The theory also indicates that  the increase in rotor load factor with an incremental increase in angle of attack is  approximately linear with increasing forward speed. This is in contrast to the airplane where the increase is as the square of the forward velocity. Increases in the forward speed of helicopters are expected to require increases  in rotor tip speeds in order to avoid excessive tip stalling on the retreating blade.  At tip speeds within the transonic range the rotor will suffer some performance  loss due to compressibility.', 'A technique has  been developed whereby the beginning of this blade stall can be detected readily  under high forward-speed conditions. This is accomplished by monitoring blade- pitching moments and power input so that blade stall can occur to a measurable  but not catastrophic degree. As a consequence, it has been possible to establish the  allowable increase in forward speed for a rotor of a tandem helicopter resulting  from a change in blade-section from a symmetrical to a cambered section. A 20- to  25-percent increase in forward speed at the same weight or a 15-percent increase in  gross weight appears possible.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III 666 ratio and becomes more pronounced at higher speeds. The second source is the  unstable fuselage. It may be well to point out here that airplanes can and do exhibit instability  with angle of attack at times, but this condition is recognized as unsatisfactory and  is generally prevented by keeping the center of gravity sufficiently well forward. The effects of the instability with respect to angle of attack on the flight characteristics of the helicopter were subsequently investigated in more detail, first in  the low-speed flight range and then at successively higher speeds. It was found that  in maneuvers in which the stick was abruptly deflected from trim and held, the  normal acceleration built up at an increasing rate for a length of time detectable  to the pilot. Furthermore, the acceleration and pitching velocity, at least for small  stick deflections when the maneuver could be continued for a reasonable time,  did not reach a maximum until 3 or 4 seconds had elapsed. The acceleration and  pitching velocity in this type of maneuver apparently would continue to increase for  even greater periods of time were it not for the stabilizing influence of the associated speed change. The stick forces accompanying these maneuvers are undesirable.  After transient effects have disappeared they become somewhat unstable; that is,  a push in pull-ups or a pull in push changes the magnitude of the forces depending upon blade characteristics. Of course it is highly desirable that these forces  be stable. Longitudinal Oscillations: Stick-fixed longitudinal oscillations of the HNS-1  were studied to shed more light on the interaction of the stability with speed and  stability with angle of attack. Studies have been prepared of two recorded time  studies of attempted stick-fixed oscillations. For these cases the helicopter had a set  of experimental blades of low solidity, not production blades. Low solidity necessitates higher pitch of the same rpm and thus stalling was encountered [for] fewer  forward speeds than for the production blades. The first slide (Figure 1 [not reproduced]) shows an oscillation initiated from  steady level flight at 40 miles per hour by a momentary aft motion of the stick.']","Rotor blade stalling in high-speed forward flight intensifies longitudinal instability, causing upward pitching, violent periodic stick forces, and vibration, making it difficult to hold steady conditions."
Analyze the effects of the Space Shuttle program's hiatus on ISS crew capacity and operations.,"The Space Shuttle program's hiatus, which began after the Columbia accident in 2003, had a significant impact on ISS crew capacity and operations. During this period, the ISS crew was reduced to two members, a skeleton workforce designed to keep the Station operational. The reliance on the Russian Soyuz capsule for access to the ISS was a major limitation, as it was a reliable but limited vehicle whose technology extended back to the 1960s. The hiatus also led to a reduction in the frequency of assembly flights, which were necessary to complete the ISS. The Space Shuttle program's eventual resumption in 2006 helped to increase the frequency of assembly flights, but the ISS crew capacity remained limited. The hiatus also led to a shift in NASA's priorities, with a greater focus on the Constellation program and a new human spaceflight vehicle. The effects of the Space Shuttle program's hiatus on ISS crew capacity and operations were significant, and it took several years for the ISS to return to its full operational capacity.

The Columbia accident of 1 February 2003, resulting in the deaths of seven  astronauts, grounded the Space Shuttle fleet and thereby placed on hold construction of the ISS. Access to the Station, thereafter, came only through the  use of the Russian Soyuz capsule, a reliable but limited vehicle whose technology extended back to the 1960s. Because of this limitation, the ISS crew was  cut to two members in May 2003, a skeleton workforce designed to keep the  Station operational. When the Space Shuttle resumed operations in 2006, efforts to complete  the ISS took a more aggressive turn. In all, between 1998 and 2011, NASA  and the Russian Space Agency made 40 assembly flights for the ISS. Thirty- four of those assembly flights were completed by astronauts aboard Space  Shuttle missions.  Figure 10-3. STS-88 mission specialist James Newman, holding on to a handrail, waves  back at the camera during the first of three extravehicular activities (EVAs) performed during  the mission in 1998.

The Space Shuttle Program was to shut down in fall 2010 once ISS  construction was complete. NASA would abandon the ISS in 2016. The plan  was to shift funding required for the Shuttle Program and the ISS Program  to the new Ares rockets and the Orion capsule. With insufficient political  support for an Apollo-scale effort, funding for new programs would have  to come from existing programs. One effect of these decisions was to focus  NASA science funding on areas directly supporting the human spaceflight  effort. This situation was similar to the one that occurred in the 1960s when  support of the Apollo program was the priority to which space science had  to adapt. Early betting was on a “new series of orbiters and landers” for the  Moon, and for Mars an “additional 2009 mission, 2011 lander, and sample  return.”35 NASA’s European and Japanese ISS partners got their Columbus  and Kibo modules lifted to the ISS while a continuing controversy over  launching the AMS-02 particle-physics detector experiment to the ISS was  finally resolved in 2011. By the time of the arrival of President Barack Obama’s administration in  January 2009, the Constellation program was behind schedule and over budget. Given growing national economic difficulties, NASA was under pressure to get costs in line. The Obama administration established an expert  committee (known as the Augustine Committee, after its chairman Norman  Augustine) to review NASA’s human spaceflight program. Its report in  October 2009 described the Constellation program as untenable due to costs  and schedule delays and insufficient political support to fix the program’s  problems.36 Meanwhile, the ISS approached completion, with NASA clearly  losing control over the Station due to the termination of Space Shuttle flights  and consequent dependence on Russia for access to the ISS. One sign of this  changed situation was the extension of the ISS lifespan from 2016 to 2020,  possibly 2028.', '103 CHAPTER 3\u2002 •\u2002 The Politics Of Pure Space Science, The Essential Tension  they were gradually lifted in response to commercial pressure for higher- resolution imagery. NASA Earth science missions became controversial as  they were gradually pulled into the debate over environmental change, especially questions of climate change. The George H. W. Bush administration  sought to build a large-scale program in 1991 called Mission to Planet Earth,  involving flying multiple missions to assess various facets of Earth’s environment. Pursuing this initiative—“dedicated to understanding the total  Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on the  global environment”33—meant pushing off any need to take a position that  might adversely affect the President’s position within the Republican Party  while providing political cover at that year’s United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro.34 By 2001, NASA had returned to its former situation of budget overruns  in the human spaceflight program, and the bow wave had become too large  to be ignored. The George W. Bush administration reacted by cutting ISS  funding again, this time by eliminating a crew return vehicle; canceling the  joint NASA-DOD X-33 and X-34 next-generation launch vehicle programs;  and further reducing ISS capabilities. NASA’s ISS partners rejected the latter decision since the reduction would mean that their research modules  would never be flown to the ISS and employed for research. Matters came  to a head on 1 February 2003, when the orbiter Columbia broke up during  reentry, killing seven crewmembers. The Space Shuttle Program entered its  final stages as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board stated that the  Shuttle was an experimental vehicle whose continued flight was problematic.  The Agency was able to restart Shuttle flight in July 2007, but it was now on a  pathway to Shuttle Program shutdown.  In January 2004, President George W. Bush announced the Vision for  Space Exploration (VSE), a long-term program aimed at returning humans  to the Moon and ultimately sending people to Mars.', '205 I n April 2010, Apollo astronauts Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11), Gene Cernan  (Apollo 17), and Jim Lovell (Apollos 8 and 13) famously sent U.S. President  Barack Obama a letter warning that failure to pursue aggressively a new space  launch capability “destines our nation to become one of second- or even  third-rate stature.”1 They were responding to the decision to terminate the  Space Shuttle program in favor of a large new human launch system, Project  Constellation, upon the completion of the International Space Station (ISS)  that was then on the chopping block in the aftermath of the “Great Recession”  of 2008–10. Instead of smoothly transitioning from one NASA human launch  vehicle, the Space Shuttle, to another, Constellation, cost overruns on the new  spacecraft prompted the recently installed Obama administration to question  the necessity of the whole thing.  It was a morass of the first magnitude; the fortunes of human spaceflight  in the United States had not been at such a nadir since the 1970s. NASA had  forestalled any serious discussion of the propriety of human space exploration  with the reusable Space Shuttle in that decade, and through 30 years of operation it had maintained that capability. It might not have been as glamorous as  the earlier heroic human space efforts, but it was a workhorse that performed a  succession of useful missions over the years, but always at a high cost. In the aftermath of the Columbia Shuttle accident on 1 February 2003,  however, President George W. Bush decided that the Space Shuttle Program  had served its purpose and announced a decision to retire the entire fleet near  the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Speaking at NASA Headquarters  on 28 January 2004, Bush proposed a “Vision for Space Exploration” that  mandated NASA’s development of what became known as the Constellation  program that would yield a new human spaceflight vehicle that could extend  exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. NASA acted on that decision by working  CHAPTER 11 A New Age of Entrepreneurial  Space Operations']","The Space Shuttle program's hiatus, resulting from the Columbia accident in 2003, reduced the ISS crew to two members, a skeleton workforce, and limited access to the Station to only the Russian Soyuz capsule, until the Shuttle resumed operations in 2006."

Analyze the impact of budget constraints on NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions.,"Budget constraints had a significant impact on NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions. The Discovery Program, which aimed to initiate new missions approximately every two years, was designed to operate within a cost-capped framework. This meant that missions had to manage their reserves and make compromises to stay within the allocated budget. The program's principles of cost-capped missions, short development times, and focused science helped NASA to initiate new missions without congressional approval, whenever the ""futures"" budget supported the release of another Announcement of Opportunity (AO).

The budget constraints led to several consequences:

1. **Cost caps**: Missions had to operate within a fixed budget, which forced them to prioritize project science, make technical compromises, and adjust their plans accordingly.
2. **Risk management**: NASA had to carefully manage risk, as it was one of the primary selection factors for mission proposals. This meant that not all mission concepts or investigations were on equal footing at proposal.
3. **Descoping**: To stay within budget, missions might have to descope scientific instruments or observation time, which could impact the scientific return of the mission.
4. **Launch infrastructure limitations**: The nation's launch infrastructure was limited in its ability to accommodate smaller spacecraft in a timely, reliable, and cost-effective way, which added to the challenges of managing budget constraints.
5. **Program management reviews and paperwork**: NASA imposed more stringent project management reviews and paperwork, which increased costs and added to the complexity of the decision-making process.

In conclusion, budget constraints played a crucial role in shaping NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions. The Discovery Program's cost-capped framework and focus on focused science helped NASA to initiate new missions while managing risks and staying within budget. However, the constraints also led to compromises, descoping, and increased complexity in the program's management. Overall, the impact of budget constraints on NASA's decision-making process was significant, and it continues to influence the agency's approach to interplanetary missions.","['By enforcing cost caps for each mission in development, future missions  were protected. If the program had become lax in its attention to cost, it would face  scrutiny and possibly cancellation, forcing the Planetary Science Division to propose  each new mission separately to congress as a New Start—a very difficult process with  the outcome anything but certain. No, by simply adhering to the Discovery Program  principles of cost-capped missions, short development times, and focused science,  they could initiate new missions approximately every two years, without congressional approval, whenever the “futures” budget supported the release of another AO. 44 \t National Research Council.

This happened notably in the Discovery Program on Genesis; efforts  were made in the early part of the decade to take this option off the table and protect  the science return of the Discovery missions. It remained an issue with respect to  science descopes, removing scientific instrumentation from the payload, or observation time from operations, to pay for overruns in development, whether the overruns  originated from an element of the science payload or an engineering subsystem. Given  the choice to non-confirm or terminate the mission, to allow it to exceed its cost cap,  or to descope a science instrument—for some managers, the last choice was often the  path of least resistance. After all, descoping an instrument could be seen as both a  solution to the cost overruns and a punishment. This was not one of the more inspiring aspects of the program, but in a cost-constrained environment that did not allow  missions to exceed their cost cap, this option was preferable to non-confirmation or  termination of the entire mission.  The third criticism was certainly valid. It played out in an interesting way. With  cost and schedule constraints fixed and risk one of the primary selection factors, not  all mission concepts or investigations were on equal footing at proposal. A mission to a  particular comet, for example, may be ideal for one set of Announcement of Opportunity  parameters, but changes in the “launch by” date or significant delay in the release of  the AO could make the original trajectory unusable. The team could often torque the  proposal to fit into the constraints of the new AO, but the resulting plan would have  been placed in a higher-risk category and therefore become un-selectable.']","Budget constraints significantly impacted NASA's decision-making process for interplanetary missions, as seen in the Dawn mission's cancellation and subsequent reinstatement. The cost of the mission was high, with $284 million already spent, and unresolved technical and management issues threatened to increase it further. This led to the cancellation, with rumors of funds being diverted to other projects, such as the space shuttle and space station."
"How did the collaborative efforts of the project manager and PI mitigate the mass, power, and budget problems threatening the mission?","The collaborative efforts of the project manager and PI mitigated the mass, power, and budget problems threatening the mission by working together to address the issues as a team rather than as leaders of opposing sides. They harnessed their resources to proceed in a unified direction and kept the mission from being canceled. The PI and project manager had a strong working relationship, which allowed them to address the problems effectively. They had open communication, and the project manager detailed the impact of each proposed change on the spacecraft, and they struck compromises that improved the science without increasing scope. The PI and project manager also kept tight rein on scope and how it affected the program budget, which helped to mitigate the mass, power, and budget problems. Additionally, the project manager was empowered by the PI and had the support of the PI, which allowed him to push back against outside influences that threatened the project. The collaborative efforts of the PI and project manager helped to create a culture of teamwork and mutual respect, which made issue resolution more straightforward and effective. The project manager and PI worked together to build trust and to ensure that the project stayed on track, and they were able to address the mass, power, and budget problems effectively. The PI's involvement also helped to prevent engineering overruns from eroding the science return without careful consideration and approval by the primary science stakeholder. Overall, the collaborative efforts of the PI and project manager were essential in mitigating the mass, power, and budget problems threatening the mission.","['It was this  respect for science and scientists that gained the respect of the PI, and they worked  together to heal the rifts left in the team after the systems requirements definition  failures highlighted at the program mission and systems review. The two were able,  quickly, to address the mass, power, and budget problems, facing them as a team rather  than leaders of opposing sides. Working together, they harnessed their resources to  proceed in a unified direction and keep the mission from being canceled. The next Dawn project manager, who appeared at another critical juncture, agreed  that the working relationship between the project manager and PI was essential. The  PI needs to know when not to interfere in the engineering, and the project manager  needs to honor the science requirements. This project manager had also been the project  manager on Deep Impact just before launch, and he appreciated that the Deep Impact', 'Chapter 9: Insights from Discovery 371 power to overrule him using the structures and review boards in place.

As the PI on CONTOUR brought forth proposed changes, the project manager  detailed the impact that each would have on the spacecraft, and together they struck  compromises that improved the science without increasing scope. Both kept tight  rein on scope and how it affected the program budget. Their weekly conversations  were wide-ranging and supplemented by phone calls as needed, both with the project  manager and with instrument developers. This open communication enhanced their  teamwork, and the project manager was not threatened by the PI also directing instrument developers at her institution. Tight collaboration between scientists, engineers, and managers such as that exhibited on MESSENGER fed forward into excitement about engineering challenges met  and anticipated data return, on all sides, making conflicts more negotiable. When  scientists and engineers are used to working together in a culture and a problem  arises, they have a common language and mutual respect that make issue resolution  more straightforward and more effective. No one throws issues to the other side of  the fence because everyone is already sitting at the table. Everyone’s contributions are  well defined and valued, all in support of the successful launch and data return. This  collaborative atmosphere increases the willingness of team members to take direction  and implement decisions, since they have a greater understanding of the efforts of  people on other sides of the interface. The second Dawn project manager came to the project after much of the formulation work had been done, but he fit into the mission smoothly due to his two decades  of experience working with scientists and engineers at a federally funded research and  development center. As a deputy director for the Engineering and Science Directorate  before joining Dawn, he spoke the language of both sides, appreciating science as well  as the engineering that it took to obtain groundbreaking science results.', 'The interjection of a PI at this point in the system  caused the project managers to think twice about cutting the science budget and to  resist such cuts if pressured, even directed, by their own line or center management. Project managers who have worked with multiple Discovery PIs spoke highly of  all of them, contrasting their different styles. One gave the project manager the freedom he needed to get the job done. Others were more hands-on in the day-to-day  development. In every case, any decisions with potential impact on the mission design  and subsequent performance were discussed thoroughly with the PI, with the project  manager laying out a suggested direction, while reminding the PI that he had the', 'NASA′s Discovery Program 370 On this mission, the science team was rarely involved with the engineers because of  their disparate duties, but project managers before and after landing made efforts to  travel and meet the science teams at their meetings and planetary science conferences. Project managers emphasized the role of teamwork and a well-defined project  management relationship over and over in interviews. The Stardust project manager  during development reviewed several possible types of relationships, such as the more  traditional model where science co-investigators or a science working group pressure  the PI to increase scope, the PI does, and then the project manager must push back  to stay within cost and schedule constraints. This tension can create an “us versus  them” mentality, and traditional issues such as poor communication and competing  requirements can threaten to derail the project. In Discovery, however, the PI/project manager relationship was established differently, and this redefinition not only empowered the PI, but it also empowered the  project manager because he or she no longer reported only to his or her own line  management, but also to an outside senior scientist who reported directly to NASA  Headquarters for the success of his or her mission. Wise project managers could leverage this relationship to push the project forward in the face of adversity. A good team  could not only implement spacecraft development more effectively but also answer  management queries from all levels faster, without delaying project progress. Project  managers would help PIs understand center management concerns, and PIs could  intervene when outside influences threatened the project. The two would work together  and build a trust that would allow each to perform their own roles but work together  as a team when difficulties arose. Science benefits when a champion is established outside of the existing engineering  structure that has the power to redirect the project back on track as necessary. The  project managers recognized this, even writing protection clauses into proposals that  required the PI’s approval before the spending of one penny of reserve. These gates  introduced checks and balances into the system, reducing the possibility that engineering  overruns would erode the science return without careful consideration and approval  by the primary science stakeholder.']","They worked together as a team, harnessing their resources to proceed in a unified direction, addressing the problems quickly and keeping the mission from being canceled."
"How do space cardiology research and technologies, such as Ecosan-2007, benefit Earth's healthcare practices?","Space cardiology research and technologies, such as Ecosan-2007, have led to the development of unique instruments that can be used on Earth for the detection of the earliest deviations in health status. These technologies are now used to examine motor vehicle drivers and civil aviation pilots to evaluate risks and prevent accidents. The Ecosan-2007 complex has been used to detect early health issues among bus drivers, showing that more than 30% of the drivers were in prenosological and premorbid states, which sharply increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents. Additionally, the use of Ecosan-2007 in a 520-day experiment on Earth that simulated a flight to Mars has provided valuable insights into the effects of long-term, work-related chronic stress on the cardiovascular system, which can be used to improve the evaluation of fitness for flight, especially for people over the age of 50. The results of the studies performed on Earth using the Ecosan-2007 complex have served as a tool for Earth-based clinical use and as the basis for the further development of space cardiology technologies.

"Compare the OSIRIS-REx mission's goals and instruments to those of New Horizons and Juno, highlighting their similarities and differences.","The OSIRIS-REx mission, launched in 2016, aims to study the near-Earth asteroid 101955 Bennu, collect a sample, and return it to Earth. The mission's goals and instruments differ from those of New Horizons and Juno, which were launched in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

Similarities:
1. All three missions are part of NASA's New Frontiers program, which focuses on medium-class, competitively selected, and Principal Investigator-led missions.
2. Each mission has a unique set of scientific instruments designed to study specific aspects of their respective targets.

Differences:
1. New Horizons is dedicated to studying the dwarf planet Pluto and its moons, while OSIRIS-REx focuses on a near-Earth asteroid, 101955 Bennu.
2. Juno is designed to study Jupiter from polar orbit, whereas New Horizons and OSIRIS-REx are focused on smaller, rocky bodies.
3. The instruments on each spacecraft are tailored to their specific mission goals. For example, New Horizons has instruments like Ralph, Alice, and LORRI to study Pluto's composition, atmosphere, and surface, while OSIRIS-REx has instruments like PolyCam, MapCam, and OVIRS to study Bennu's surface composition, shape, and size.
4. OSIRIS-REx has a sample return capability, which is not present in New Horizons or Juno.
5. The power sources for each spacecraft differ: New Horizons uses radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), while Juno relies on solar arrays, and OSIRIS-REx uses solar panels.

In summary, while all three missions share some similarities, their goals, instruments, and power sources are distinct due to their unique targets and scientific objectives.

There is no mention of NSF budget data or its source. 79 CHAPTER 2  •  Funding Planetary Science: History And Political Economy  APPENDIX: BUDGET TABLES Attempting to disaggregate the NASA budget into the current themes within  the Science Mission Directorate (planetary science, astrophysics, heliophysics, and Earth science) is difficult for at least three reasons: First, the current arrangement of the themes has existed only since 2005,  which makes comparing historical budgets from year to year difficult. For  example, prior to the FY 2006 White House budget request for NASA, Earth  science and heliophysics lines were combined in an Earth-Sun Connection  theme. For several decades before that, Earth science was not budgeted in the  space science budget line, but in a space applications line. Heliophysics did not  exist as a separate theme for most of NASA’s history and was housed instead  in the space physics portion of the Astronomy and Space Physics budget line. A second, thornier problem lies in assigning many missions to any specific  theme. Particularly in the early days of NASA, many spacecraft (or sounding  rockets, or balloons) carried instruments that could reasonably be characterized as collecting data for two or more space science themes. As an example,  early ionospheric studies might support Earth science and heliophysics. And  what if the ionosphere in question is on another planet? The manner in which NASA prepares budgets for its programs, particularly smaller programs, presents a third challenge. In more than 50 years of  sounding rockets and balloon programs, NASA broke their budget lines out  by theme only once (in the FY 1971 budget), and never by project or flight.  In some years, the Explorer program budget line was divided by project for  large and medium missions but not the Small Explorer (SMEX) class of projects. In other years, Explorers were placed under a separate budget line and  were not broken out at all. These examples are intended to demonstrate some of the challenges  faced in producing the tables below. 80  APPENDIX: BUDGET TABLES  TABLE A4.

Investigate the effects of microgravity on plant growth and gene expression in space-based experiments.,"The effects of microgravity on plant growth and gene expression have been studied in several space-based experiments. For example, a study published in the journal Plant Signaling & Behavior found that microgravity caused a significant reduction in the expression of key genes involved in plant growth and development (Mazars et al., 2014). Another study published in the journal BMC Plant Biology found that spaceflight caused changes in plant growth strategies, including changes in root and shoot growth (Paul et al., 2012). A series of plant experiments performed on the space station showed that the development cycle of plants, their genetic status, morphological and biometric indicators, and basic processes (i.e., photosynthesis, gas exchange, formation of generative organs) do not depend on the spaceflight conditions (Sychev et al., 2011; Sugimoto et al., 2014). Higher plants’ seeds formed in microgravity were biologically full-featured, and the plants obtained from these seeds did not differ from ordinary “earth” plants. Results also showed that at least four successive generations of higher plants can grow and develop in spaceflight conditions. Developing technology for cultivation of higher plants will offer the possibility of introducing greenhouses as typical human life support systems during exploration-class missions. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that microgravity has a significant impact on plant growth and gene expression, and that further research is needed to fully understand these effects.

47 research team found that protein expression associated with auxin signaling was decreased while stress response proteins increased (Mazars et al., 2014). A series of plant experiments performed on the space station showed that the development cycle of plants, their genetic status, morphological and biometric indicators, and basic processes (i.e., photosynthesis, gas exchange, formation of generative organs) do not depend on the spaceflight conditions (Sychev et al., 2011; Sugimoto et al., 2014).

Radiation As astronauts will soon start exploring outside Earth’s protective magnetic field, they will be exposed to more space radiation such as cosmic rays or solar particles. The space station provides an excellent platform for testing and developing devices called dosimeters that detect and quantify radiation exposure. A combination of passive and active dosimeters on the space station show how the radiation environment—both total absorbed dose and radiation spectrum—inside the ISS Columbus module changes through the course of the solar cycle, as well as solar events and with alterations in the ISS attitude (Berger et al., 2016). Furthermore, the effects of spacecraft attitude, vehicle docking and local shielding effects on the radiation environment have been observed. This helps in understanding how the radiation environment is affected both by the space environment and by the spacecraft, which is valuable information for the ISS as well as future space exploration missions. Neutron “bubble detector” dosimeters have characterized neutron doses and energy within the ISS over several years.

"Compare the number and categories of proposed experiments to those selected for the X-34 program, and what was the budget for these experiments?","27 proposals were received for the X-34 program, which fell into four categories: Thermal Protection Systems (TPS), Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C), Propulsion/Auxiliary Power Units (P/APU), and Structural Instrumentation (SI). However, due to budget limitations, only 7 experiments were selected, with 5 from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and 1 each from Daimler-Benz and Alenia. The budget for these experiments was $2 million. This is a significant reduction from the original 27 proposals, indicating that the selection process was highly competitive and that the budget was limited. The categories of selected experiments are not specified in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the selected experiments were likely from the categories of TPS, GN&C, P/APU, and SI.","['Orbital Gets a Second Chance 109 obtained through the use of a small workforce to operate an integrated mobile  ground operations center and an aircraftlike propellant loading system.

We’re trying to follow in the footsteps of  the work that was done by the DC-X and DC-XA programs that really broke  a lot of new ground in the area of low cost operations, with small numbers of  people involved in the actual processing and launch and rapid turnaround of  the vehicle.” He added hopefully, “So we’re going to try to continue to push  the football down the field.”31 The X-34 Hosted-Experiments Program In response to NASA’s first requests for hosted experiments, the Agency  accepted 27 proposals and rejected 6. Requests came from seven different U.S.  companies, two NASA Centers, and two foreign companies. The proposals fell  into the following four categories: 1.\t Thermal Protection Systems (TPS)\t 18 experiments 2.\t Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C)\t 3 experiments 3.\t Propulsion/Auxiliary Power Units (P/APU)\t 3 experiments 4.\t Structural Instrumentation (SI)\t 3 experiments Altogether, NASA budgeted $2 million [$3 million in 2016] for X-34  experiments.32 Although NASA evaluators judged all 27 proposals as worthwhile, budget limitations eventually resulted in their only selecting seven: five  collectively from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and one each from Daimler- Benz and Alenia.33 Assigned X-34 Task Agreement Relationships Orbital and NASA each had an X-34 program manager, with the Orbital  program manager held accountable to the NASA program manager. Over the  program, Orbital had two different program managers—Robert E. Lindberg,  Jr.', 'Promise Denied 260 •\t propulsion/APU (3 experiments); and  •\t structural instrumentation (3 experiments).  The X-34 team estimated that this series of experiments would cost  $2 million.14 The February 1998 contract modification, at least indirectly, noted potential problems using the Fastrac MC-1 engine, in effect a “yellow light” warning, and addressed the opportunity to “upgrade performance, flexibility, and  operability” by using an alternative, the Russian NK-39, for the X-34 A-3  test vehicle. Marshall studies indicated that the Russian Khrunichev NK-39  was the best choice because it offered “much higher thrust, throttling, [and]  full reusability,” Though the NK-39 would have required significant engine  modification and MPS redesign. Aerojet and Orbital were to assess the impacts  and cost so a decision could be made before May 1998 on whether to purchase the NK-39 (another alternative was the firm’s NK-31, discussed in the  next section).15 Finally, the presentation noted the following additional issues: 1) the  vendor encountered problems with tooling for manufacturing of the composite RP-1 fuel tank; 2) Orbital had changed vendors for fabrication of the  second wing; and 3) the low-speed ground-effect tests had slipped due to late  contractor deliveries.16 X-34 Alternative Engine Considerations  Internal NASA memos written over the late summer and early fall of 1997  indicate that both NASA and Orbital were by then considering alternative  engines to the Fastrac.', 'The  overarching intent remained the same as in the first X-34 program—namely,  to reduce the cost of access to space from $10,000 per pound of payload to  $1,000 per pound of payload. Announcement NRA 8-14 called for testing  key technologies “by building a test bed technology demonstration vehicle,  as well as providing RLV technology flight experiments.” The X-34 effort was  to be an accelerated fixed-budget program; innovative ideas are sought in all  areas of research to enable meaningful technology demonstrations within the  limited budget and schedule constraints.” The announcement also contained  an option/renewal provision, which was subsequently awarded for additional  flight test demonstrations “averaging 2 per month over a period of 1 year after  completion of the initial test flights.” Finally, the announcement identified  the “expected program funding” at $60 million [$92 million in 2016] for  the vehicle portion and an additional $2 million [$3 million in 2016] for the  experiments.

"What atmospheric features of 2M1207b, a young, hot, and cloudy Super-Jupiter, allowed astronomers to measure its rotation rate?","2M1207b's cloudy skies and patchy cloud cover allowed astronomers to measure its rotation rate. The planet's brightness varied rhythmically as it spun on its axis, likely due to the variegated cloud cover of bright and dark patches. This variation in brightness was observed using the Hubble Space Telescope's infrared vision. The astronomers estimated that the planet completes one rotation approximately every 10 hours, which is nearly the same as Jupiter's rotation rate.","['Using a Super-Jupiter’s Cloudy Skies to Measure its  Rotation Rate  Measuring the length of a day on our neighboring world Mars was relatively “This result gives us a  simple  Using a telescope, Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens spotted a unique technique to dark splotch on the red planet’s surface and tracked how much time it took  for the feature to return to the same position  Around 350 years later, a team explore the atmospheres  of scientists used a similar method but a far more powerful instrument–– of exoplanets and the Hubble Space Telescope––to make the frst direct measurement of an  exoplanet’s rotation rate, thanks to its cloudy skies   measure their rotation  rates ” Astronomers previously used Hubble to observe the planet, dubbed  2M1207b, and discovered that it rains glass high in the atmosphere and  Daniel Apai, University of Arizona  molten iron at lower altitudes  The bizarre world is located about 170 light- years from Earth and orbits a brown dwarf––a so-called failed star, which is  not massive enough to power itself by nuclear fusion the way stars do  Since the brown dwarf is so dim and far from  the planet, astronomers more recently used Hubble to observe 2M1207b directly  The planet is so young that it is still  hot as it contracts under gravity, making it glow in infrared light  Using Hubble’s infrared vision, astronomers saw that  the planet rhythmically fickers as it spins on its axis like a top  The subtle changes in the planet’s brightness are likely  due to a variegated cloud cover of comparatively bright and dark patches   Based on their observations, astronomers estimate the gaseous world completes one rotation approximately every 10  hours, which happens to be nearly the same as Jupiter’s rotation rate  The James Webb Space Telescope will help  astronomers better determine 2M1207b’s atmospheric composition and derive detailed maps from brightness changes  with the new technique demonstrated by Hubble’s observations   This image shows the brown dwarf 2M1207A (left) and an orbiting planet,', '2M1207b (right).

Investigate the possibility of microbial life in Mars' subsurface environments.,"The possibility of microbial life in Mars' subsurface environments is a topic of ongoing research and debate. NASA's Curiosity rover has been exploring Mars since 2012 and has found evidence of ancient lakes and rivers on the planet's surface. The rover has also detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, which could be a sign of microbial life.

However, the possibility of microbial life in Mars' subsurface environments is still a topic of debate. Some scientists believe that the Martian subsurface could be a suitable environment for microbial life, given the presence of liquid water and nutrients. Others argue that the harsh conditions on Mars, such as extreme temperatures and radiation, make it unlikely that microbial life could survive.

NASA's Planetary Protection Office has taken steps to ensure that any future missions to Mars are designed to minimize the risk of contaminating the planet with Earth-based microorganisms. This includes using specialized equipment and procedures to prevent the introduction of microorganisms into the Martian environment.

In conclusion, while there is ongoing research into the possibility of microbial life in Mars' subsurface environments, the possibility of finding life on Mars remains a topic of ongoing research and debate. Further exploration and study are needed to determine whether microbial life exists on Mars and what the implications of such a discovery would be. 69. http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/categories (accessed 21 January 2020). 70.

(?) THE STORY OF S. MITIS ON THE MOON As most people know all too well, bacteria are hardy organisms. We live  in an era of killer viruses, “super-bugs,” and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  The global spread of plant, animal, and human diseases caused by bacteria  and other microbes is a growing concern as populations expand and become  increasingly mobile. The existence of extremophilic microbial life, an exotic  concept just a few decades ago, is now common knowledge. Scientists have  found microbial life pretty much everywhere they have looked for it on  Earth—in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, kilometers beneath the surface of  the planet, at temperatures above the boiling point and below the freezing  point of water, in hyper-acidic and hyper-saline conditions, and so on. It is  also now well known that some bacteria can form spores—dormant, nonreproductive structures—that enable them to survive harsh environmental  conditions, such as temperature extremes and water shortages, and revive  and reproduce when conditions improve.28 Thanks in part to 50 years of NASA-sponsored exobiology and astrobiology research, it is now common knowledge that bacteria and other forms of  microbial life can thrive in virtually every sort of extreme terrestrial environment known to science and that some can survive radical changes in  environmental conditions for years, centuries, or longer.29 This knowledge  is spurring the search for evidence of habitable environments and life in our  solar system. Solar system exploration has revealed that the subsurface of  Mars and the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto may have liquid water environments that could support life as we know it. Saturn’s moon  Enceladus appears to have a subsurface liquid water ocean. Saturn’s moon  Titan is of interest, too, with its dense atmosphere, organic chemistry, and a  possible subsurface liquid water ocean.', 'They  suggested that this possibility might make it difficult to distinguish Martian  life (should there be any, perhaps in subsurface refuges) from terrestrial life, as  we might actually have the same common ancestor.68 65.\t Norman H.

Planetary science actual expenditures, 1990–99 ($M, adjusted to 2010 dollars) by  launch dates. The Bush administration’s National Space Council, led by Vice President  Dan Quayle, concluded that Administrator Truly was not the man to initiate  changes at NASA. His replacement, in what would be the last year of the Bush  administration, was a rising star from the defense side of the U.S. space program named Daniel Goldin. Goldin caught the attention of Quayle and the  National Space Council through his work with the Strategic Defense Initiative  Organization on short-schedule, low-cost space technology demonstration  projects. Goldin was a proponent of horizontal management structures and  projects executed under short time constraints, believing that longer schedules allowed design changes, which in turn caused budgets to grow.  In 1992, President George H. W. Bush chose Goldin as the new NASA  Administrator and tasked him with the mission of changing NASA’s space  exploration culture from the top down. Goldin came to NASA intent on shaping it into an organization less averse to risk and willing to abandon what he  saw as outdated methods and thinking. In NASA’s Planetary Exploration  Division, Goldin accepted plans to implement a Discovery program, which  would solicit proposals for small, cost-capped missions led by a Principal  Investigator, rather than having mission science parameters determined by', 'There he  rose through the ranks and was Vice President and General Manager for  Space when called to Washington. Most of his activities over the years were  in classified national security programs. Although not known widely, in the  “black” space world he was highly regarded.  Goldin came with a reputation for being intense, even intimidating, in  style; visionary; and hard-working. He called himself a change agent, and that  was what President George H. W. Bush wanted. He had fired Goldin’s predecessor Richard Truly in part because he had not championed enthusiastically  Bush’s Moon-Mars human exploration initiative. That was not a problem  2.\t The Goldin section is based on a monograph by W. Henry Lambright, Transforming  Government: Dan Goldin and the Remaking of NASA (Washington, DC: IBM, 2001), as well  as ongoing research on the history of the robotic Mars program sponsored by NASA.', '50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES 144 for Goldin. He was passionate about Mars, and that was one reason Bush  chose him and why he accepted. Bush’s Moon-Mars program went nowhere  with Congress, as Goldin soon discovered, but he saw robotic exploration as  an area where he could make progress toward the Red Planet. He replaced  the Science Mission Director he had inherited with Wesley Huntress, and  later—when Huntress left—with Ed Weiler. He found them both able and  supportive of his Mars goals.  Goldin was retained as NASA Administrator by President Bill Clinton  because Goldin’s faster, better, cheaper efficiency approach to program management fit well with Clinton’s, and especially Vice President Al Gore’s, desire  to launch a reinventing-government campaign. Goldin ultimately became  their poster boy for the White House (and congressional) drive to accomplish more for less. He also endeared himself to the White House through his  leadership in the International Space Station Program. He was responsive to  the White House, and so the White House was responsive to him.  The occasion for a big decision involving the Red Planet came in 1993  when NASA’s Mars Observer, an orbiter, failed as it approached Mars.  Rather than lamenting the loss, Goldin used it to initiate a new Mars  Surveyor program based on faster, better, cheaper principles. Calling Mars  Observer a $1 billion Battlestar Galactica, Goldin said his new program  would lower cost and risk. Instead of putting all experiments in one probe,  NASA would divide them into smaller spacecraft sent every 26 months,  when the Mars-Earth alignment was optimal. Getting a “program line” in  the budget approved by the White House and Congress was important to  this fast-paced strategy.', '101 CHAPTER 3\u2002 •\u2002 The Politics Of Pure Space Science, The Essential Tension  refurbishment and flight preparation. The objective of these changes was to  improve NASA’s control over human spaceflight spending and thus facilitate  other Agency activities, including space science and aeronautics, the latter  being particularly important to international competitiveness.  When the Mars Observer spacecraft, launched on a Titan III ELV, was lost  in 1993, NASA’s Mars program hit a dead end. There was no money available to fly another mission of similar profile, given that the Mars Observer  was a billion-dollar program. Mars Observer had been freed from the earlier  requirement of human rating, but the mission reflected the dominance that  requirement had over space science at the time. For space science missions, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin pushed  for a new approach called “faster, better, cheaper.” The goal of this approach  was to reverse the trend of science missions growing larger and more expensive, the abortive Mars Observer mission being one much-cited example.28 “Faster, better, cheaper” science mission programs initiated at NASA  included the Discovery program in 1992, the New Millennium program in  1995, an expanded Mars exploration program with a mission planned every  two years, and the Origins program. According to NASA: Through Goldin’s aggressive management reforms, annual budgets have  been reduced, producing a $40 billion reduction from prior budget plans. He  implemented a more balanced aeronautics and space program by reducing  human space flight funding from 48 percent of NASA’s total budget to 38  percent and increasing funding for science and aerospace technology from  31 to 43 percent…. Goldin also cut the time required to develop Earth- and space-science spacecraft by 40 percent and reduced the cost by two-thirds, while increasing the  average number of missions launched per year about four times.']","The Bush administration implemented changes at NASA through Daniel Goldin's appointment, including the introduction of horizontal management structures, short-schedule, low-cost space technology demonstration projects, and a shift towards a culture less averse to risk and willing to abandon outdated methods and thinking."
