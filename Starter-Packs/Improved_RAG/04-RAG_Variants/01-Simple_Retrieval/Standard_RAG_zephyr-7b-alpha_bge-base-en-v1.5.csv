Koelle of Deutsche Aerospace provided the following \nbackground summary: \nThe key problem in the past was performance, resulting in four-\nstage or three-stage launch vehicles. The introduction of liquid \nhydrogen/liquid oxygen for upper stages reduced the number of \nstages required for LEO [low-Earth orbit] to two, and today we \nare working towards single-stage vehicles. \nThere is still much discussion of whether SSTOs are feasible. \nThis concept doubtless represents the ultimate solution, however, \nbeyond feasibility it must be economically competitive also.\nThe optimum system solution also depends on the transporta\xad\ntion task. In the same way we find different types of vehicles on \nground like cars, busses and trucks, there are different optimal \nconcepts for space transportation…. In parallel we see the advent \nof winged launch systems (as suggested by the late Prof. [Eugen] \nSänger already in 1932). The air-launched Pegasus on the one \nhand, as well as re-entry gliders like the Shuttle Orbiter or the \nEuropean Hermes Project on the other hand can be considered as \nforerunners of future two-stage and finally eventually single-stage \nwinged vehicles.67 \nIn the United Kingdom, Reaction Engines Limited has been working \non development plans for the Skylon reusable launch vehicle. According to \nthe company, the Skylon is “an unpiloted, reusable spaceplane intended to \nprovide reliable, responsive and cost-effective access to space.”68 In regard to \nChina’s developmental effort, while few details are available, popular litera\xad\nture suggests that China is developing an experimental vehicle resembling \nthe X-34. Reputedly named Shenlong (“Divine Dragon”), it is intended \nfor air-launch from a modified Xian H-6 bomber (the Chinese-produced \nderivation of the Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-16 Badger), in the same fashion that \nthe United States’ North American X-15 was air-launched from a Boeing \nNB-52 Stratofortress. \nIn early 2001, Teal Group analyst Marco Antonio Cáceres commented on \nthe reusable launch vehicle programs then underway worldwide by noting that \n[t]here are roughly a dozen reusable launch vehicle (RLV) devel\xad\nopment efforts worldwide, including a few Russian and European \nprograms for which there [is] little information. Most of these \nprograms are not much farther along than the concept design', 'Promise Denied\n14\ninnovative arrangements between the U.S. Government and the private sector, \nincluding state and local governments. The Department of Defense and NASA \nwere directed to plan for the transition between space programs and future \nlaunch systems in a manner that would ensure continuity of mission capability \nand accommodate transition costs. They also were directed to combine their \nexpendable launch service requirements into single procurements, when such \nprocurements would result in cost savings or otherwise accrue advantages to the \nGovernment.35 Finally, the policy directive noted that “[i]t is envisioned that \nthe private sector could have a significant role in managing the development \nand operation of a new reusable space transportation system. In anticipation \nof this role, NASA shall actively involve the private sector in planning and \nevaluating its launch technology activities.”36 \nNASA and the Winged-Body RLV Concept\nFrom April 1994 to January 1995, NASA and several of its industry partners \nconducted a study to analyze the winged-body single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) \nreusable launch vehicle (RLV) concept. The stated primary objectives of the \noverall studies were to develop a better technical understanding of three dif\xad\nferent design concepts—winged-body, vertical-lander, and lifting-body—and \na consistent set of ground rules for an applicable upper stage. A consistent set \nof ground rules was necessary in order to perform an equitable comparison \nof the three different concepts that were based on different ground rules and \nassumptions. The analytical results of the study also were intended to establish \nthe targets required for the technology program. The study team believed that \nonce a standard set of ground rules and assumptions was established, the pros \nand cons of each concept could be weighed to furnish answers to fundamen\xad\ntal questions relating to system weight (always a critical and sensitive issue), \ntechnology targets, and requirements change or “creep.” The study team asked \nthese questions, among others:37\n•\t How well do NASA’s preliminary sizing tools predict vehicle \nperformance? \n•\t Are all issues correctly understood? \n•\t Are the right technologies being pursued? \n•\t Is emphasis being placed on the right technologies?\n•\t How can NASA measure the technology maturation? \n•\t How would requirements impact size, engine choice, and required \nmaterials? \nInitial Analysis\nBased on the availability of data, the winged-body (WB 001) concept was the \nfirst established reference configuration, to be followed by the vertical-lander', 'Promise Denied\n350\nbeen developed for X-34,” and concluded, “that meets program requirements, \nsupports mission operations, and will demonstrate key RLV [reusable launch \nvehicle] technologies. The design has been completed and a successful CDR \n[Critical Design Review] has been held. The system is now in the manufactur\xad\ning and testing phase.”62\nIn another paper presented at the same conference, R. H. Champion, Jr., \nand Richard J. Darrow, Jr. (a co-author on the previously noted paper noted \nregarding program accomplishments), enumerated six lessons learned:\n1.\t the main propulsion system Program design team should not have \nbeen brought up to full staff level until the system design freeze \nwas\xa0completed;\n2.\t a significant number of subsystem components were changed between \nthe “rough order of magnitude” bids from vendors and the final nego\xad\ntiations and contract agreements, thus causing significant rework by \nthe designers and analysts; \n3.\t the initial design drawings were not vendor specific, thus causing \nnecessary changes to be made in order to reduce cost and improve \ndelivery time;\n4.\t the use of a common CAD system is a requirement for a program \nwhere there are numerous interface concerns between two organiza\xad\ntions (In the case of the X-34, the Orbital and NASA Marshall CAD \nmodels were always out of sync by a few weeks);\n5.\t the suppliers of the design and analysis should have formal notifica\xad\ntion and acknowledgment on all changes to specifications, interface \ndrawings, and other engineering change notices that impact the sub\xad\nsystems, otherwise the supplier will inevitably get out of sync with the \nprime contractor; and\n6.\t in an experimental flight program, with a compressed schedule and \nconcurrent engineering, changes are inevitable, therefore, the teams \nthat survive are the ones that learn how to adjust to this pace and \nenvironment.63', 'Promise Denied\n120\n24.\tDelma C.

"Question: What was the role of the flying boat in aviation development before 1940, and how did it contribute to military and commercial power projection?","The flying boat played a significant role in aviation development before 1940, contributing to military and commercial power projection. It was a form of aircraft that enjoyed its heyday prior to 1945, during which most experts felt that these aircraft would make many fundamental and long-lasting contributions to aviation. Commercial, military, and government establishments dedicated substantial resources to their development, and as aircraft technologies progressed generally, the form of the airship and the flying boat improved as well. Both types contributed to aviation's projection of military and commercial power in the pre–World War II era, launching a number of airline routes, including the first transoceanic ones. The Clipper flying boats pioneered the transport services to Hawaii, the Philippines, China, South America, and Europe.

However, by the 1930s, the flying boat's inherent size and hull form had become a significant limitation, preventing it from fully taking advantage of rapid strides in aerodynamic design. This penalty had not allowed the flying boat to compete with the land plane in terms of performance and utility. To address this issue, a study was initiated to investigate the possibilities of improvement through redesign, with the aim of achieving marked improvement in hull form and hydrodynamic sustention using a currently practical airplane design of 180,000 pounds gross weight as an example.

The study resulted in ten proposals, which can be roughly divided into two basic categories: single hull and twin hull. These proposals are intended to show basic trends and not to reflect a definite design. The more promising designs or combinations of designs will be studied in more detail, leading to a sound, specific design proposal.

In conclusion, while the flying boat played a significant role in aviation development before 1940, its limitations in terms of size and hull form prevented it from fully taking advantage of advances in aerodynamic design. However, efforts are being made to address these limitations through redesign, with the aim of achieving marked improvement in hull form and hydrodynamic sustention.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n28\ncarried no more than two dozen passengers and had to make intermediate stops \nfor\xa0refueling.\nDocuments 5-13 through 5-24 will reproduce a number of reports, articles, \nletters, and reminiscences concerning the progress of the flying boat from World \nWar I through the end of World War II, most specifically as it related to the R&D \nleading to aerodynamic refinement. Documents 5-25 through 5-29 will close this \nsection by providing some insights into what has happened in the field of flying \nboats from 1945 to the present.\nPart 3: Rotary-Wing Aircraft\nThe two types of aircraft studied so far in this chapter—the airship and the \nflying boat—enjoyed their heyday prior to 1945. During the 1920s and 1930s, they \nenjoyed a golden age during which most experts felt that these aircraft would make \nmany fundamental and long-lasting contributions to aviation. Some enthusiasts \neven felt that they would become a predominant form of aircraft and monopolize \ncertain aviation missions and arenas. Commercial, military, and government estab\xad\nlishments dedicated substantial resources to their development; as we have already \nseen, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, for one, focused consider\xad\nable attention on both through regular subcommittees devoted to their advance\xad\nment. As aircraft technologies progressed generally, the form of the airship and the \nflying boat improved as well. Both types contributed to aviation’s projection of \nmilitary and commercial power in the pre–World War II era, and both launched a \nnumber of airline routes, including the first transoceanic ones. So important were \nthese two types of aircraft that it is impossible to understand aviation development \nbefore 1940 without paying attention to the roles fulfilled by these machines.\nAs the airship and flying boat passed into twilight, another form of aircraft \ncame out of the shadows. This was the rotary-wing machine, notably the helicop\xad\nter: a vehicle that could have radically affected the course of World War II combat \nif it had been available. Not that it was a brand new invention after 1945; that was \nhardly the case. Helicopter pioneer Igor Sikorsky believed that “[t]he idea of a vehicle \nthat could lift itself vertically off the ground and hover in the air was probably born \nat the same time that man first dreamed of flying.”8 As we will see in Documents \n5-30 through 5-35, a significant amount of work had been done to advance the \nscience and technology of vertical flight long before World War II. But researchers \nhad not solved enough of the enormous technical problems to turn rotary-wing air\xad\ncraft into practical machinery. This was particularly true for the helicopter, a type \nof heavier-than-air craft in which lift was obtained by means of one or more power-\ndriven rotors and that sought to achieve a magnificent flight capability that no other \n8\t Quoted in J. Gordon Leishman, Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics (Cambridge University \nPress, 2000), p. 1.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n26\nCoronado and Martin PBM Mariner patrol boats used so extensively by the Navy \nin World War II. Most of these mature flying boats included the same innovative \ntechnology, such as radial air-cooled engines, streamlined nacelles, optimum wing-\nmounted engine locations, variable-pitch propellers, wing flaps, cantilever wings, \nadvanced NACA airfoils, and all-metal (or mostly metal) construction. If not for \nthe simultaneous development of reliable large, multi-engine, long-distance land\xad\nplane transports, plus a large number of airports with long, hard-surface runways to \nservice them—both developments related to military requirements and the fight\xad\ning of a global war—the age of the great flying boat might have lasted longer than \nit\xa0did.\nAs it was, that age essentially ended when Pan American Airways, a company \nwhose reputation was first established by sending luxury flying boats on long over-\nwater routes to places like Rio de Janeiro, Hawaii, the Philippines, and China, \nterminated its flying-boat operations in April 1946. The Navy and the United \nStates Coast Guard continued to employ a few flying boats for reconnaissance, \nantisubmarine patrol, and search-and-rescue missions after 1945, and a few com\xad\nmercial operators used them to fly tourists and packages from island to nearby \nisland, for example, in the Caribbean and the South Pacific. But even more so than \nthe airship, the flying boat mostly disappeared shortly after World War II. Various \ntypes of landplanes took over most of the flying boats’ missions, and the ones they \nmissed were picked up by helicopters. A few countries, notably Japan and the Soviet \nFIGURE 5.16. The “modern” flying boats from Boeing and Martin made Pan American Airways’ transoceanic \nroutes possible in the 1930s.

In connection with the meeting, an \ninspection was made of the facilities of the tank and methods of making tests and \nof the models used. Motion pictures of the spray and wake characteristics of several \nmodels of floats and hulls were exhibited and a demonstration was made of the \ntowing of a model through the water.\nA statement of the research under way in the tank during the past year is \ngiven\xa0below.\nSeaplanes.—The definite promise of air transport across the Pacific by means of \nflying boats and the belief that, once the trans-Pacific service is established, trans-\nAtlantic service will be developed very rapidly has led to a general increase in the \ninterest in seaplanes and flying boats. The development of very large flying boats, \nof gross loads of 50 to 150 tons, is discussed with confidence. It also appears that \nprivate owners have become more interested in seaplanes as such, while new and \nlarger amphibians are already under test or are being designed.\nA recent development is the appreciation by pilots of the importance of hold\xad\ning the trim of a seaplane that is taking off to the best angles, i.e., the angles that \ngive the least resistance. The N.A.C.A. trim-angle indicator described in Technical \nNote No. 486 has been successfully used by test pilots and improved take-off per\xad\nformances are reported to result from its use. An improved form of the instrument \nis now being designed.\nAmong the advantages derived from the great length of the N.A.C.A. tank is \nthe ability to obtain several sets of readings in the course of a single run of the tow\xad\ning carriage. In order to use this advantage to the full, it was necessary to devise \nwave suppressors that would very quickly reduce the waves produced by a model to \nmagnitudes that would not affect the next run. The wave suppressors now in use \nare described in Technical Note No. 513. They are so effective that test runs may \nsafely be made in immediate succession and all the data for a general test of a model \ncan easily be obtained in 2 days of operation.\nThe design of a model-cutting machine for use in making both wax and \nwooden models has progressed to the point where detailed plans have been started. \nThis machine is designed to cut water lines, buttock lines, and transverse sections', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n404\nFurthermore, the air propellers must be kept clear of the water, and to provide this \nclearance it has been necessary to make the body that floats the seaplane larger than \nis needed for carrying passengers or cargo. As a result of these conflicting require\xad\nments, seaplane design has been a compromise. Seaplanes have not been as speedy \nas comparable landplanes of equal power and weight, because they had to carry \nextra bulk through the air in the form of large hulls or protruding floats that tended \nto have high drag. Two military planes extensively used during the war were the \nCoronado and the Liberator. Both had four engines of the same power, the same \ntype of propellers, and the same size wing. But the Coronado, a seaplane, was thirty \nmiles per hour slower than the Liberator landplane, because the poorly streamlined \nseaplane body was about twice as big as that of the other.\nAs some compensation for their lower air speeds, seaplanes have a certain \nadvantage in their independence of prepared runways. They can come down and \ntake off wherever there is a sizable stream, and most cities are on or within easy \nreach of a river, lake, or sea. Moreover, three-quarters of the globe’s surface is water, \nso the emergency of a forced landing is hardly ever as dangerous for a waterplane as \nit is for a landplane. The amphibian, equipped with both landing wheels and floats, \nis equally at home on land and water.\nBefore the war, the Clipper flying boats pioneered the transport services to \nHawaii, the Philippines, China, South America, and Europe. During the war the \nNavy used flying boats for both combat and transport. Seaplanes were active in \nrescue work and as patrols in antisubmarine and other ocean operations. It was a \nCatalina flying boat that sighted the German battleship Bismarck in the Atlantic \nand shadowed it until British bombers and warships arrived. It was another flying \nboat, the huge Mars of the Naval Air Transport Service, that took off from Maryland \nwaters in November of 1943 with a gross weight of 148,500 pounds, the heaviest \nload that ever had been lifted by any airplane, and flew 4,250 miles non-stop to \nNatal, Brazil, in twenty-eight hours and twenty-five minutes (about 150\xa0miles per \nhour) to carry six and a half tons of Christmas mail for the armed\xa0services.\nBEGINNINGS OF HYDRODYNAMIC RESEARCH\nThe original research program at Langley made no provision for airplane \nhydrodynamics, and during its first decade the efforts of the staff were concen\xad\ntrated almost entirely on problems of the landplane. Many of the studies in wind \ntunnels and engine laboratories were applicable to seaplanes, and they[,] in com\xad\nmon with landplanes[,] benefited from improvements in wings, propellers, engine \ncowlings, and other developments of the twenties. But it was recognized that the \nairplane on the water has problems that are not shared by the airplane in the air or \non the landing strip, and in 1929 the Committee in Washington decided to enlarge \nthe organization and equipment at Langley to provide for research in hydrodynam\xad\nics.

This discussion has taken an added \nimpetus during the war because of the anticipated surge in long range air com\xad\nmerce at the war’s conclusion. In most cases these discussions have concluded that \nthe flying boat has a definite sphere of use provided the inherent disadvantages in \nperformance can be minimized or eliminated so that the choice depends upon util\xad\nity rather than performance.\nThe factors influencing this situation in current design are: (a) The flying boat \nis inherently a large airplane and parity based on size alone is still dependent upon \ngeneral growth in airplane size, and (b) The contemporary flying boat hull form \nhas progressed but little from that used in 1919 on the NC-4. This penalty has \nnot allowed the flying boat to take full advantage of rapid strides in aerodynamic \ndesign which have been utilized to the fullest extent by the land plane due to its \nrelative freedom from under-carriage problems.\nWhile item (a) will be gradually realized as the land plane under-carriage pres\xad\nents increasingly complex problems, it is necessary that immediate steps be taken \nto investigate the possibilities of improvement through redesign so that parity can \nbe more nearly realized in current design. It is the object of this report to initiate \na sound development problem resulting in marked improvement in hull form and \nhydrodynamic sustention using a currently practical airplane design of 180,000 \npounds gross weight as an example.\nThe ten proposals that follow can be roughly divided into two basic categories: \nSingle hull and twin hull. These proposals are intended to show basic trends and \nnot to reflect a definite design.

Proposal No. 1 illustrates contemporary good design \npractice utilizing four Pratt and Whitney X Wasp Major engines, having a wing \nloading of 50 lbs/sq.ft., a beam loading of CD0\xa0=\xa0.90 for a length-beam ratio of 6.0 \nand a take-off time of 60 seconds.

The flying boat played a significant role in aviation development before 1940. It was one of the two types of aircraft that enjoyed a golden age during the 1920s and 1930s, with most experts believing that they would make fundamental and long-lasting contributions to aviation. The flying boat was considered a predominant form of aircraft and was expected to monopolize certain aviation missions and arenas. Commercial, military, and government establishments dedicated substantial resources to their development.

The flying boat contributed to aviation's projection of military and commercial power in the pre-World War II era. It launched a number of airline routes, including the first transoceanic ones. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics focused considerable attention on the flying boat through regular subcommittees devoted to its advancement. It is impossible to understand aviation development before 1940 without paying attention to the roles fulfilled by the flying boat."
Question: What is an Autogiro and what are some of its unique features compared to airplanes?,"An Autogiro is a type of aircraft that is neither a helicopter nor an airplane, but rather a combination of the two. It uses a rotating wing, or rotor, to provide lift and a propeller for forward motion. The rotor is similar to that of a helicopter, but the Autogiro does not have the ability to hover in place like a helicopter. Instead, it can only descend vertically or hover briefly before taking off. 

One of the unique features of the Autogiro is its ability to land in a small space, similar to a helicopter. However, unlike a helicopter, the Autogiro cannot maintain a velocity of zero while on the ground, which can make takeoff and landing more challenging. 

Another unique feature of the Autogiro is that it can operate at lower speeds than an airplane, as it does not require the same amount of power to maintain lift. This makes it a more efficient aircraft for certain types of operations, such as crop dusting or surveying. 

Overall, the Autogiro is a transition aircraft between the conventional airplane and the helicopter, and it has been used for various purposes throughout history.","['579\nDocument 5-37\ntraffic.

Cuatro Vientos \nAirdrome, February 1, 1923.\n(Signed) Emilio Herrera,\nChief of the Laboratory,\nSporting Commissioner of the F.A.I.\nThe “Autogiro” has ceased \nto be a scientific curiosity and \nhas become something which \ncan be developed commer\xad\ncially. The tests of last January \nhave proved that it can fly, that \nit is more stable than an air\xad\nplane and that it can alight ver\xad\ntically and without speed. We \nhave now to determine its exact \nefficiency, which should be at \nleast 90% that of an airplane.\nIn the workshops of the \nIndustrial \nSchool, \nwhere \nthe most delicate parts of \n“Autogiros” Nos. 2, 3 and 4 \nwere constructed, “Autogiro” No. 5 is at present being built, under the supervision \nof La Cierva. This aircraft will have improvements which will increase its efficiency \nand carrying capacity. It will be able to carry a passenger and to make long flights, \nwhich it would not have been prudent to attempt with the previous aircraft, built \nsolely for experimental purposes. “Autogiro” No. 4 was the last of the experimental \nseries, and No. 5 will be the first of the commercial series. Those who have followed \nits progress will not go to the airport simply to see it fly and descend vertically \nwithout an appreciable forward speed, but to see it compete with its elder brother, \nthe airplane.\nThe “Autogiro” is not a helicopter nor an aeronautic freak pretending to solve a \ndifficult problem of mechanics, but is a perfected airplane, although not designed \nwith the sporting purpose of increasing speed nor with the commercial object of \nenlarging the radius of action, but with the humanitarian purpose of reducing to a \nminimum the number of accidents and the number of human lives sacrificed in the \nfight for the conquest of the air.\nNearly all aviation accidents are due to loss of speed, which diminishes the lift\xad\ning force and leaves the airplane subject to the force of gravity. The “Autogiro” is \nnot affected by loss of speed. An engine failure, a sudden “nose up” or a very sharp \nturn may interrupt its horizontal flight and make it descend toward the ground, Phot of autogiro Number 4 flying at Cuatro Vientos, January 31, 1923.\nFIG. 8.\u2002 Autogiro No. 4.

The other two terms \nbeing equal, it follows that the required horse-power will increase or decrease with \nthe weight more quickly in a given autogiro than in the equivalent aeroplane of the \nsame span, and the same applies to the density and, consequently, with the altitude, \nassuming the same speed in both.\nThis fundamental difference with the aeroplane would be against the efficiency \nof the autogiro but for two reasons, one aerodynamical and the other construc\xad\ntional. The first is that the above mentioned third term of the power equation is, \nin the autogiro, independent of the surface (or rather, almost independent) and the \nsecond is that an increase in diameter of an autogiro represents much less increase \nin weight than the same increase in the span of an aeroplane. It sounds paradoxi\xad\ncal, but if the blades of an autogiro are substituted for others of exactly the same \nconstruction and the same chord, but of greater length, the stresses, both on the \nhinges and on the blades themselves[,] will be about the same if the blades are suf\xad\nficiently flexible in the plane of flapping, so that the secondary bending moments \nare considerably relieved by the deformation of the blade in elevation. Incidentally, \nthat flexibility also considerably relieves any sudden overload making the autogiro \nthe stronger the flimsier it looks.\nAll this makes comparison between aeroplane and autogiro unfair assuming \nthe same span for both, since span, that precious parameter, costs much less in the \nsecond, and this consideration corrects for the autogiro in practice the greater sen\xad\nsitiveness to the weight and altitude. Autogiros with correct proportions can carry \nthe same normal load as equivalent aeroplanes and have about the same ceiling.\nA definite advantage of the autogiro with regard to the aeroplane is its extraor\xad\ndinary aerodynamical flexibility and adaptability. In an aeroplane the load per \nsquare foot of wing area defines its landing qualities, and if the power is increased, \nin order to obtain the full benefit, an increase in wing loading must follow with a \ncorresponding increase in the landing speed. Roughly speaking, the landing speed \nof an aeroplane is proportional to its top speed. In an autogiro the landing qualities \ndepend almost exclusively on the load per square foot of disc area, while in order to \nobtain the best possible efficiency at top speed it is only necessary to keep the ratio \ntip speed to top speed equal to about one point five, which ratio depends only on \nactual blade area, assuming the pitch constant. This means that, within wide lim\xad\nits, autogiros can be designed to have very different top speeds, but exactly the same \nqualities in landing and descent. Of course, a limit must come when the blades, \neven reduced to three in number (two blades only have been tested in flight and \nfound impossibly rough) will become too narrow and thin, but beyond that limit a \ndecrease in pitch angle can still be used to increase the rotational speed with only a \nslight decrease in efficiency at slower speeds, not very important in machines with \na considerable excess of power. It will probably be possible to go beyond the new \nlimit by using for the rotary blades aerofoil sections with a less abrupt stalling than \nthe Gottingen 429, stalling that when produced on a considerable portion of the', '601\nDocument 5-40\nthis fact which confirms the \nview we had expressed at the \nbeginning, namely, that the \nautogiro is destined to play \nonly the part of a transition \naircraft from the conven\xad\ntional airplane to the heli\xad\ncopter. The autogiro fails \nto solve half the problem \nsince, while it makes possi\xad\nble landing in a small space, \nit does not permit a velocity \nzero while the take-off and \nall other performances con\xad\nnected with the climb char\xad\nacteristics are less favorable. \nAs regards weight, there is \nno essential disadvantage. \nOn the contrary, particu\xad\nlarly in large designs, the \nreduction in weight caused \nby the use of lifting surfaces free from forces due to pressure and extended by the \ncentrifugal forces should more than offset the heavy propeller hub and starting \ngear. This is a very valuable property of all rotating-wing aircraft and hence also of \nB) HELICOPTERS\nwhich we shall now consider. In regard to the question of weight we must still \nmake the greatest sacrifice, probably the only one in the future. The gears must \ntransmit to the propellers with sufficient reliability the full maximum power of the \nengines, a circumstance which in the case of small aircraft puts the helicopter at a \ndisadvantage as compared with the conventional airplane. Breguet has computed \na helicopter of 16 tons gross weight and claims to have found a saving in weight as \ncompared with the corresponding airplane. Although this appears too optimistic, \nit may be stated roughly that with increasing size of aircraft the proportion of the \nweight taken up by the drive gear will be reduced sharply as compared with the \nweights very small due to absence of pressure forces of the lifting parts.\nAs regards the maximum velocity the question arises at the very beginning \nwhether it is advantageous to have a given rotating-wing aircraft operate as an auto\xad\ngiro or as a helicopter, that is, without propulsive propeller. For it is conceivable that \nour initial requirements would be met if the helicopter in high-speed flight would \noperate as an autogiro or in some intermediate state. This important question we Graph with forward speed on the x-axis and power required on the y-axis. It gives a comparison of required and available power of conventional airplane and autogiro.The autogiro needs more power at lower speeds but can function at lower speeds.\nFIGURE 4.

La Cierva’s Autogiro \nis a most curious machine, neither a heli\xad\ncopter nor an airplane, but with a wind\xad\nmill operating in a lateral wind providing \nsustentation. The principles of operation of \nthe windmill have already been described. \nThe machine is illustrated in Fig. 15. The \nAutogiro weighs about 880 lb. empty, and \n1100 lb. loaded. With an 80 HP. engine \nthe maximum speed is 55\xa0 M.P.H.; the \nminimum speed is 33 M.P.H. The rota\xad\ntional speed of the lifting vane is about 140 \nR.P.M. The diameter of the vane is 26.2 ft. The vertical component of velocity on \na steep glide is said to be surprisingly low. The Autogiro certainly deserves careful \nconsideration.\nCONCLUSION\nWhile predictions in matters regarding the helicopter are rash, it is safe to say \nthat three lines of development are definitely open: (1) The combined helicopter-\nairplane; (2) the multiple-engined helicopter; and (3) the helicopter with gliding \nability by virtue of windmill action of the reversed-pitch airscrews.\nThe combined helicopter-airplane, of which the Berliner is such an excellent \nexample, is a thoroughly practical proposition. Since descent with engine dead is \ntaken care of by airplane wings, comparatively small airscrews need be provided. \nThis means general compactness of design, high values of V/nD, and ultimately \ngood efficiency in forward flight. Also, since descent is taken care of by gliding \nplanes, the main lifting screws do not need variable pitch, and the mechanism is \nreduced to a simple speed-reduction and power-transmission problem. Mechanical \nsimplicity is thus assured. This type of craft is not so likely to be very efficient in \nvertical climb, since it will have a very large wing surface resisting upward motion. \nThe climb of a helicopter-airplane will be more analogous to that of an ordinary \nairplane. On the glide, it is not to be hoped for that this type will be as efficient as \nan ordinary airplane. In hovering, more power is likely to be required than in the \nhelicopter proper. The combined helicopter-airplane, while the most readily real\xad\nized, may be said to depart from the ideal conception of a helicopter, which can \nrise vertically with ease and descend with engine cut out, either vertically or on a \nvery steep path. It may be a very valuable compromise between the airplane and the \nhelicopter proper.\nThe multiple-engined helicopter has never been seriously attacked. Damblanc’s \n“Alerion,” with its two engines, each capable of driving the two sustaining airscrews, \nis the nearest approach to such a type. A machine is conceivable with, say, six small Photo of La Cierva's Autogiro with one 4-bladed rotor at the top, a propeller in the front, and what appear to be wings at the back.\nFIG. 15.

An Autogiro is a type of aircraft that has unique features compared to airplanes. It is a rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift. Unlike airplanes, an Autogiro does not have a fixed wing and does not require an engine to generate lift.

One of the most characteristic features of Autogiro performance is that it will not stall in the airplane sense of the word and cannot spin. This is because the rotor blades continue to turn even when the Autogiro is not moving forward, providing lift and stability.

Another unique feature of Autogiros is that they can take off and land vertically, making them useful for operations in confined spaces. They can also hover in place, which is not possible with airplanes.

The American organization engaged in Autogiro development was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1931 for the greatest achievement in aviation, demonstrating the value of Autogiros in actual use during the preceding year."

A study of the effect on certain rotor characteristics \nof a periodic variation in blade-pitch angle has been made, and the results have \nbeen published in Technical Report No. 591. The predicted value of the flapping \nmotion of the rotor blade was radically altered when the periodic pitch variation \nwas inserted in the rotor analysis, and an appreciable influence of the periodic pitch \non the rotor thrust coefficient was indicated.

The preliminary step in this investiga\xad\ntion was to supplement theoretical calculations of the operating blade elements in \nvarious parts of the disk with photographic observations of the behavior of silk tufts \nmounted on the blades of a YG-1B autogiro.

One phase \nof this, which has been completed, is the analysis of the rotor-blade oscillation in \nthe plane of the rotor disk.

The results \nof this investigation served two purposes: (1)\xa0The measured loads on the fixed wing \nhave aided in the formulation of design rules for the fixed wings of this type of \naircraft, and (2)\xa0the load on the rotor correlated with the measured blade motion \nhas provided data needed for a theoretical study of rotor characteristics, the results \nof which are now being prepared for publication. A brief investigation of the vibra\xad\ntions occurring in a 3-blade autogiro has also been completed, and flight tests are \nin progress for the purpose of determining the effect of the incidence of the fixed \nwings on the rotor characteristics and on performance in general.\nThe second type of rotating wing being investigated, the gyroplane, is similar \nin general principle to the autogiro, but is fundamentally different in regard to its \nrotor operation, in that opposite blades of the rotor are rigidly connected and lift \non these blades is equalized by oscillation about an axis parallel to the blade span. \nA theoretical analysis of this type of machine has been completed and is now in \npreparation for publication.\nThe third type being investigated, the cyclogiro, derives its lift and thrust from \na power-driven rotor consisting of several blades rotating about an axis parallel to \nthe lateral axis of the aircraft. A theoretical analysis of the cyclogiro has been com\xad\npleted and a simplified aerodynamic theory of the machine has been prepared and \npublished (Technical Note No. 467).

More than that, he pronounced, based on his review of all the extant tech\xad\nnical literature, that the NACA’s critical evaluation of rotary-wing performance \nhelped lead to the demise of the autogiro and to a renaissance of interest in heli\xad\ncopters. In the view of NACA researchers by 1940, the free or “automatic” rotation \nof blades simply did not suffice and probably never would.

1. Research on rotor control systems: In 1938, a theoretical study of rotating-wing aircraft control systems was conducted, focusing on the effect of periodically feathering the blades of an articulated rotor. The aerodynamic identity of the Hafner and Cierva control systems was mathematically demonstrated. A study of the torque equilibrium in the autogiro rotor was completed and published in Technical Report No. 623, simplifying and improving the previous method of calculating the inflow velocity required to maintain autorotation. The study did not yet extend to rigid rotors, but it was hoped that it could be done in the near future.

2. Investigation of lift-drag ratio improvement: In 1939, the possibility of improving the lift-drag ratio of rotors in forward flight, specifically retarding or preventing the stalling of the inboard elements of the retreating blades, was being investigated. The preliminary step involved supplementing theoretical calculations with photographic observations of silk tufts mounted on the blades of a YG-1B autogiro. The tuft observations indicated that the stalled portion of the rotor disk was larger than expected. A technical note presenting the results of the initial observations was being prepared, and additional observations on blades of various airfoil sections and plan forms were in progress.

3. Analysis of control vibration in direct-control autogiros: An attempt was made to isolate the factors responsible for the severe vibration present in the control systems of present-day direct-control autogiros. The varying loads in the control system of a YG-1B autogiro were recorded in flight at various air speeds. Analysis of the records indicated that mass unbalance or improper matching of the blades was not responsible for the control vibration in this machine. Some modification of hub and blades was deemed desirable. Similar tests on the same machine equipped with blades of improved design were in progress. Data on the blade motion and the control characteristics of nonarticulated feathering rotors were obtained from flight tests of the Wilford XOZ-1 sea gyroplane and were being evaluated."
"Question: Why did Kennedy propose making Apollo a joint mission with the Soviet Union, and what were the Soviet's responses to this proposal?","In April 1961, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was tasked by President Kennedy to assess potential policy changes that could help change the subject from administration failures. Johnson polled NASA leaders and scientific and technical gurus about a new space initiative. Among others, Wernher von Braun, Director of NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, recommended committing the nation to a lunar landing, stating that ""we have a sporting chance of sending a 3-man crew around the moon ahead of the Soviets"" and ""an excellent chance of beating the Soviets to the first landing of a crew on the moon (including return capability, of course)."" After gaining these technical opinions, Johnson lined up political support for a Moon landing. President Kennedy unveiled the commitment to undertake Project Apollo on May 25, 1961, in a speech on ""Urgent National Needs,"" stating that ""no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish."" 

In his inaugural address in January 1961, President Kennedy spoke directly to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and asked him to cooperate in exploring ""the stars."" In his State of the Union address 10 days later, he asked the Soviet Union ""to join us in developing a weather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program, and in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the Universe."" Within two weeks of giving his May 25 speech, Kennedy met Khrushchev at the Vienna summit and proposed making Apollo a joint mission with the Soviets. The Soviet leader reportedly first said no, then replied ""why not?"" and then changed his mind again, saying that disarmament was a prerequisite for U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space. Kennedy confided to James Webb that he felt vulnerable to the Republican charges concerning the Moon program and thought refashioning it into a cooperative effort could defuse the situation. On September 20, 1963, Kennedy made a well-known speech before the United Nations, in which he again proposed a joint human mission to the Moon.

He harbored the possibility of making the program a joint effort with \nthe Soviet Union. In his inaugural address in January 1961, Kennedy spoke \ndirectly to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and asked him to cooperate in \nexploring “the stars.” In his State of the Union address 10 days later, he asked \nthe Soviet Union “to join us in developing a weather prediction program, in a \nnew communications satellite program, and in preparation for probing the dis\xad\ntant planets of Mars and Venus, probes which may someday unlock the deepest \nsecrets of the Universe.”8\nWithin two weeks of giving his 25 May speech, Kennedy met Khrushchev \nat the Vienna summit and proposed making Apollo a joint mission with the \nSoviets. The Soviet leader reportedly first said no, then replied “why not?” and \nthen changed his mind again, saying that disarmament was a prerequisite for \nU.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space. Kennedy confided to James Webb that he\nfelt vulnerable to the Republican charges concerning the Moon program and\nthought refashioning it into a cooperative effort could defuse the situation.\nOn 20 September 1963, Kennedy made a well-known speech before the \nUnited Nations, in which he again proposed a joint human mission to the \nMoon. He closed by urging, “Let us do the big things together.”9 In public, \nthe Soviet Union was noncommittal. The Soviet official newspaper, Pravda, \nfor example, dismissed the 1963 proposal as premature. Some have suggested \nthat Khrushchev viewed the American offer as a ploy to open up Soviet society \nand compromise Soviet technology. Although these efforts did not produce any \nspace agreements, the fact that Kennedy pursued various forms of space coop\xad\neration until his assassination in 1963 portended what might have resulted had \nhe remained in office for a full two terms.\nHarnessing Resources\nWhen NASA learned of the President’s decision to move forward with the \nMoon landing, its leaders reacted with the mixed emotions of excitement and \nanguish. They could finally realize many of their dreams for an aggressive space \nprogram. At the same time, it placed an enormous burden on the Agency.

It was the first international human space\xad\nflight, taking place at the height of the rapprochement between the United \nStates and the Soviet Union in 1975. While it specifically tested the technolo\xad\ngies of rendezvous and docking systems for American and Soviet spacecraft to \noperate together, its fundamental purpose was to walk back from the abyss of \nnuclear annihilation and find a path for engagement between the superpower \nrivals of the Cold War. If it worked out, perhaps the United States and the \nU.S.S.R. could undertake international space rescue as well as future joint \npiloted flights. The Americans used Apollo spacecraft nearly identical to the \nones that orbited the Moon and later carried astronauts to Skylab, while the \nSoyuz craft was the primary Soviet vehicle used for cosmonaut flight since \nits introduction in 1967. A universal docking module was designed and con\xad\nstructed by NASA to serve as an airlock and transfer corridor between the \ntwo craft.\nThe actual flight took place between 15 and 24 July 1975, when astronauts \nThomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton took off from \nKennedy Space Center to meet the already orbiting Soyuz spacecraft. Some \n45 hours later, the two craft rendezvoused and docked, and then Apollo and \nSoyuz crews conducted a variety of experiments over a two-day period. After \nseparation, the Apollo vehicle remained in space an additional six days while \nSoyuz returned to Earth approximately 43 hours after separation.

Two days after the Gagarin flight, \nKennedy discussed the possibility of a lunar landing program with Jim Webb, but \nKennedy delayed deciding when NASA’s conservative estimates projected a cost \nof more than $30 billion, more than $250 billion in 2020\xa0dollars. \nThat changed a week later when the embarrassing U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs \ninvasion failed in Cuba. At that point, Kennedy called Vice President Lyndon \nB. Johnson to assess what policy changes might help change the subject from \nKennedy administration failures. As he wrote in a memorandum to Johnson on \n20 April 1961, do “we have a chance of beating the Soviets by…a trip around \nthe moon, or by a rocket to land on the moon, or by a rocket to go to the \nmoon and back with a man.

Among oth\xad\ners, Wernher von Braun, Director of NASA’s George C.

What is the difference between PNdB and EPNdB in the context of aircraft noise measurement?,"In the context of aircraft noise measurement, PNdB (perceived noise in decibels) was the subjective ""measure of annoyance"" that reflected the overall intensity of a sound, its frequency content, and how people responded to it. However, the special circumstances of the aircraft noise problem necessitated a better and more relevant measure and resulted in the defining of a more appropriate and relevant noise measurement unit, the effective perceived noise in decibels, or EPNdB. The EPNdB accounted for two additional factors beyond PNdB: first, it gave more importance to tones in the noise spectrum, and second, it accounted for the duration, or rise and fall, of a sound. In essence, EPNdB provided the single number that expressed the measure of the total annoyance a person experienced as an airplane flew over.","['The Power for Flight\n74\nthat noise was “the curse of modern times and a major environmental prob\xad\nlem.”3 The scientific measure of sound intensity, most commonly heard as \nnoise, is the decibel. The threshold of pain starts at 120 dB, while 140 produces \npermanent damage. While the decibel is a specific term for the level of sound \noutput, acoustics researchers use “PNdB,” or “perceived noise in decibels,” \nto measure the sound affecting people in the vicinity of an aircraft. In early \naircraft noise research, PNdB was the subjective “measure of annoyance” that \nreflected the overall intensity of a sound, its frequency content, and how people \nresponded to it. But the special circumstances of the aircraft noise problem \ncharacterized by whining jet aircraft passing overhead necessitated a better \nand more relevant measure and resulted in the defining of a more appropriate \nand relevant noise measurement unit, the effective perceived noise in decibels, \nor EPNdB. The EPNdB accounted for two additional factors beyond PNdB: \nfirst, it gave more importance to tones in the noise spectrum, and second, it \naccounted for the duration, or rise and fall, of a sound. In essence, EPNdB \nprovided the single number that expressed the measure of the total annoyance \na person experienced as an airplane flew over.\nA four-engine commercial airliner of the 1960s or early 1970s generated \n95 to 120 EPNdB at takeoff, which was a potential cause of hearing damage \nto the general populace and detrimental overall to the quality of life around \nairports. In a world full of “chattering jackhammers, whining motorcycles, and \nroaring jetliners,” Representative William F. Ryan (D-NY) asserted, “the right \nto a quiet, peaceful environment is as basic as the right to clean air and water \nand pure food.” The EPA led the effort to limit noise emissions as it had done \nfor air and water, but Congress planned comprehensive legislation addressing \nnoise in the 1970s. Congress specifically authorized the FAA to muffle “the \nloudest source of urban noise”: low-flying jet aircraft.4\nEarly in the Jet Age, communities and environmental activists recognized \nthat noise and emissions were significant byproducts of jet travel. While other \nparts of an aircraft generated noise in flight, the jet engine was the greatest \nsource. In terms of their effect on people on the ground, jet aircraft are loudest \nduring takeoffs and landings. At takeoffs, the exhaust gases from the engine \nmix with the cooler air outside the engine to create a roar. As an airliner \napproaches a runway to land, the pilots reduce power to slow down, which \ncreates a hissing noise. NASA’s overall gas turbine research and development \nprogram focused on increasing the fuel efficiency of high-bypass-ratio engines. \nAlthough fuel efficiency was the goal, any innovations in that area had to \navoid increased engine noise, which was a factor to which the public reacted \nnegatively beginning in the 1960s. NASA began investigating the relationship \nbetween turbofan-cycle characteristics and engine noise levels, size, and perfor\xad\nmance in 1966. Agency researchers learned that the fan generated the highest', 'The Power for Flight\n80\nCongressional lawmakers, the FAA, the airline industry, and NASA differed \nin their approaches on how best to go about reducing aircraft noise. The options \nincluded installing new architectural structures at the airports, modifying exist\xad\ning aircraft, or working toward the design and manufacture of new aircraft and \nengines that cost upward of $30 million each.22\nTo indicate the effect of sound on the quality of life, the FAA’s noise regula\xad\ntions specifically referenced EPNdB and set maximum limits at specific ground \nlocations near an airport. The installation of sound-measuring equipment \ndetermined EPNdB at takeoff, along a line parallel to the runway at takeoff \ncalled the sideline (3.25 nautical miles for three-engine aircraft, 3.5\xa0nauti\xad\ncal miles for four), and at landing. Landing noise was the worst because it \nintensified as the aircraft flew closer to the ground and required measuring \nequipment 1 nautical mile (1.15 miles) from the touchdown path and 370 feet \nbelow the airplane. For new and larger airliners such as the 747, the limit was \n108\xa0EPNdB. For new aircraft equivalent to the 707, the EPNdB restrictions \nwere 104 at takeoff and 106 for the sideline and landing. Actual 707 and DC-8 \naircraft exceeded those levels.23\nInstituting Noise Abatement: The Search for an Operational Fix\nNoise was a problem at many levels. Community disdain for noisy airports pre\xad\nvented the construction of several more specialized and quieter airports because \nof the challenges facing developers to even acquire land at all. Centralized, \nall-purpose airports promoted economic efficiency, but they also increased \nnoise, congestion, and pollution. The expansion of short-haul services com\xad\npounded the problem because the aircraft available were noisy and worked best \nfrom airports close to city centers, which were unavailable due to community \nresistance. NASA and DOT released their joint report, Civil Aviation Research \nand Development (CARD) Policy Study, in May 1971. The 2-year study was an \neffort to establish national goals and policies for aeronautics and aviation. It \nfocused on several critical areas, including noise abatement, airway and airport \ncongestion, and the lack of adequate low- and high-density short-haul aircraft \nsystems.24 The central message was that the aviation industry, with appropriate \nGovernment assistance, had to do a better job of tailoring technology to solu\xad\ntions that met those problems, which were complicated and interrelated. DOT \nand NASA recognized that paying attention to sociological, economic, and \nengineering factors was the key to the solution. The Washington Post believed \nthat prescription made sense for both the industry and the public.25\nThe results of the CARD study lead to a number of conclusions regarding \nNASA research and development priorities. Aircraft noise abatement deserved \nthe highest priority because of widespread concern for the environment and \nbecause that program’s success affected the solutions to other problems.', 'The Power for Flight\n234\nCIA\t\nCentral Intelligence Agency\nCLEEN\t\nContinuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise\nCO\t\ncarbon monoxide\nCO2\t\ncarbon dioxide\nCPC\t\nCritical Propulsion Components\nDARPA\t\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency\ndB\t\ndecibels\nDEEC\t\nDigital Electronic Engine Control\nDEFCS\t\nDigital Electronic Flight Control System\nDLR\t\nGerman Aerospace Center\nDOD\t\nDepartment of Defense\nDOE \t\nDepartment of Energy\nDOT\t\nDepartment of Transportation\nE3, or EEE\t\nEnergy Efficient Engine\nECCP\t\nExperimental Clean Combustor Program\nECI\t\nEngine Component Improvement\nEPA\t\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\nEPM\t\nEnabling Propulsion Materials\nEPNdB\t\neffective perceived noise in decibels\nERA\t\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation\nERAST\t\nEnvironmental Research and Aircraft Sensor Technology\nERB\t\nEngine Research Building\nETAF\t\nEnergy Trends and Alternate Fuels\nETOPS\t\nExtended Range Twin Operations\nEVNRC\t\nEngine Validation of Noise Reduction Concepts\nFAA\t\nFederal Aviation Administration\nFADEC\t\nfull-authority digital electronic control\nFAR\t\nFederal Aviation Regulations\nFCC\t\nflight control computer\nFLADE\t\nfan-on-blade\nFPS\t\nFlight Propulsion System\nFSER\t\nFull-Scale Engine Research\nGAP\t\nGeneral Aviation Propulsion\nGE\t\nGeneral Electric\nHALE\t\nHigh-Altitude Long-Endurance\nHARV\t\nHigh Alpha Research Vehicle\nHATP\t\nHigh-Angle-of-Attack Technology Program\nHIDEC\t\nHighly Integrated Digital Electronic Control\nHISTEC\t\nHigh Stability Engine Control\nHITEMP\t\nAdvanced High Temperature Engine Materials Technology\xa0\n \nProgram', 'The Shift Toward Commercial Aviation, 1966–1975\n93\nthe conventional under-wing pod installation found on virtually all multi-\nengine jet aircraft. NASA’s design featured an unorthodox mounting on top \nof the wing with a distinctive half-moon nozzle, which protected people on \nthe ground below from noise.76\nLewis and GE evaluated both QCSEEs, and the results in terms of noise, \nemissions, and fuel consumption were dramatic. They were 8 to 12 EPNdB \nquieter than the quietest engine then in use on the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 \nand Boeing 747 wide-body airliners, the GE CF6. That meant they were \n16\xa0EPNdB below FAA standards and 9 EPNdB below the stricter standards to \nbe implemented in the 1980s. QCSEE technology offered a way to reduce that \nnoise “footprint”—the area on the ground, directly below the aircraft, that was \nsubjected to the takeoff and landing noise of the airliner—to approximately \n1 square mile, which was 40 times smaller than the footprint of the Boeing \n707. The researchers achieved the reduction in noise by slowing the velocity of \nthe engine exhaust by increasing the bypass ratio and by other design features \nincluding the use of acoustically absorbent materials.77\nThe QCSEEs provided cleaner emissions and lower fuel consumption. The \ntechnology reduced two of the most problematic air contaminants from jet \nengines, CO and \nTHC, by approximately 80 percent and 97 percent respectively. \nThe new design principles incorporated by GE into the engine combustion \nsystem enabled the technology to meet increasingly stringent EPA standards. \nThe QCSEE engines offered fuel savings of 10 percent. Glenn researchers and \nGE engineers achieved those savings by substituting lightweight, nonmetallic \ncomposite materials of equal or greater strength for much heavier metal com\xad\nponents found in the engine cowling, frame, and fan blades.78\nNASA asserted that engine manufacturers could incorporate the tech\xad\nnology into their higher-thrust engines—those with a thrust in excess of \n40,000\xa0 pounds—that powered the largest commercial airliners.79 It was \napplied to the experimental QSRA developed jointly by NASA and Boeing \nthat utilized the over-the-wing upper-surface blowing technology combined \nwith four Avco-Lycoming YF-102 high-bypass turbofans during its test flight \nprogram from 1978 to 1980, but it did not achieve commercial application.80 \nNevertheless, the QCSEE program anticipated many of the technical features \npursued in the design of turbofan engines in the early 21st century. Both GE \nand Pratt & Whitney incorporated high-bypass-ratio engines in the range of \n10:1 to 12:1, low-pressure-ratio variable-pitch fans, variable-area fan nozzles, \nadvanced acoustic liners, digital electronic controls, clean combustors, reduc\xad\ntion gearing, and composite components into their new products.81', 'Transiting to a New Century, 1990–2008\n191\nteam and Honeywell revealed that the latter generated the best suppression \nlevels. The work demonstrated that a forward-swept fan combined with swept \nand leaned stators reduced inlet and aft-fan noise levels at both the sideline \nand cutback certification points by 2.5 EPNdB.85\nEvaluation of the acoustic liners, HQ tubes, and other noise-reduction solu\xad\ntions was made possible through NASA’s Engine Validation of Noise Reduction \nConcepts (EVNRC) program. Beginning in August 1997, the EVNRC pro\xad\nvided the necessary funding for Honeywell, Pratt & Whitney, Boeing, and \nother contractors to validate noise-reduction concepts and technologies that \nevolved during the AST through engine testing.86 The contracts supported \nwork at industrial research and development facilities through the 2000s.\nNASA also saw the need for the acoustic and aerodynamic integration \nof turbofan engines with the high-lift flap-and-slot systems found on com\xad\nmercial airliners. Researchers aimed to reduce airframe noise by 4 dB at both \ntakeoff/climb and approach/landing below 1992 levels while maintaining per\xad\nformance. The solution was the introduction of new subcomponent airframe \nnoise-prediction codes that allowed for the proper evaluation of interrelation\xad\nship between the disparate structures.87\nThe remaining two research elements centered on improving the overall \nnoise environment for passengers inside the airliner and people on the ground. \nThe research to reduce cabin interior noise by 6 dB relative to 1992 technol\xad\nogy integrated studies in source identification (a combination of engine noise \nand vibration with the aerodynamic boundary layer and the turbofan jet flow) \nwith interior sound prediction and new noise-control concepts. Researchers \nalso endeavored to create technology that reduced the impact of noise on com\xad\nmunities surrounding an airport. They concentrated on achieving a 3-EPNdB \nreduction through the application of new aircraft technologies and operational \nprocedures, enhanced noise impact modeling and prediction, and a better \nunderstanding of the relationship between human response and aircraft noise.88\nThe majority of the aircraft and engine noise-reduction technologies created \nfor the AST program reached the desired TRL of 5 by the program’s end. That \naccomplishment reflected efficient coordination between the Government, \nindustry, and academia. The researchers evaluating the program acknowledged \nthat the AST partnership prepared for “an orderly and effective transition” from \nresearch and development to operational use as NASA and industry carried \nthe technology forward into the 21st century.89\nToward Active Noise Control\nActive noise control was a new approach to reducing noise generated at the fan \ninlet. It was attractive as an enhancement option, or a complete alternative over\xad\nall, to acoustic lining and HQ tubes due to the shorter inlet lengths found on']","
PNdB is a subjective measure of annoyance that reflects the overall intensity of a sound, its frequency content, and how people respond to it. It was used in early aircraft noise research.
EPNdB, on the other hand, is a more appropriate and relevant noise measurement unit for aircraft noise. It accounts for two additional factors beyond PNdB: first, it gives more importance to tones in the noise spectrum, and second, it accounts for the duration, or rise and fall, of a sound. EPNdB provides the single number that expresses the measure of the total annoyance a person experiences as an airplane flies over."
What were the concerns with the sidestick controller and how were they addressed?,"The concerns with the sidestick controller in the XV-15 TRRA were primarily related to its ability to provide the same level of control as the conventional center stick and its performance during degraded flight control system conditions. To address these concerns, a piloted simulation evaluation and a full flight investigation were conducted. The initial control law parameters were established using a refined simulation math model based on the one originally developed in the early stages of the XV-15 project. During the flight program, a total of 13 flights were flown with eight pilots from six agencies. The pilots reported that the sidestick was a viable controller and that the aircraft was safe to fly with a degraded control system. However, the original context of the XV-15's instability with angle of attack also presented a challenge for the pilot. This instability resulted from the flapping of the rotor, where the advancing blades were subjected to a greater upward accelerating force than the retreating blades due to the angle-of-attack change in forward flight. This flapping motion tilted the disk in the direction of the tip-speed squared, causing the helicopter to be unstable with angle of attack.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n812\nand combined above the fuselage centerline, turning vertically upwards to form \na “fountain flow” above and along the aircraft’s longitudinal plane of symmetry \n(figure 58) [not reproduced].\nThese observations confirmed the inboard flow observed from the tuft study \nmentioned earlier. Furthermore, the large air mass involved in the over-fuselage \nfountain flow created a large downward force which accounted for the higher than \nexpected download in the hover mode of flight. As explained later, this fountain \nflow was also found to contribute to the nonuniform distribution of noise around \nthe hovering tilt rotor aircraft.\nSIDESTICK CONTROLLER\nAmong the many decisions made early in the development of the TRRA was \nthe cockpit control configuration. Simulation and flight evaluations by Bell and \nGovernment pilots resulted in the selection of a helicopter-type power lever for rotor \ncontrol and a conventional center stick and rudder pedals for longitudinal, direc\xad\ntional, and pitch control inputs. The tall center stick, however, with its mass-center \nseveral inches above its pivot point, introduced undesirable dynamic effects (called \n“bobweight” motions) during maneuvers. This issue, coupled with the possible inter\xad\nference of the center stick with crew station structure (instrument panel), problems \nwith cockpit ingress or egress, and the general interest in conserving limited cockpit \n“real estate,” led researchers to investigate the use of a sidestick controller as the prin\xad\ncipal flight control for the developing military JVX tilt rotor aircraft (later called the \nV-22 Osprey). The principal concerns with this type [of] controller were whether it \nwould be able to provide the same level of control as the conventional center stick, \nand whether it could perform adequately during “degraded” flight control system \nconditions (such as a malfunctioning or battle-damaged control system).\nTo answer these questions, it was decided to perform a piloted simulation eval\xad\nuation and a full flight investigation of a 3-axis sidestick controller on an XV-15 \nTRRA for both normal and “degraded” flight control system conditions. Gary \nChurchill, senior controls engineer with the TRRA Project Office, developed the \ncontrol laws and was the primary investigator.\nThe XV-15 TRRA was ideal for the installation of the sidestick controller \nbecause it had bulging side windows (designed into the aircraft for better visibility) \nand an uncluttered side console which provided room for a functional installation, \nincluding an adjustable arm rest. A control and status panel for the sidestick con\xad\ntroller was added to the instrument panel.\nInitial sidestick control system gains and sensitivities were established using \nthe Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) and a refined simulation math model \nbased on the one originally developed in the early stages of the XV-15 project. These \ncontrol law parameters were adjusted during XV-15 installation/hangar checks, and \nthe resulting configuration was taken into the flight program.', '813\nDocuments 5-49 (a–d)\nIn July 1985, an intensive flight evaluation of a three-axis sidestick controller \nwas performed in XV-15 N703NA. During a nine day period, a total of 13 flights \nwere flown with eight pilots from six agencies (the NASA, Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Bell Helicopter Textron, and Boeing Helicopters). Control characteristics \nof the center stick and the sidestick controller were compared. Each pilot received \na familiarization flight in the left seat using a conventional center stick control \nand flew an evaluation flight in the right seat which was equipped with a sidestick \ncontroller. Without exception, all of the evaluation pilots found the sidestick to \nbe a viable controller and that the aircraft was safe to fly with a degraded control \nsystem (i.e. with the SCAS turned off). The pilots even reported that some tasks \ncould be performed with more precision with the sidestick controller than with the \nconventional center stick.\nWhile the sidestick investigation successfully achieved its objectives, the V-22 \nOsprey was nonetheless configured with a center stick control. However, the side\xad\nstick controller continues to be considered by the V-22 Project Office for future \napplication to the tilt rotor aircraft.\nACOUSTICS\nBy the late 1970s, communities adjacent to airports and heliports had become \nquite sensitive to the noise generated by aircraft operations, in particular, to the \ndisturbing character of the sound of rotorcraft noise. Therefore, if the tilt rotor were \nto be used as a civil transport aircraft, it was important to document its noise in the \nterminal area. In addition, it was necessary to establish a tilt rotor noise database \nfor various flight modes and operating conditions for use in the development of \nprediction methodology. The XV-15 became the test bed for a wide range of tilt \nrotor acoustics studies.\nSome very limited initial noise data were obtained with the XV-15 at Bell and \nconsisted of only a few data points acquired during early hover tests. The next \nopportunity to measure tilt rotor noise occurred during hover performance testing \nat Ames in February and March 1981. An array of 16 microphones was distributed \naround a selected hover point to fully document the noise around the aircraft. The \nresulting acoustic data (refer to footnote 34) [not included] surprisingly showed that \nthe noise varied by a few decibels around the aircraft, rather than remaining nearly \nconstant. An explanation was later provided by Professor Al George of Cornell \nUniversity[,] who postulated that this was caused by the reingestion of the turbu\xad\nlent fountain flow (revealed during the flow visualization test) into the proprotor \nover the root end of the wing.\nSeveral subsequent tests were conducted to explore the sound generated dur\xad\ning flyover or terminal approach conditions. The first was conducted at Crows \nLanding in September 1982 by a NASA/Army team and again in April 1986 with \nsupport from Bell. The NASA[-]operated radar-coupled laser tracker was used', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n786\nCONTROL\nControl power—Control moment per inch \nof stick deflection in the near hovering con\xad\nfiguration for the tilt-wing aircraft was con\xad\nsidered marginal in yaw, adequate in pitch, \nand excessive in roll. In the paper by John \nP. Reeder, values of control power are given \nfor the tilt-wing and tilt-duct aircraft in the \nhovering configuration.\nAngular velocities in roll—Maximum roll \nvelocities encountered in hovering flight on \nthe tilt-wing test bed, according \nto existing criteria, are greater \nthan is desirable. No reason was \nfound for not reducing materi\xad\nally the control power in roll; \nan alternate solution, however, \nwhich would permit retaining the \nmoment available, would be to use a \ndamper on the control stick.

In this range \nif the controls are fixed the helicopter will soon nose up, slow down, and slide back\xad\nwards with resulting yawing motions and control difficulties.\nObservations Particularly Concerning Hovering: Thus far only the forward \nflight characteristics have been discussed. Hovering, of course, precedes and fol\xad\nlows all forward flight and is the outstanding reason for the existence of helicopter \ntypes. We feel, however, that at present the problems associated with hovering in \nthis particular type are more indefinite than in forward flight, that they tend to \ndisappear with a little flight practice, and that they don’t affect its general utility to \nthe extent that limitations on night and instrument flying do.\nOne of the problems which the trainee must overcome in a helicopter of this \ntype and size is the high control sensitivity in roll or the high rate of roll per unit \nstick displacement. This sensitivity can lead to over controlling which results in a \nshort-period, pilot-induced lateral oscillation. It is caused, apparently, by the pilot’s \nlag in removing control following response of the machine. The result can be lik\xad\nened to what occurs with an auto-pilot having improper follow-up. It might be well \nto point out here that with constant ratio of control stick displacement to cyclic \nfeathering the rolling velocity obtained will vary inversely as the diameter, or, the \nsmaller machine will roll the faster. Thus sensitivity becomes less of a problem with \nlarger machines.\nThe forces the pilot encounters in deflecting the stick can accentuate or mini\xad\nmize his impression of the sensitivity. The pilot should first be able to trim steady \nforces to zero. He should also have a force gradient opposing displacement of the \nstick in order that he can properly judge the control being applied. The control force \ngradient centers the stick when it is released, reducing the lag in the follow-up process \nand reducing the required pilot effort. With one set of blades on the R-4 the lateral \ngradient was satisfactory, but with other blades peculiar characteristics appeared. In \nsome cases the initial force change with deflection was proper but the force returned \nto zero or even reversed as rolling velocity developed. From the pilot’s standpoint \nthis is very undesirable. The following slide (Figure 4 [not reproduced]) illustrates \nthe character of the lateral forces immediately following stick displacement for two \ndifferent rotors. Rotor A illustrates the type of transient force variation considered \nunsatisfactory, while the force variation for rotor B was considered acceptable.\nIt is interesting to note at this time that the longitudinal forces immediately \nfollowing abrupt stick displacement differed in character from the lateral forces. \nThese are shown on the next slide (Figure 5 [not reproduced]). In this case neither \nrotor A nor rotor B showed acceptable characteristics, although the pilot reported \nthe characteristics of rotor A noticeably inferior to those of rotor B.\nIn another case abrupt stick motions were found to cause forces perpendicular \nto the direction of motion which tended to whirl the stick in the direction of rotor', '665\nDocument 5-44 (a–b)\nLongitudinal Stability in Forward Flight: During the course of the perfor\xad\nmance tests, considerable flying was done at relatively high speeds, approaching the \nlimits imposed by blade stalling. It was found quite difficult to hold steady condi\xad\ntions because of a strong tendency of the machine to diverge in pitch, creating the \nimpression of balancing on a ball. This characteristic seemed far more pronounced \nwith some of the rotors tested than with others, but was always troublesome. Upward \npitching was most troublesome as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling, \nwhich added to the difficulties because it increased the tendency to pitch up and \nwas accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. The forward \ndisplacement of the control from trim necessary to check some of these pitching \nmotions suggested that a short delay in applying corrective control would allow a \nmaneuver severe enough that control would be lost. Although there seemed ample \ncontrol to stop downward pitching, an uncomfortable amount of forward control \nwas again required in order to check the subsequent upward pitching. These char\xad\nacteristics suggested a pronounced type of instability.\nThe tendency to depart from the trim speed and the necessity of applying \nappreciable control deflection against a pitching maneuver involving acceleration, \ninitiated either by control or by external disturbances, is apparent throughout the \nspeed range normally used in forward flight. It becomes much less pronounced, \nhowever, at the lower speeds.\nShortly after the embryo pilot experiences forward flight, he is impressed with \nthe necessity for having to constantly fly the helicopter. At first thought the reasons \nfor this situation are not clear. It is common knowledge that a flapping rotor tilts \nto the rear if speed is increased, thus tending to cause the machine to return to \nthe original speed. This condition constitutes stability of the rotor with respect to \nspeed. Wind-tunnel tests of the R-4 fuselage have shown it to be unstable, but this \ninstability is evidently outweighed by the rotor stability just discussed, inasmuch \nas measurements of stick position have shown that the stick does move forward to \ntrim at increasing steady speeds. Furthermore, observation and measurements have \nindicated that the static stick-force gradient with respect to speed is small, but has \nbeen either unstable, neutral, or stable, depending upon the pitching moments of \nthe particular blades and upon the bungee configuration, without greatly altering \nthe pilot’s overall impression of instability. The source of the difficulty, therefore, \ncannot be either stick-fixed or stick-free instability with speed.\nThe somewhat obvious conclusion is that the pilot’s impressions are a result \nof the helicopter’s instability with angle of attack. There are at least two logical \nsources for its instability with angle of attack. The first results from the flapping \nof the rotor. If the helicopter rotor is subjected to an angle-of-attack change in \nforward flight, then for constant rpm the advancing blades are subjected to a \ngreater upward accelerating force than the retreating blades because the product of \nangle-of-attack change and velocity squared is greater on the advancing side. The \nresulting flapping motion will then tilt the disk in the direction of the tip-speed']","
The concerns with the sidestick controller were whether it would be able to provide the same level of control as the conventional center stick, and whether it could perform adequately during ""degraded"" flight control system conditions (such as a malfunctioning or battle-damaged control system). To address these concerns, a piloted simulation evaluation and a full flight investigation of a 3-axis sidestick controller on an XV-15 TRRA were performed for both normal and ""degraded"" flight control system conditions. The sidestick controller was installed on the XV-15 TRRA because it had bulging side windows and an uncluttered side console which provided room for a functional installation, including an adjustable arm rest. Initial sidestick control system gains and sensitivities were established using the Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) and a refined simulation math model based on the one originally developed in the early stages of the XV-15 project. These control law parameters were adjusted during XV-15 installation/hangar checks, and the resulting configuration was taken into the flight program."
Question: What is the mission objective of the ACE spacecraft and which scientific instruments are used to achieve these objectives?,"The mission objective of the Geotail spacecraft is to study the structure and dynamics of the long tail region of Earth's magnetosphere, which is created on the nightside of Earth by the solar wind. The spacecraft carries scientific instruments such as the magnetic fields measurement monitor (MGF), low energy particles experiment (LEP), electric field monitor (EFD), energetic particles and ion composition experiment (EPIC), high-energy particle monitors (HEP), plasma wave instrument (PWI), and comprehensive plasma instrument (CPI) to achieve these objectives. During active periods, the tail couples with the near-Earth magnetosphere, and often releases energy that is stored in the tail, thus activating auroras in the polar ionosphere. Geotail's elliptical orbit allows it to perform numerous lunar flybys, some closer than the distance at which the Soviet Luna 3 took the first pictures of the farside of the Moon. The spin-stabilized spacecraft (20 rpms) is designed with a pair of 100-meter tip-to-tip antennae and two 6-meter-long masts. The spacecraft's 14th and last flyby of the Moon occurred on 25 October 1994, and as a result, placed the spacecraft in orbits with progressively lower apogees. In November 1994, Geotail's apogee was 50 Re and by February 1995, it was down to 30 Re. The lower orbit was designed to allow the spacecraft to begin the second part of its mission, to study magnetotail sub-storms near Earth. Later in the decade, Geotail's orbit was adjusted so that it passed just inside Earth's magnetosphere's boundary plane on the dayside. In 2012, the spacecraft celebrated twenty years of continuous operation, and in 2014, despite having an original lifetime of only four years, was still sending back data on the formation of auroras, the nature of energy funneled from the Sun into near-Earth space, and the ways in which Earth's magnetic field lines move and rebound, thus producing explosive bursts that affect our magnetic environment.","['197\n1997\n186\nACE\nNation: USA (71)\nObjective(s): Sun–Earth L1 Lagrange Point\nSpacecraft: ACE\nSpacecraft Mass: 752 kg\nMission Design and Management: NASA / GSFC\nLaunch Vehicle: Delta 7920-8 (no.

The \nSOHO and Cluster missions, part of ESA’s Solar \nTerrestrial Science Programme (STSP), are ESA’s \ncontributions to the International Solar Terres\xad\ntrial Physics (ISTP) program, which has involved \nthe work of other spacecraft such as Wind and \nACE, which, like SOHO, operate in the vicinity \nof the Sun–Earth L1 point. NASA contributed \nthree instruments on SOHO as well as launch and \nflight operations support. About two months after \nlaunch, on 14 February 1996, SOHO was placed at \na distance of 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in \nan elliptical Lissajous orbit around the L1 libration \npoint where it takes approximately six months to \norbit L1 (while the L1 itself orbits the Sun every \n12 months). The spacecraft returned its first image \non 19 December 1995 and was fully commissioned \nfor operations by 16 April 1996. SOHO finished its \nplanned two-year study of the Sun’s atmosphere, \nsurface, and interior in April 1998. Communica\xad\ntions with the spacecraft were interrupted for four \nmonths beginning 24 June 1998, after which the \nspacecraft was apparently spinning, losing electri\xad\ncal power, and not pointing at the Sun. After inten\xad\nsive search efforts, by 25 September, controllers \nmanaged to regain control and return SOHO to \n“normal mode.” Because of the failure of onboard \ngyros, ESA developed a special gyroless method of \norientation (which used reaction wheels) that was \nsuccessfully implemented beginning 1 February \n1999.

There would be no magnetometer, no energetic particle investiga\xad\ntion, no radio wave experiment, or the like; the mission remained focused on sample \nreturn and the supporting GIM and GEM.18\nTo measure the bulk concentration of solar wind, a team led by Roger Weins and \nBeth Nordholt, both of Los Alamos National Laboratory, developed an ion concen\xad\ntrator assembly intended to filter out light protons and alpha particles, concentrating \nheavier ions onto a special collector tile under the stack of collector trays. By repelling \nhydrogen, which composes 99 percent of the solar system, the signal of nitrogen and \noxygen would be improved significantly, with concentrations designed to be increased \nby a factor of 20 while filtering out elements that could obscure later measurements. \nUsing the solar wind flow speed and temperature measurements from GIM and GEM, \nthe internal ion optics of the concentrator could be optimized for varying conditions \nof the solar wind.19\nMission Design\nAfter launch, the spacecraft would travel 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from \nEarth to Lagrange Point 1, a stable point between Earth and the Sun where gravity is \nbalanced between them. Because of this gravity balance, the Genesis spacecraft, like the \nAdvanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and other missions, could be kept relatively \nstationary, in a small halo orbit around that point in space, with only the occasional \nneed for small station-keeping adjustments from onboard thrusters. After several years \nof collection, the spacecraft would fire its thrusters and return to Earth, deploying the \nsample return capsule for midair capture by one of two helicopters standing by at the \nU.S. Air Force’s Utah Testing and Training Range.

The spin-stabilized spacecraft (20 rpms) \nwas designed with a pair of 100-meter tip-to-tip \nantennae and two 6-meter-long masts. On its fifth \norbit around Earth, near apogee, on 8 September \n1992, the spacecraft flew by the Moon at a range \nof 12,647 kilometers. The flyby raised apogee \nfrom 426,756 kilometers to 869,170 kilometers. \nSuch flybys continued almost every month sub\xad\nsequent to that, and ultimately raised the space\xad\ncraft’s apogee to 1.4 million kilometers. During \nthese orbits, Geotail observed the magnetotail’s far \nregion (from 80 to 220 times the radius of Earth \nor “Re”). Geotail’s 14th and last flyby of the Moon \noccurred on 25\xa0October 1994 at a range of 22,445 \nkilometers and as a result, placed the spacecraft \nin orbits with progressively lower apogees. In \nNovember 1994, Geotail’s apogee was 50 Re and \nby February 1995, it was down to 30 Re. The lower \norbit was designed to allow the spacecraft to begin \nthe second part of its mission, to study magnetotail \nsub-storms near Earth. During these orbits, peri\xad\ngee was about 10 Re, while the orbital inclination \nto the ecliptic plane was about –7° in order that \nthe apogee would be located in the magnetotail’s \nneutral plane during the winter solstice. Later in \nthe decade, Geotail’s orbit was adjusted so that it \npassed just inside Earth’s magnetosphere’s bound\xad\nary plane on the dayside. In 2012, the spacecraft \ncelebrated twenty years of continuous operation, \nand in 2014, despite having an original lifetime \nof only four years, was still sending back data on \nthe formation of auroras, the nature of energy fun\xad\nneled from the Sun into near-Earth space, and the \nways in which Earth’s magnetic field lines move \nand rebound, thus producing explosive bursts that \naffect our magnetic environment.']","
The mission objective of the ACE spacecraft is to study space-borne energetic particles from the Sun-Earth L1 libration point, about 1.4 million kilometers from Earth. The spacecraft was launched to investigate the matter ejected from the Sun to establish the commonality and interaction between the Sun, Earth, and the Milky Way galaxy. In addition, ACE also provides real-time space weather data and advanced warning of geomagnetic storms.

The ISS is a unique scientific platform that has enabled \nmore than 3,600 researchers in 106 countries and areas to conduct more than 2,500 experiments in \nmicrogravity through February 2018—and the research continues.\nSince November 2, 2000, the ISS has maintained a continuous human presence in space. Research began \non the orbiting laboratory even before it was occupied. In 2011, when ISS assembly was complete, the focus \nshifted to fully utilizing the lab to promote scientific research, technology development, space exploration, \ncommerce, and education.\nThe ISS began as an engineering achievement that evolved over a decade. Its components were built \nin various countries around the world. The coordination required to accomplish this without testing the fully \nassembled structure on Earth allowed us to learn a vast amount about the construction of large, complex \ntechnical systems. This international achievement illustrates the cooperative teamwork required to create \nan international partnership that has continued to flourish and serve as a model for international cooperation. \nAlthough each ISS partner has distinct research goals, the unified goal is to extend the knowledge gleaned \nto benefit all humankind. The research achievement of the space station has been demonstrated \nthrough the application of its technical capabilities (similar to those in ground-based laboratories) to the \nunique conditions of the low-Earth orbit environment, which has consistently achieved meaningful scientific \nresults. Subsequently, the economic achievement of the space station has been realized through use \nof its technical capabilities as well as changes to contracting mechanisms, which have given rise to new \ncompanies, patents, and products.\nValue of the PlatformFour icons indicating the Values of the Platform: The Engineering Achievement, The International Achievement, The Research Achievement, and The Economic Achievement\nIn the first edition of this book, released in 2012, the scientific, technological, and educational \naccomplishments of ISS research that impact life on Earth were summarized through a compilation of stories. \nThe many benefits being realized were primarily in the areas of human health, Earth observations and disaster \nresponse, and global education.\nThe second edition, released in 2015, included updates on the first edition benefit areas (including new \nstories in those areas), plus the addition of two new benefit areas: economic development of space and \ninnovative technology. \nThis third edition includes updates to the second edition’s five benefit areas (including new stories in those \nareas), plus two new sections on the economic valuation and scientific valuation of space station research.', '25\nSummation Valuation Findings\nTaken as a whole, the examples presented throughout this section illustrate the many pathways \nthat are possible for the generation of value from the conduct of research and technology \ndevelopment activities in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Even the procurement mechanisms employed \ncan be tailored to maximize the transfer of expertise needed to confidently conduct business \nin space and encourage economic development.\nIn the table that follows, examples are provided for the humankind and economic benefits generated \nby the International Space Station (ISS). Navigant Consulting, Inc. findings were the primary source \nfor these value examples, with the exception of two cases. Details for Amgen and Tropical Cyclone \nwere already available and therefore not assigned to Navigant for analysis. When practical and \nuseful, details of the findings were further vetted through the international partners and commercial \nentities associated. \nThe second table provides descriptions of the commercial research facilities on the ISS. The majority \nof these facilities (14/15) entered service after the assembly of the space station was completed \nin 2011, with more than half (8/15) coming on-line in the 1.5 years leading up to this publication \n(2017-2018). Thus, it is important to remember that the cases presented derived from research \nactivities are early-return benefits. As more time passes, and research efforts continue unabated, \nthe number and value of the benefits returned to Earth will continue to grow. \nFindings and Providers\nThe Summaries of Valuation Findings table starting \non the next page summarizes the valuation findings \navailable to the authors. The findings presented \nshow how value is derived not only from the \nplanned research, but also from the engineering \naccomplishments and technology required to \noperate the space station, perform research, and \nmaintain a safe living environment for the crew. \nThe ISS Commercial Research Providers table lists \nsome of the key commercially managed research \nfacilities onboard the space station. Information \nprovided indicates the year of operational start-\nup as well as a brief description of the facility \ncapabilities. A quick perusal of this table illustrates \nthat commercially managed facilities are a recent \ndevelopment, with the first such facility beginning \noperations in 2010. Also, the fact that three of these \nfacilities came on line in the first half of 2018, literally \nas this section was being drafted, accurately portrays \nthe ongoing proliferation of such facilities over the \nnext several years.']","1.

"How have the latest autogiros evolved in appearance compared to those of 1925, in terms of their fuselage, undercarriage, tail, ailerons, and rotary wings?","The latest autogiros, such as the upcoming ""Autogiro"" No. 5, have undergone significant changes in appearance compared to those of 1925. While they still retain the basic principles of the autogiro system, they have evolved to better suit the needs of the new system. The undercarriage is wider, the fuselage shorter, and the tail is of a peculiar design. The ailerons are now supported by small fixed wings, which provide better stability and control. The rotary wings have also undergone improvements, with a smooth skin, local strength to prevent deformation, and flexibility in a plane perpendicular to that of rotation. These improvements have increased the efficiency and carrying capacity of the autogiro, making it a perfected airplane that is not affected by loss of speed. The upcoming ""Autogiro"" No. 5 will compete with its elder brother, the airplane, and will have the humanitarian purpose of reducing the number of accidents and human lives sacrificed in the fight for the conquest of the air.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n554\nsecond. I will deal later in this paper with the theory of the purely vertical descent, \none of the more discussed performances of the autogiro.\nThe latest autogiros have an appearance rather different from those of 1925. \nThey are no longer transformed \naeroplanes; and fuselage, under\xad\ncarriage and tail have been grad\xad\nually transformed to suit better \nthe necessities of the new system \n(Figs. 1 and 2). The undercar\xad\nriage is wider, the fuselage shorter \nand the tail is of a peculiar \ndesign. Also the ailerons, which \nin 1925 were fixed on a transverse \nbeam or stick, are now supported \nby small fixed wings, such as the \nbottom plane of a sesquiplane.\nThe rotary wings are of a dif\xad\nferent shape and construction. \nTheir main characteristics are \nthe smoothness of the skin, the \nlocal strength of the same to pre\xad\nvent deformation under very high \nunitary loads and the consider\xad\nable flexibility of the whole blade \nin a plane perpendicular to that \nof\xa0rotation.\nThe \nblades \nare \nhinged \nto a central hub as in the old \nmachines, so as to allow free \nflapping in flight. A secondary \nhinge perpendicular to the first is \nalso provided, allowing a certain freedom between two consecutive blades. Those \ntwo articulations give, by the way, the maximum degree of freedom that rotary \nwings can have without becoming unstable with relation to the axis of rotation in \nhorizontal\xa0motion.\nIn these machines the tail acts as self-starter to the rotary blades prior to take-\noff. The slipstream of the propeller is deflected upwards and the rotary blades are \nforced in turn to a flapping movement which is transformed by aerodynamical \nreaction into circular motion. Sixty to seventy per cent. of the flying revolutions are \nobtained in no wind by this means and take-off is possible as soon as the horizontal \nspeed corresponding to the position of the machine on the ground is attained.Photo of an autogiro.

It happened in 1929 through the efforts of \nU.S. rotary-wing pioneer Harold F. Pitcairn, who had met with Cierva several \ntimes in London four years earlier. Impressed with the Spanish engineer’s inven\xad\ntion, Pitcairn switched from helicopter development to the autogiro, obtaining the \nAmerican rights to Cierva’s invention in 1929 and creating the Autogiro Company \nof America (ACA) to develop and promote it. Quickly, Pitcairn licensed it to Kellett \nAircraft as well as to his own construction firm, Pitcairn Aircraft, both located in \nthe Philadelphia area.\nPitcairn himself exemplified the switch from helicopters to autogiros and back \nto helicopters again discussed in our text. In the early 1920s, he had worked along \nwith fellow rotary-wing enthusiast Agnew Larsen on a novel helicopter incorporat\xad\ning a system of adjustable vanes placed in the slipstream (outboard of the 70-percent \nradius) in the hope of counteracting torque and avoiding some of the problems asso\xad\nciated with ground effects. Although he visited Cierva while in England in 1925, \nhis main reason for going there was to enter (through Larsen) a British helicopter \ncompetition. But he came away from that visit more interested in the autogiro, \nthough he continued to conduct helicopter experiments into 1928, dropping his \nantitorque vanes in favor of a jet-driven rotor. A major aspect of this test program \nby 1928, however, centered on the transition of a helicopter in flight from powered \nlift to descent via autorotation, a concept for which Cierva was the main influence. \nIt was this work that led Pitcairn to drop his helicopter work and focus on the \nautogiro. Again, the reason for the switch to the autogiro in the late 1920s seems \nto have been the technical frustrations blocking the design of a true helicopter and \nthe desire for what at the time appeared to be a more practical machine. As early \nas 1920, Pitcairn had told a friend that he wanted “a single-rotored helicopter” but \nthat he did not care if it had a propeller out front or not.\nAs the 1930s proceeded, developments in the technology of rotary-wing flight \nbrought Pitcairn back to the matter of helicopters. His Autogiro Company of \nAmerica patented several hundred inventions, many of them—as lengthy lawsuits \ndemonstrated—directly applicable to helicopters. After building autogiros under \nlicense from Pitcairn, the Kellett brothers went on to build helicopters. They later \nsold out to Hughes Aircraft, which, thanks to a team of Kellett engineers who went \nto California with the business (such as Richard H. Prewitt, Paul Hovgard, Dave', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n532\nDocument 5-36 (a–b)\n(a) Juan de la Cierva, “The Development of the Autogyro,” \nJournal of the Royal Aeronautical Society (January 1926): 8–29.\n(b) Juan de la Cierva, “The Development of the Autogiro,” \nJournal of the Royal Aeronautical Society \n(November 1930): 902–921.\nIn the early 1920s, the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva (1895–1936) intro\xad\nduced the world to the “autogiro,” a word that Cierva himself coined and that was \noriginally a proprietary term for just the Cierva machine. The autogiro (British \nspelling, “autogyro”) was not a helicopter, but a different type of rotorcraft that was \ncapable of short takeoff and landing (STOL) but not hovering. It differed from the \nhelicopter in that its rotor was not powered but turned automatically (i.e., autorota\xad\ntion) from the very motion of the craft through the air. The Cierva autogiro began \nmaking successful flights in 1923. Soon other inventors came to design their own \nautogiros. Some of them showed good enough performance that manufacturers in \ndifferent countries started building variations of the machine. By the mid-1920s, \nwhen Cierva gave the following speech to the British Royal Aeronautical Society, \nsome observers felt that the autogiro represented a dominant flight technology of \nthe future. Proponents felt that the hybrid rotorcraft offered the best means to \nachieve short-field landings and takeoffs plus deliver the safe and effective “low and \nslow” performance that could lead to what many enthusiasts wanted from general \naviation aircraft—that was, door-to-door aerial commuting.\nThe majority of those who witnessed Señor de la Cierva’s presentation on his \ninvention of the autogiro at the third meeting, first half, second session of the \nBritish Royal Aeronautical Society in late 1925 (the first of two documents in the \nstring below) seem to have come away quite impressed. As readers will see at the \nend of the document below, the master of ceremonies who opened the question-\nand-answer session following Cierva’s talk began by saying, “I think we are all \nagreed that we have seen to-night one of the most wonderful inventions since the \noriginal invention of the aeroplane itself.” This opinion would spread far and wide \nfrom the mid-1920s well into the 1930s, a period when this class of rotorcraft “far \noutshone the helicopters of the period” (Liberatore, Helicopters Before Helicopters, \np. 71). In late 1925, for example, the British Air Ministry dropped its support of \nLouis Brennan’s experimental work on a helicopter. This was one year after the Air \nMinistry had offered a prize of £50,000 (about $250,000 today) if anybody could \nproduce a helicopter capable of doing a short list of rather simple things. The list \nincluded attaining an altitude of 650 meters (2,130 feet), climbing straight up and', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n578\nby taxiing around the field. \nAt one time a mechanical \ndevice was developed for the \nsame purpose. A drum was \nfixed to the rotor, carrying \na cable which was fastened \nat one end to an anchorage \non the field. As the machine \npicked up ground speed \nand moved away, this cable \npulled the rotor around as a \nstring turns a top. But this \nwas an expedient and not a \nsolution to the problem.\nConsiderable \nsuccess \nwas secured with a starter \nwhich utilized the slip-\nstream of the propeller to \nturn the rotor. A biplane tail \nwas built which could be set \nby the pilot so that the cur\xad\nrent of air from the propel\xad\nler was deflected upwards \nto strike against the rotor \nblades and turn them. With \nthis device a sufficient speed could be developed in the rotor without running the \nmachine around the ground before taking off. Until this was done the Autogiro was \nhandicapped by the need for plenty of space for the take-off, though it could land \nin a very small area.\nBut the mechanical starter proved much more satisfactory, when American \nengineers developed one of sufficiently light weight so that it did not unduly burden \nthe Autogiro or reduce its useful load too much. The starter now in use on the 300 \nhorse power Autogiros weighs about 65 pounds; the one so far developed for lighter \ncraft weighs about 45 pounds. It operates under the pilot’s control, using power \nfrom the engine, and it brings the rotor to flying speed in about thirty\xa0seconds.\nThe addition of an efficient starter enables the Autogiro to get out of small \nfields as well as into them. It could do so before, so far as its length of take-off run \nand steepness of climb were concerned, but could not do so while it needed consid\xad\nerable space to taxi around in order to put the rotor in motion.\nThe development of the Autogiro in America received gratifying recognition \nin March, 1931, when the Department of Commerce awarded it an approved Type \nCertificate, the highest rating as a flying machine for public use and commercial Two photos of autogiros in flight.

Cuatro Vientos \nAirdrome, February 1, 1923.\n(Signed) Emilio Herrera,\nChief of the Laboratory,\nSporting Commissioner of the F.A.I.\nThe “Autogiro” has ceased \nto be a scientific curiosity and \nhas become something which \ncan be developed commer\xad\ncially. The tests of last January \nhave proved that it can fly, that \nit is more stable than an air\xad\nplane and that it can alight ver\xad\ntically and without speed. We \nhave now to determine its exact \nefficiency, which should be at \nleast 90% that of an airplane.\nIn the workshops of the \nIndustrial \nSchool, \nwhere \nthe most delicate parts of \n“Autogiros” Nos. 2, 3 and 4 \nwere constructed, “Autogiro” No. 5 is at present being built, under the supervision \nof La Cierva. This aircraft will have improvements which will increase its efficiency \nand carrying capacity. It will be able to carry a passenger and to make long flights, \nwhich it would not have been prudent to attempt with the previous aircraft, built \nsolely for experimental purposes. “Autogiro” No. 4 was the last of the experimental \nseries, and No. 5 will be the first of the commercial series. Those who have followed \nits progress will not go to the airport simply to see it fly and descend vertically \nwithout an appreciable forward speed, but to see it compete with its elder brother, \nthe airplane.\nThe “Autogiro” is not a helicopter nor an aeronautic freak pretending to solve a \ndifficult problem of mechanics, but is a perfected airplane, although not designed \nwith the sporting purpose of increasing speed nor with the commercial object of \nenlarging the radius of action, but with the humanitarian purpose of reducing to a \nminimum the number of accidents and the number of human lives sacrificed in the \nfight for the conquest of the air.\nNearly all aviation accidents are due to loss of speed, which diminishes the lift\xad\ning force and leaves the airplane subject to the force of gravity. The “Autogiro” is \nnot affected by loss of speed. An engine failure, a sudden “nose up” or a very sharp \nturn may interrupt its horizontal flight and make it descend toward the ground, Phot of autogiro Number 4 flying at Cuatro Vientos, January 31, 1923.\nFIG. 8.\u2002 Autogiro No. 4.

The latest autogiros have an appearance rather different from those of 1925. They are no longer transformed aeroplanes. The fuselage is shorter, the undercarriage is wider, and the tail is of a peculiar design. The ailerons, which in 1925 were fixed on a transverse beam or stick, are now supported by small fixed wings, such as the bottom plane of a sesquiplane. The rotary wings are of a different shape and construction. Their main characteristics are the smoothness of the skin, the local strength of the same to prevent deformation under very high unitary loads, and the considerable flexibility of the whole blade in a plane perpendicular to that of rotation. The blades are hinged to a central hub as in the old machines, so as to allow free flapping in flight. A secondary hinge perpendicular to the first is also provided, allowing a certain freedom between two consecutive blades. Those two articulations give the maximum degree of freedom that rotary wings can have without becoming unstable with relation to the axis of rotation in horizontal motion."
"Question: ""What is the importance of helium for airships and what measures are being taken to preserve the sources of supply?""","The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) recommends that the Government acquire and seal for future use the best helium-producing gas fields, as in helium, the United States has exclusive possession of a valuable adjunct to national defense which will be wasted unless conservation is provided for without delay. The known supply of helium is limited, and it is escaping into the atmosphere at an estimated rate sufficient to fill four large airships weekly. The progress in Great Britain, Germany, and Italy in developing airships has not been perfected, but the line of development is reasonably clear. The application of the refrigeration process to obtain helium has not been perfected, but the line of development is reasonably clear. The Bureau of Mines is carrying out certain developments which promise to solve the production problem. The necessity for the location of new supplies of helium and the adoption of proper measures for conservation and development still remains. Steps have been taken by the Bureau of Mines leading toward the development of a large new field in northwest Texas. This field is practically untouched, and if its entire supply can be exploited in an economical manner, as planned, processing all the gas, it is estimated that it contains a quantity of helium-bearing gas amply sufficient to serve the Nation’s needs for several generations. Progress in Great Britain, Germany, and Italy in developing airships has not been perfected, but the line of development is reasonably clear. The progress in Great Britain has been good, and the data revealed by the report of the air delegates to the conference show that Great Britain has developed her airship program with great care and very thoroughly. An effort was made to interest several of the colonies in the establishment of mooring masts. Apparently Australia, Canada, and South Africa are showing considerable interest in establishing such masts. It was reported that a site for a mast has already been selected in Canada. The erection of an airship shed at Karachi, India, is well under way, while the mooring masts at Karachi; Ismallia, Egypt; and Cardington, England, are completed. At the Imperial Conference held in England in October, 1926, emphasis was laid upon the importance of air transport and a system of imperial air-communication. Airships were considered to play an important role in this matter.

The committee renews its recommendations then made, that \nthe development of airships be continued, and that sufficient funds be provided \nfor experimental work for the[] obtaining of definite information regarding the \nstrength qualities of materials and girders used in the construction of airships, \nand for the development and checking of the theories used in the general design \nof\xa0airships.\nAs the technique of airship construction has not as yet been developed in this \ncountry, the committee believes it advisable, in the interests of rapid and economi\xad\ncal progress, that the Government procure a rigid type of airship, either of German \nor British manufacture, embodying the latest developments, as far as possible, of \nboth countries. Such an airship is an indispensable part of our program, and should \nbe obtained to fill the vacancy caused by the loss of the ZR-2. The committee also \nrenews its recommendation that the present program for the construction of the \nZR-1 at Lakewood, N.J., be prosecuted with renewed vigor.\nDocument 5-2 (e), “Helium for Airships,” NACA Annual Report (1921), p. 22.\nHELIUM FOR AIRSHIPS\nHelium, next to hydrogen, is the lightest gas known. It has 92 percent of the \nlifting power of hydrogen and for military purposes possesses an inestimable advan\xad\ntage over hydrogen in that it is nonflammable. The natural-gas wells in the United \nStates afford a practical monopoly of the known sources of supply. According to \nthe latest estimates, helium is escaping into the atmosphere at the rate of one and \na quarter million cubic feet a day, or at a rate sufficient to fill four large airships a \nweek. At this rate, according to our present knowledge of helium-bearing gas, our \ngreat resources will have become dissipated within the next 20 years unless some \nappropriate measures are taken to preserve the sources of supply.\nThe refrigeration process is employed to obtain helium. In this process every \nconstituent present in the natural gas is liquefied except helium, which is expelled \ninto suitable containers for storage. The application of this process to the extraction \nof helium has not been perfected, but the line of development is reasonably clear. \nThe Army, the Navy, and the Bureau of Mines, acting in close cooperation (with \nthe limited funds available), are carrying out certain developments which promise \nto solve the production problem.\nThe Bureau of Mines is also conducting experiments to determine whether \nunderground-chamber storage is practicable and economical. If so, the problem', '79\nDocument 5-2 (a–s)\nfield will probably be limited but is large enough to be an important factor in the \npresent available supply.\nThe gas production in the Petrolia field which supplies the Fort Worth plant \nhas been somewhat improved by cleaning out wells. It has been found that many \nwells were badly filled and by the simple process of attaching orifice meters to each \nwell it has been possible to select the wells to be cleaned. This has led to a very grati\xad\nfying increase in the amount of raw gas supplied to the plant and a corresponding \nincrease in the production of helium.\nHowever, the necessity for the location of new supplies of helium and the \nadoption of proper measures for conservation and development still remained. \nAccordingly, steps have been taken by the Bureau of Mines leading toward the \ndevelopment of a large new field in northwest Texas. This field is practically \nuntouched[,] and if its entire supply can be exploited in an economical manner, as \nplanned, processing all the gas, it is estimated that it contains a quantity of helium-\nbearing gas amply sufficient to serve the Nation’s needs for several generations.\nProgress in Great Britain.—Good progress has been made on the construction of \nthe two 5,000,000-cubic-foot airships in Great Britain. These two airships have \nundergone numerous changes in design as work progressed, but it is understood \nthat they are expected to be ready for flight in the first half of 1928.\nThe erection of an airship shed at Karachi, India, is well under way, while the \nmooring masts at Karachi; Ismallia, Egypt; and Cardington, England, are completed.\nAt the Imperial Conference held in England in October, 1926, emphasis was \nlaid upon the importance of air transport and a system of imperial air-communica\xad\ntion.

Experiments have been conducted by the Bureau of \nMines with a view to the development of methods of production and storage, but \nas yet the problem of storage in large quantities has not been satisfactorily solved. \nBecause the known supply is limited, because it is escaping into the atmosphere \nat an estimated rate sufficient to fill four large airships weekly, and because of \nthe tremendously increased value and safety which the use of helium would give \nto airships, particularly in warfare, it is, in the opinion of the National Advisory \nCommittee for Aeronautics, the very essence of wisdom and prudence to provide \nfor the conservation of large reserves through the acquisition and sealing by the \nGovernment of the best helium-producing fields. Attention now being given to the \ndevelopment of types of airships to realize fully the advantages which the use of \nhelium would afford should be continued. Such development would give America \nadvantages, for purposes either of war or commerce, with which no other nation \ncould successfully compete.\nDocument 5-2 (d), “Airship Development,” \nNACA Annual Report (1921), pp. 21–22.\nAIRSHIP DEVELOPMENT\nGermany and England have produced the best demonstrations of the poten\xad\ntial value of rigid airships, both for military and commercial purposes. Germany, \nin particular, has demonstrated the practicability of commercial airship passenger \nservice. The French Government has laid out a progressive program of develop\xad\nment. France has two rigid airships of the Zeppelin type, which were acquired from \nGermany through the Reparations Commission. The present French program calls \nfor the early inauguration of a commercial airship line from Marseille or Toulon to \nAlgiers. In Italy, the semirigid type of airship has been developed, both for military \nand commercial purposes.\nAmerica’s first program of airship development contemplated the procuring by \nthe Navy of a rigid airship from England—the ill-fated R-38, known in this coun\xad\ntry as the ZR-2; the procuring by the Army of the Italian semirigid airship Roma; \nand the construction by the Navy at Lakewood[,] N.J., of the first American rigid \nairship, to be known as the ZR-1.\nThe disaster to the ZR-2 in Great Britain before delivery to this country \nthreatened for a time the discontinuance of airship development in America. The \nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, in a special resolution addressed to', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n74\nmay be resolved into one of conservation by the storage of helium in its natural \nstate. Helium for current uses, however, will continue to be stored in high-pressure \ncontainers until used.\nIn connection with the consideration of an airship development policy, the \ncommittee presents as the crystallized opinion of the Government experts who have \nstudied the helium problem that in helium the United States has exclusive posses\xad\nsion of a valuable adjunct to national defense which will be wasted unless conserva\xad\ntion is provided for without delay.\nThe National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics therefore recommends \nthat the Government acquire and seal for future use the best helium-producing \ngas fields; that such experiments be continued as are involved in the develop\xad\nment of an efficient and economical process for the extraction and repurification \nof helium; and that the Government continue experimental work in connection \nwith the development of airships, and inaugurate without delay the use of airships \ninflated with helium. With large reserves of helium and the development of types \nof airships to fully realize the advantages to be derived from the use of helium, \nAmerica would possess resources and knowledge with which no other nation could \nsuccessfully\xa0compete.\nDocument 5-2 (f), “The Electrostatic Problem of \nAirships,” NACA Annual Report (1921), p. 22.\nTHE ELECTROSTATIC PROBLEM FOR AIRSHIPS\nThe question of the danger to airships from static charges of electricity and \nfrom lightning was referred to the committee, and a large amount of data was col\xad\nlected. In the end the procedure adopted by the Navy Department was investigated \nand approved.\nDocument 5-2 (g), “Special Committee on Design of Army Rigid \nSemirigid Airship ‘RS-1’,” NACA Annual Report (1924), pp. 9–10.\nSPECIAL COMMITTEE ON DESIGN OF \nARMY SEMIRIGID AIRSHIP “RS-1”\nAt the request of the Army Air Service, the National Advisory Committee for \nAeronautics appointed a special subcommittee to examine and report on the design \nand construction of the Army semirigid airship known as the RS-1.

When \nthe airship is to be moved in or out of the shed, a second set of wheels mounted on \nthe stern beam is brought into play, and the airship, with stern beam attached, is \nmoved by a mobile mooring mast at the bow along straight lines of railroad track \ninto the shed. Other pieces of mechanical apparatus, notably winches, yaw-guy \nanchorages, and mooring-masthead mechanisms, have undergone improvements \nduring the year.\nThe Government helium plant near Amarillo, Tex., continues to supply \nincreasing quantities of helium at progressively decreasing costs. The problems of \nrepurification of helium which has become contaminated with hydrogen or with \na hydrocarbon fuel gas, are being given careful study. An experimental order has \nbeen placed for a new type of helium purity meter which, if successful, should \ngreatly facilitate the taking of helium readings. The instrument is of such type that \nit can be applied to each individual cell in a rigid airship and will give a continuous \nrecord of helium purities.\nDocument 5-2 (n), “Airships,” NACA Annual Report (1932), pp. 59–60.\nResearch with full-size airships has been confined largely to the evaluation and \nstudy of data obtained in the trial flights with the U.S. airship Akron. These data \nhave furnished much valuable and interesting information concerning the behavior \nof and forces on large airships under varied flight conditions. The measurements of \nover-all drag and local pressures on the hull and tail surfaces not only provide data \nof direct importance in connection with this particular airship but they also serve \nthe general purpose of providing a basis for determining the applicability of data \nobtained with models.\nThrough research with models, considerable progress has been made in studies \nconcerning two major aspects of the problem of airship drag. Theories regarding \nthe laws of frictional resistance on streamline shapes have been correlated with \nthe results of an investigation of the boundary layer on a 1/40-scale model of the \nU.S. airship Akron and have been found to be in good agreement with fact for the \nrange of scales attainable in the wind tunnel used in the investigation. Interference \ndrag caused by protuberances in contact with airship shapes has been studied in \nthe variable-density wind tunnel. In this wind tunnel the large scales attainable \ngive fair assurance that the comparative results are free from the effect of critical \nchanges in the nature of the boundary layer on the model and, consequently, are \nbelieved to be applicable to full-size airships. This wind tunnel is now engaged in a \nresearch concerning the effect of shape on airship drag.']","

Question: What are the features of the ladies' dressing room on the aircraft?,"The ladies' dressing room on the aircraft is designed to provide a comfortable and modern space for passengers. It is equipped with a hand lavatory with hot and cold running water, a dental lavatory, and a large double dressing table with four lights and two large plateglass mirrors. The dressing table also has two benches and receptacles for Kleenex, etc. A ladies' toilet compartment opens from this dressing room. Each toilet on the aircraft is equipped with a standard size toilet seat and is of the flushing type. The flushing water is the waste water from the hand and dental lavatories. When the lid is lowered, a cylinder is filled with this water, which discharges and flushes the toilet bowl. The contents are then dumped outside the aircraft. The ladies' dressing room is furnished in the modern style and is designed to provide a comfortable and luxurious space for passengers. The deluxe compartment is also furnished with a love seat, an occasional chair, a coffee table, a dressing table and writing desk, a dressing table seat, and a folding wash stand. The galley is equipped with an icebox, a steam table, and a bar which may be rigged up across the galley doorway. The furnishings and equipment per passenger for night operations on the Model 314 provide 22 square feet of deck space, 164 cubic feet of cabin volume, and 175 pounds of furnishings and equipment per passenger. This is a significant improvement from earlier aircraft, such as the Boeing Model 80-A, which provided 7.3 square feet of floor space, 45.7 cubic feet of cabin volume, and 47.5 pounds of furnishings and equipment per passenger. The seats on the Model 314 are of the davenport type, which are low, deep, and wide, with adjustable back cushions. The occasional chairs and seats in the dining salon are deeply upholstered and cushioned with rubberized curled hair. The intention has been to duplicate the types and comfort of the chairs and furnishings found in the passenger's own home. The berths are made up from the davenport type seats and are designed to be very comfortable, utilizing the four-inch-thick, rubberized, curled-hair seat cushions and backs as mattresses. Most of the","['347\nDocument 5-23 (a–c)\nfoodstuffs and galley supplies is 256 pounds[,] making a total of 490 pounds. In \naddition, there are two drinking fountains, one on each end of the passengers’ deck. \nIncidentally, the galley equipment was designed and built by Pan American\xa0Airways.\nThe ladies’ dressing room is furnished in the modern style and is equipped \nwith a hand lavatory with hot and cold running water, a dental lavatory and a large \ndouble dressing table complete with four lights, two large plateglass mirrors, two \nbenches, receptacles for Kleenex, etc. A ladies’ toilet compartment opens from this \ndressing room. Incidentally, each toilet on this ship is equipped with standard size \ntoilet seat and is of the flushing type. The flushing water is the waste water from the \nhand and dental lavatories. As the toilet top is raised, a cylinder is filled with this \nwater and when the lid is lowered this cylinder discharges the water, flushing the \ntoilet bowl[,] and then the contents are dumped outside the aircraft.\nThe men’s dressing room is fitted with two hand lavatories with hot and cold \nrunning water, one dental lavatory and, believe it or not, a stand up urinal. This \nurinal will no doubt be an interesting innovation to the passengers. A separate toilet \ncompartment opens off the men’s dressing room.\nThe interior decorations throughout the passenger deck are in keeping with \nthe present-day trend of modern design, simple, functional, and in refreshing color \narrangement. Fabrics for both upholstery and lining are interesting in texture and \ndesign and are all flameproofed. All compartment lining and soundproofing is \nquickly removable for inspection and cleaning and, therefore, can be kept in excel\xad\nlent condition.\nTime will not allow me to go further into the details of this interior, but there \ncan be no doubt to those who have seen the actual installation that the design objec\xad\ntive of unprecedented passenger comfort, spaciousness and luxury has been\xa0realized.\nAlthough safety appeared fourth on the list of design criteria, it was by no means \nthe least important and was, in fact, uppermost in our minds during the design and \nconstruction processes. No compromise with safety was ever made. Naturally, all \nmanufacturers and operators strive to make and operate their equipment as safe as \npossible and both the Pan American Airways and Boeing organizations set out to \nembody safety in the fundamental design and to make the 314 one of the safest air\xad\ncraft possible with present-day knowledge of the science of aviation. We believe we \nhave accomplished this aim, and in order to illustrate the extent and thoroughness \nof our endeavor along this line a few safety provisions will be\xa0discussed.\nNo doubt many of the items which will be mentioned have long since been \nconsidered and incorporated in certain equipment, but the thoroughness with \nwhich we have attacked them may be interesting.\nRoughly speaking, aircraft accidents come under two general headings—\nmechanical failures and personnel errors. Obviously, accidents under both these \nheadings are more or less the joint responsibility of the manufacturer and operator. \nTherefore, we as a manufacturer have attempted to reduce mechanical failures by \nproducing conservative structures; trouble free mechanical accessories; simple and', '357\nDocument 5-23 (a–c)\ncalculation of power and fuel required to fly under the conditions set by the naviga\xad\ntor and pilot; and the radio operator, who is assigned the responsibility of maintain\xad\ning contact with the ground stations and to furnish radio bearings to the navigator.\nThe control room design that was laid out for these functions had the unprec\xad\nedented dimensions of 21½ feet long by 9½ feet wide by 6 feet 1½ inches high. A \nfull size “mock-up” in wood was built and provided with dummy equipment so the \narrangements could all be tried out in advance. The pilots were given comfortable \nseats adjustable in many ways and were given only the essential instruments and \ncontrols, leaving other work to other crew members. The controls were arranged \non convenient stands beside the pilots. An interesting innovation was the remote \ncontrol system for the automatic gyropilot. At a comfortable position beside each \npilot, two little wheels were mounted at right angles to each other: one for making \nturns and one for operating the elevators. As simply as though he were operating an \narmchair control of a modern home radio set, either pilot could sit back and govern \nthe action of the ship by merely rotating the little wheels a few revolutions.\nThe navigator’s station, with navigating instruments and a chart desk large \nenough to accommodate full size nautical charts, was located just behind the first \npilot; and the master’s desk was given the position immediately aft of the navigator. \nThe radio operator was located behind the second pilot. Aft of this post the flight \nengineer’s station was placed, with an elaborate panel of instruments and controls \nfor power plant operation, thus relieving the pilots of this concern. The entire con\xad\ntrol room was thoroughly soundproofed so the men could talk with each other in \nconversational tones, although an interphone system is also provided.\nIn order to reduce maintenance in an aircraft, the designer strives to provide \ngood initial design that will require a minimum of attention and to provide good \naccess for inspection and repair to parts that will require maintenance. These fac\xad\ntors were given utmost attention in planning the Clipper. The greatest innovation \nin this direction was the provision of access into the wings and engine nacelles \nduring flight, by way of two doors in the control room leading to right and left \nwing passageways. Subsequent flight operations have shown again and again the \nadvantages of this engine accessibility. Likewise, oil tanks, valves, and the greater \nportion of the plumbing for the engine lubrication, deicer fluid, hydraulic oil, water \nvacuum and fuel systems were also made accessible in flight. This means that \ninspections may be made periodically during flight and any malfunction can be \nimmediately diagnosed.\nThe design objective of unusually large and luxurious passenger accommoda\xad\ntions in the Clipper was readily realizable because of the great space allowed in the \npassenger deck. The whole was divided into a series of adjoining passenger cabins, \nequipped with davenport-type seats convertible into upper and lower berths, deluxe \ncompartment with special furnishings and complete privacy, roomy and modern \ndressing rooms, a completely equipped galley, [and] a large centrally-located dining \nsalon and recreation center, where passengers can mix and enjoy social pastime.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n176\nto give you some little advice from our past experience. You will find that you do \nnot need any special dress, because life on board an airship is similar to staying in \na large hotel or on board a passenger liner. Lady passengers are well aware that a \ndozen frocks or gowns will weigh scarcely more than one suit of clothes for a man. \nBut the difference in climate at the port of departure and that of the port of arrival \nshould not be forgotten, and, therefore, it is advisable at all times to take with you \na light overcoat.\nThe modern central heating and ventilation system installed on board the air\xad\nship renders the change of climate almost imperceptible. One hint to the men; a \nlot of time is spent in looking out of the window at passing ships and other scenes \nof interest below. Many will find a comfortable cap an advantage. The wearing of \na dress-suit or dinner-jacket is, of course, quite optional. Nevertheless, we advise \nthat one dark suit should be carried in the personal baggage for convenient and \nsuitable evening wear. Passengers need not worry about writing materials. In the \ncomfortable writing and reading room they will find a plentiful supply of note-\npaper, picture post-cards, and attractive souvenirs [that] can be obtained from the \nsaloon stewards.\nTHE MONEY PROBLEM MADE EASY\nHow to avoid difficulties with the German foreign currency regulations.\nThe fare charged for the passage covers “full board” and tips. But naturally, \npassengers will want to purchase little odds and ends, such as souvenirs of the ship, \nan occasional bottle of wine from the excellent “cellar” on board, Eau de Cologne, \nchocolates, cigarettes or even a good Havana cigar.\nSometimes, a party of friends may wish to celebrate some special event with a \nbottle of champagne from the ship’s expertly chosen wine list. Often, a passenger \nmay wish to send a telegram from mid-air, half-way across the ocean. All these \nfacilities are at the passengers’ disposal. Passengers, of course, have their own indi\xad\nvidual tastes, and incur their various expenses accordingly. To facilitate the pas\xad\nsenger’s convenience and to eliminate minor troubles, the Company has created \na “Board Credit”, which permits of each passenger opening a personal “Credit \nAccount” for use on board ship, and in cases where the passenger intends to return \nby Airship after a short stay, may include a fixed sum in the currency of the country \nwhich you are visiting, sufficient to cover their daily expenses during their stay. \nThe German currency regulations permit you to open a “Credit Account” for any \nsum of money up to 30 Reich Marks per day, which experience has shown is ample \nto meet the needs of the average passenger. In fact, you will find when calculat\xad\ning your expenses, that you will need to be really extravagant to exceed this daily \nexpenditure, bearing in mind that your full board and tips, while in the Airship, are \nalready covered by the passage money. Of course, your “Credit Account” must be \nestimated and purchased before going on board, preferably, at the time of booking', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n342\nwith data furnished by the navigator. The flight engineer is responsible for the \nproper functioning of the powerplants, including the calculation of power and fuel \nrequired to fly under the conditions set by the navigator and the pilot. The radio \noperator is assigned the responsibility of maintaining contact with the ground sta\xad\ntions and to furnish radio bearings to the navigator.\nWith these duties in mind the Boeing engineers set out to design a control \ncabin to accommodate this crew in such a manner that they might operate most \nefficiently. The result is a control cabin which has an average head room of six feet \none and one-half inches, it is twenty-one feet four inches long and is nine feet six \ninches wide and which would put many a good ocean surface vessel to shame. At \nits forward end are located the two pilots’ stations with an aisle between which \nleads under the instrument board and through the collision bulkhead into the \nbow\xa0compartment.\nOn the left side of the control cabin just behind the first pilot’s station is the \nnavigator’s station. Still further aft on the same side is the watch officer’s seat and \ntable and the navigator’s seat. Immediately behind the second pilot’s station is a \nspiral staircase leading down to the passenger’s deck. Aft of this is located the radio \noperator’s station and still further toward the rear is the flight engineer’s station.\nRecently, during flight tests, eleven men were busily engaged taking test read\xad\nings and there was no crowding or inconvenience. The other day during a broad\xad\ncast, while still on the water but with all engines running, I counted seventeen men \nin the control cabin. It is believed that a brief description of these stations would \nbe of interest.\nThe pilots’ stations were designed to provide a maximum of comfort, visibility \nand simplicity. Comfort is obtained by making each pilot’s seat deeply upholstered \nand adjustable as to height, fore and aft position, and angle of back. In addition, \nthese seats are equipped with padded and upholstered arms which may be swung \nout of the way for easy entry. So that even a pilot with a bad case of gout could be \ncomfortable, the angle of the rudder pedal faces has been made adjustable, in addi\xad\ntion to a large range of fore and aft adjustment.\nBoth flight and powerplant controls are duplicated at each pilot’s station. The \nengine and trim tab controls provided for the first pilot are mounted on a stand \nlocated to the left of his seat, while a duplicate set of these controls is located to \nthe right of the second pilot’s seat. Mounted on each control stand are the eleva\xad\ntor, aileron, and rudder trim tab wheels, with indicators for each, four throttles, a \nmaster control lever for mixtures, a master control lever for the automatic manifold \npressure regulators, and a master control switch for the propeller speed controls. \nThis master propeller speed switch is, incidentally, mounted ingeniously on one of \nthe throttle levers in such a position that, with the hand on all throttles, this switch \nmay be easily operated in either direction by the pilot’s thumb.\nYou perhaps have noted that all the engine controls available to the pilots, \nexcept the throttles, are master controls: that is, controls which function at all', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n346\navailable in the dining salon and three in the deluxe compartment.

These figures have been increasing steadily as each \nnew aircraft is designed.\nA rough idea of these increases are shown by the following approximate com\xad\nparisons. A Boeing Model 80-A provided 7.3 square feet of floor space, 45.7 cubic \nfeet of cabin volume, and 47.5 pounds of furnishings and equipment per passenger. \nThese figures were, respectively, 8.0 square feet, 48.8 cubic feet, and 77.3 pounds for \nthe Model 247-D and 17.9 square feet, 112 cubic feet and 130 pounds per passenger \nfor night operations for the Model 307.

These comparisons \nare reflected in Table 9.1.81\nX-34 Lessons Learned and Observations \nNoted by Its Program Managers\nIn interviews with the author, several X-34 program/project managers and \nsenior NASA officials noted a number of “strategic” lessons learned and prob\xad\nlems faced by the X-34 effort. Robert E. Lindberg, Orbital’s first program \nmanager of the second X-34 program, stated that fixed-price agreements were \nnot the right arrangements for projects like the X-34 and that you need to \n“keep the project sold.”82 \nLindberg’s criticisms appear to have merit. Orbital was asked to make a \nnumber of changes that were not covered in the initial fixed-price cost esti\xad\nmates, and a number of engineers involved noted the need for continued \nsupport and encouragement in keeping the program moving forward. John R. \nLondon III, who also served as a NASA program manager, added that\n•\t the X-34 was miscast as a reusable launch vehicle, noting that it was \nactually a hypersonic research vehicle; \n•\t there was not enough funding for the program; and \n•\t changes late in the program, especially regarding redundancy, seri\xad\nously impacted the X-34.83', 'Promise Denied\n302\nnot to include continuation of the X-34 project in Space Launch Initiative \n(SLI) funding. At the same time, the report noted continuing flight readiness \nwork, as well as participation in NASA Marshall’s Configuration Control Board \nactivity. The report also stated that 485 comments on the Orbital restructuring \nproposal had been received.18 \nThe March 12 Aerospace report confirmed that the X-34 project had been \nofficially terminated on Thursday, March 8. The report stated further that\n[n]o decision has been made on what to do with the vehicles \n(A-1A, A-2, and A-3) and equipment. All of the hardware and \nspare parts are being collected and positioned in the hangar for \npotential shipment. The vehicle [at Dryden] has been covered \nwith plastic to keep the open avionics compartments from get\xad\nting contaminated. If the vehicle is not shipped, a considerable \namount of work needs to be accomplished.19\nThe April 16, 2001, report added, “MSFC [NASA Marshall Space Flight \nCenter] stated that the X-34 vehicles will belong to the government on April\xa020. \nAlso, Orbital had offered to store vehicles A-2 and A-3 at their Dulles facility at \nno cost to the government.”20 The May 29 report noted that Dryden was still \nlooking at storing the X-34 assets in the Edwards area, either at North Base or \nthe Air Force Museum on base.21 The June 4 report added that the Air Force \nMuseum at Edwards AFB had offered to take the A-1A vehicle and display \nit in an indoor environment. The report also stated that NASA Marshall was \nwithdrawing X-34 funds from NASA Dryden.22 The July 2 report added that \nthere was still no disposition decision on the now Government-owned assets.23 \nFinally, the August 2 report noted that the Air Force X-34 Flight Test Support \nfunction had been closed out on July 31, and that there would be no further \nX-34 sections in the Aerospace Projects reports.24\nDescent into Bickering: NASA and Orbital Trade Fire\nLike a once-promising relationship gone horribly wrong, the two partners in \nthe X-34 program first separated and then launched increasingly furious attacks \non the character and intentions of the other. Following the announcement of \nthe cancellation of the X-34 Project, disagreement over the reason for termi\xad\nnating the project quickly arose between NASA and Orbital, as reflected in a \nMarch 8, 2001, article in The Huntsville Times. J. R. Thompson, president of \nOrbital and a former director of NASA Marshall, was quoted as saying that \nNASA believed that the program was too expensive, yet NASA was the cause \nof the delays and increased costs. “They saddled us with redundant systems \nand review processes that had nothing to do with an unmanned test vehicle….', 'Promise Denied\n318\nThus, his views of X-34 are worth considering. In a March 2001 correspon\xad\ndence to Aviation Week & Space Technology, Burt Rutan commented on NASA’s \ndecision to cancel the X-34 before it could be flown:\nThe X-34s should be flown, not parked. Years behind due to \nproblems with a Government-developed engine and a NASA \nrisk-averse attitude toward flying a single-string flight control \nsystem, the program would still probably fail if left alone. Failure \nis assured by the decision late last month, with no return on the \n$200 million investment. What exists are two nearly complete \nflight articles and data that could have been generated without \nbuilding hardware. Once flown, you have gathered new informa\xad\ntion that you will be able to get from analysis. This is true whether \nthey fly fine and land smooth or make a smoking hole in the \ndesert. Send the X-34s to Mojave, I’ll fly them.55 \nBurt Rutan had it exactly right. There was nothing gained and much lost \nby failure to carry through with flight-testing of the robotically piloted X-34 \nTechnology Demonstrator vehicles that were already built and ready for flight-\ntesting. It should be noted that this viewpoint represents the near unanimous \nopinion of the NASA and Orbital engineers and officials interviewed in con\xad\nnection with the writing of this book. As already noted, however, funds to \ncomplete both the X-33 and X-34 were not forthcoming in the Space Launch \nInitiative, which was the follow-on program to the single-stage-to-orbit and \nreusable launch vehicle program. It is interesting to note that the NASA media \nrelease that announced the start of the Space Launch Initiative and the end of \nthe X-33 and X-34 projects stated with the same degree of optimism as had \nbeen presented when the DC-XA, X-33, and X-34 programs were started.56\nSix years after the retirement of the Space Shuttle, 16 years after the start \nof the Space Launch Initiative, and 21 years after the start of the single-stage-\nto-orbit reusable launch vehicle program, payloads were still launched to low-\nEarth orbit by expendable rockets, and American astronauts were still flown to \nthe International Space Station in Russian spacecraft. Failure to carry through \nwith the X-34 program truly represented a promise denied.', 'Promise Denied\n314\nbudget overruns, and the declining degree of interest in the program that, in \nturn, necessitated requesting additional funds that led to termination of the \nproject. These factors can be posed as a series of questions.\nWas NASA Ever Fully Committed to the Second X-34 Program? \nNASA expressed disappointment in Orbital’s and Rockwell’s inability to con\xad\ntinue the first X-34 program, which was planned to include a follow-on com\xad\nmercial vehicle that could potentially replace the Space Shuttle and reach the \nInternational Space Station. Was this what NASA really wanted, rather than \nsimply a moderate hypersonic transatmospheric technology demonstrator? \nNASA’s own OIG report noted that there was a lack of consensus within the \nAgency regarding the future plans for space transportation. NASA was basically \ndirected to restart the program by the White House. Also, NASA appeared to \nbe on the verge of terminating the second X-34 program in late 1998 or early \n1999 until Congress exerted pressure to continue the program. \nIn addition, as noted in congressional correspondence reviewed in chap\xad\nter\xa09, NASA, as early as September 1998, was considering not requesting fund\xad\ning for the RLV program as part of the Agency’s fiscal year 2000 budget request. \nLikewise, during the fall of 1999, NASA was already laying the groundwork \nfor the follow-on Space Launch Imitative through an effort known as the \nIntegrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP). This planning project, which also \nwas reviewed in chapter 9, was taking place at the same time that NASA was \nplanning for the restructuring of the X-34 project, an effort that raised the cost \nto a level that would have required funding through the SLI program. Finally, \naccording to feedback received by Orbital from an engineer familiar with the \nSLI review team effort, NASA rejected the team’s initial recommendation to \nfund the X-34 project as part of the SLI program. \nWas the Right Engine Baselined for the X-34? \nNASA merged two separate programs that each could have been successful \non its own, but experienced problems when combined. NASA Marshall, by \nmost accounts, accomplished major goals in the development of the Fastrac \nengine and in training a new generation of propulsion engineers. The extent \nof this accomplishment, as well as the interest and dedication of the engineers \nand technicians who worked on the Fastrac/MC-1 engine, is evident in the \nextensive Project Closeout Termination Report that they prepared, as well as \nin the engines that existed upon termination of the X-34 project. Likewise, \nOrbital successfully fabricated two flight-ready X-34 vehicles with a core of \nengineers and technicians who for the most part remained with Orbital and \nused the experience they gained from the X-34 program/project to build \nOrbital Sciences Corporation into a major aerospace company.

This effort, known as the Integrated Space Transportation Plan \n(ISTP), subsequently formed the basis for NASA’s Space Launch Initiative. \nThe ISTP consisted of several Space Transportation Architecture Studies \n(STAS I, II, and III) that “identified requirements, developed candidate archi\xad\ntectures, and identified sets of technologies to enable those architectures.”57 The \nISTP studies were undertaken as a partnership between NASA and industry to \nidentify architectures—including new designs and shuttle-derived concepts—\nfor second-generation reusable launch vehicles that were planned to reach \nfirst operational capability in 2010. The goal set for the second-generation \nprogram was “placing payloads in low Earth orbit (LEO) at a cost of $1,000/\nlbm [pounds-mass], and a safety goal of 1/10,000 probability of loss of crew.”58 \nThe second-generation program, however, was not to identify or select any \nspecific launch system. Architecture development would be the responsibility \nof prospective bidders planned for a 2005 competition.59 \nThe next program phase was planned to be the third-generation RLV, \nwhich was scheduled to become operational by 2025. The third-generation \nRLV launch system would call for delivering “payloads to LEO at $100/lbm \nand approach airline-like reliability and safety, with a 1/10\n6 probability of loss \nof crew.” The third-generation was to involve significant effort “to develop \nadvanced on-orbit capabilities and conduct research into more exotic ‘fourth-\ngeneration’ technologies.”60\nThe SLI program also sought to provide a near-term alternative to the Space \nShuttle for providing payload delivery to the International Space Station (ISS). \nThe alternative effort was to focus on “smaller payload classes than Shuttle,']","
SpaceRef made several observations and recommendations regarding the SLI funding issue in their ""Space Access Update"" on August 27. They suggested that X-34 should be completed and flown, but NASA should immediately fund OSC in acquiring the Russian engine they wanted as insurance against further Fastrac problems. NASA should also back off the 'no conspicuous failure is acceptable' position, as it is an experimental vehicle project with three copies of the vehicle, and a reasonable level of risk of damage to or loss of one of the vehicles is a good tradeoff for lower cost and quicker results. SpaceRef also questioned NASA's way of doing business under the proposed SLI follow-on program and recommended that SLI should be split into NASA-specific and U.S. commercial support projects, with a solid firewall between the commercial support project and the influence by the major NASA launch consumer centers.

Regarding the 'no conspicuous failure is acceptable' position for the X-34 project, SpaceRef argued that it was an unreasonable and unaffordable stance, given the experimental nature of the project. They suggested that a reasonable level of risk of damage to or loss of one of the vehicles was a good tradeoff for lower cost and quicker results."
"How might giant impacts on Earth serve as a means to transfer life between planets, as suggested by Sleep and Zahnle in 1998?","In 1998, Sleep and Zahnle proposed that giant impacts on Earth could serve as a means to transfer life between planets. This idea was not new, as Walter Alvarez and Harold Urey had previously suggested that catastrophic events, such as comet impacts, could have caused mass extinctions. However, Sleep and Zahnle's proposal was based on the observation that huge impacts on Earth would inevitably blast rocks containing microscopic life into space, some of which would just as inevitably wind up crashing onto Venus, Mars, Earth's Moon, etc.—and some of these rocks would eventually return to Earth. Rocks returning to Earth could serve as a space-based ""refugia"" for life and reseed Earth after a sterilizing impact. Conversely, giant impacts could also serve as a means to transfer life between planets. Life on Earth might have originated on Mars and then been seeded here by a giant impact. This possibility might make it difficult to distinguish Martian life (should there be any, perhaps in subsurface refuges) from terrestrial life, as we might actually have the same common ancestor.","['A History of Near-Earth Objects Research\n102\nthe “minimal ocean-vaporizing impact,” as they phrased it, and even longer \nfor a larger impact.65 Nothing would likely survive this.\nThe impact of an object 190 kilometers or so in diameter would be suf\xad\nficient to boil the top 200 meters of the oceans away (the photic zone, the \nmaximum depth to which enough sunlight reaches for photosynthesis to \ntake place).

In effect, giant impacts could serve as reset but\xad\ntons.

Shaler contended \nthat “the fall of a bolide of even ten miles in diameter would have been suf\xad\nficient to destroy organic life of the earth.”5 As early as 1916, and continuing \nsporadically through his career, the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik explored \nimpact energies and their effects through modeling.

Giant impacts on Earth could serve as a means to transfer life between planets by blasting rocks containing microscopic life into space, some of which would eventually wind up crashing onto Venus, Mars, Earth’s Moon, etc. These rocks could then return to Earth, serving as a space-based “refugia” for life and reseeding Earth after a sterilizing impact. Additionally, many astrobiologists believed Mars was habitable before Earth had cooled enough to become habitable, meaning that life on Earth might have originated on Mars and then been seeded here by a giant impact. This possibility might make it difficult to distinguish Martian life (should there be any, perhaps in subsurface refuges) from terrestrial life, as we might actually have the same common ancestor."
"How do fins contribute to damping in a helicopter, particularly in rapid forward flight?","In rapid forward flight, fins immediately suggest themselves as an effective substitute for the lateral dihedral in providing damping. In hovering flight and vertical ascent or descent, however, fins would be almost useless. For instance, if we imagine the coaxial screw helicopter in vertical ascent, with a horizontally disposed stabilizer, to pitch slightly, the horizontal stabilizer would be scarcely affected by the slight pitch. Similar considerations would apply in regard to vertical fins used as a substitute for lateral dihedral. In all probability, if dihedrals between the lifting screws are not present, reliance will be placed on skilled actuation of the controls.

Dihedrals in the \nhelicopter, just as in the \nairplane, give static right\xad\ning moments, but damp\xad\ning will also be present, \neven if no dihedral is \nembodied in the design. \nIf a helicopter is rolling in \nsuch fashion that one air\xad\nscrew rises, it can be seen \nfrom the curves of Fig.\xa0 8 \nthat its thrust diminishes; \nsimultaneously the thrust \nof the other airscrew will \nincrease. \nThere \nshould \nbe, therefore, damping in \neither roll or pitch for both \nthree-screw and two-screw \nhelicopters. It is a question, \nhowever, whether a two-\nscrew coaxial helicopter \nwould provide\xa0damping.\nFins to Give Equivalent of the Dihedral. Since it is advisable to keep the number \nof lifting screws down to a minimum, the possibility of using fins immediately sug\xad\ngests itself. In rapid forward flight the use of fins should be effective; if two coaxial \nscrews are employed, one vertical fin placed high above the center of gravity, with \nits plane parallel to the line of flight, would be an effective substitute for the lateral \ndihedral. A stabilizer placed at a negative dihedral to the plane of rotation of the \nlifting screws might be an equally good substitute for the longitudinal dihedral. \nThese auxiliary surfaces in rapid forward flight would not have to be of unduly \nlarge proportions.\nBut in hovering flight and vertical ascent or descent such auxiliary surfaces \nwould be almost useless. For instance, if we imagine the coaxial screw helicop\xad\nter in vertical ascent, with a horizontally disposed stabilizer, to pitch slightly, the Figure 17.

Diagrammatic drawing of the Karman captive helicopter with \nthree rotary engines.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n514\nhorizontal stabilizer would be scarcely affected by the slight pitch. Similar consider\xad\nations would apply in regard to vertical fins used as a substitute for lateral dihedral. \nIn vertical ascent or descent the problem is somewhat easier than for hovering, but \neven if placed in the slipstream the auxiliary surfaces would have to be enormous to \nbe effective. In all probability, if dihedrals between the lifting screws are not pres\xad\nent, reliance will be placed on skilled actuation of the controls.\nDirectional Stability. So-called “directional stability,” more properly “weathercock \nstability[,]” has to be considered for the helicopter just as for the airplane. In the \nairplane weathercock stability is readily secured by a preponderance of fin area aft \nof the center of gravity. Propellers, whether propulsive or airplane propellers or lift\xad\ning airscrews, may be considered as fins. In rapid forward flight the fin action of \nthe propellers, whether two or four lifting screws were used, would be concentrated \napproximately at the center of gravity, and comparatively little power would be \nrequired of a vertically disposed fin to obtain “weathercock stability.” In hovering \nand vertical ascent or descent it would act far less powerfully, and reliance would \nprobably have to be placed on auxiliary steering propellers, and manual control.\nStability a Subject for Research. The above treatment of stability is obviously \nsuperficial. It seems to the author that prior to the building of full-sized helicop\xad\nters a great deal of theoretical analysis and wind-tunnel experimentation should \nbe undertaken as regards stability. It seems ridiculous to expose helicopter pilots \nto great hazards in their first painful efforts, when with some patient wind-tunnel \nwork a machine fairly stable under all conditions might readily be evolved.\nControl. The question of helicopter control is one decided by practical rather than \ntheoretical considerations. There seems no reason, however, why complete control \nunder all circumstances should not be more readily secured than stability. For rapid \nforward flight the requirements are not unlike those of an airplane, and systems of \ncontrol readily suggest themselves. For the ailerons can be substituted variation in \npitch of the lifting airscrews on either side of the longitudinal axis, or else movable \nfins or plates placed in the slipstream of the propellers. In forward flight a vertical \ntail rudder would be just as effective as on the airplane. So would an elevator.\nIn hovering or vertical flight an auxiliary elevator airscrew with variable or \neven reversible pitch would seem to be necessary, as also a steering airscrew—or \nsteering airscrews.\nThe question of control would seem to offer wide scope for inventiveness \nand mechanical skill. Perfectly realizable, helicopter control is always likely to be \nmore complicated and less certain than that of an airplane. A duplicate system of \ncontrols—one for forward flight, one for hovering—might conceivably be neces\xad\nsary. Descriptions of machines which follow illustrate a number of practical forms \nof\xa0control.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n662\nmeans of these components, systematic variations in such parameters as control \npower, damping in roll, yaw and pitch, stick force gradient and stabilization about \neach axis can be evaluated singly or in combination. The results confirm earlier \nwork showing that improvements in handling qualities result with increases in \ndamping. Also there is a large range of damping values within which desirable con\xad\ntrol powers are independent of the damping. However, as the damping is increased, \nthe allowable maximum control power tends to increase.\nA device that supplies signals to the pilot’s instruments to indicate helicopter \nposition and rate of change of position with respect to a ground reference, as well \nas helicopter altitude over the ground, has been constructed. The purpose of the \ndevice is to permit hovering on instruments so that handling qualities in hovering \nmay be investigated. An additional device is also being constructed which will pro\xad\nvide position and rate signals to the pilot in the form of stick forces.\nCurrent efforts to assist in modernization of military flying qualities specifica\xad\ntions for helicopters serve to emphasize both the value of the damping and control-\npower work completed and the need for more information; for example, how to \napply the results established for helicopters of typical size to size extremes which \ncan range from 250 to 100,000 pounds gross weight. As one step in learning pos\xad\nsible effects of size, and also the effects of gross changes in the ratio of rotor inertia \nto aircraft inertia, brief tests have recently been completed with a tip-jet-driven \nhelicopter of far smaller size but of higher relative rotor inertia than any previously \ntested. Certain beneficial effects related to high rotor inertia were readily apparent \nand led to additional comparative tests with more typical designs. Correlation of \nthese results with those obtained with other larger helicopters is continuing.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n640\nThe results of flight tests made by the Navy of a tandem-rotor helicopter rep\xad\nresentative of a present helicopter design indicated that it was directionally unstable \nat small angles of yaw. To study and find means for increasing the directional \nstability of this helicopter, force tests have been made in the Langley free-flight \ntunnel on a model of a fuselage-pylon combination which was representive [sic] of \nthe tandem-rotor configuration. The investigation included force tests of the model \nwith the original tail and with various modifications to the tail.\nAn aerodynamic servo-controlled rotor system in which auxiliary airfoils \nmounted outboard on the blades are used to twist the blades in order to achieve \npitch control has been investigated on the Langley helicopter tower. The results, \npublished in Technical Note 2086, indicated that satisfactory performance and \ncontrol characteristics could be obtained by using the aerodynamic type of servo-\ncontrol, although approximately 6.5 percent more hovering power was required as \ncompared with a conventional rotor of the same diameter and solidity.\nVIBRATION\nA theoretical analysis of the frequency and damping characteristics of the free \nmodes of vibration of balanced, fixed-ended, and hinged elastic rotor blades in hov\xad\nering and in vertical flight has been made by the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn \nunder NACA sponsorship. This study, presented in Technical Note 1999, is further \ndiscussed under the section on the Subcommittee on Vibration and Flutter.\nThe frequency and damping characteristics of the coupled flapping and lag\xad\nging oscillations of helicopter blades in hovering have also been derived for the \ngeneral case in which the lagging (vertical) hinge axis is offset from the flapping \nhinge axis, while both hinge axes are inclined. The analysis and the numerical \nexamples indicate that significant increases in the damping of the lagging motions, \nwhich ordinarily border on instability, can be obtained by suitable inclinations of \nthe hinge axes, especially of the lagging axis. Offsetting the flapping and lagging \nhinge axes tends especially to increase the natural lagging frequency.\nRESEARCH EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUE\nA suitable hot-wire anemometer was devised and installed in a helicopter where \nit has been in use for 1 year. This instrument indicates the forward component of \nairspeed, whether positive or negative, and is particularly suitable for the very low \nairspeeds which are encountered near hovering.', '665\nDocument 5-44 (a–b)\nLongitudinal Stability in Forward Flight: During the course of the perfor\xad\nmance tests, considerable flying was done at relatively high speeds, approaching the \nlimits imposed by blade stalling. It was found quite difficult to hold steady condi\xad\ntions because of a strong tendency of the machine to diverge in pitch, creating the \nimpression of balancing on a ball. This characteristic seemed far more pronounced \nwith some of the rotors tested than with others, but was always troublesome. Upward \npitching was most troublesome as it frequently precipitated or intensified stalling, \nwhich added to the difficulties because it increased the tendency to pitch up and \nwas accompanied by rather violent periodic stick forces and vibration. The forward \ndisplacement of the control from trim necessary to check some of these pitching \nmotions suggested that a short delay in applying corrective control would allow a \nmaneuver severe enough that control would be lost. Although there seemed ample \ncontrol to stop downward pitching, an uncomfortable amount of forward control \nwas again required in order to check the subsequent upward pitching. These char\xad\nacteristics suggested a pronounced type of instability.\nThe tendency to depart from the trim speed and the necessity of applying \nappreciable control deflection against a pitching maneuver involving acceleration, \ninitiated either by control or by external disturbances, is apparent throughout the \nspeed range normally used in forward flight. It becomes much less pronounced, \nhowever, at the lower speeds.\nShortly after the embryo pilot experiences forward flight, he is impressed with \nthe necessity for having to constantly fly the helicopter. At first thought the reasons \nfor this situation are not clear. It is common knowledge that a flapping rotor tilts \nto the rear if speed is increased, thus tending to cause the machine to return to \nthe original speed. This condition constitutes stability of the rotor with respect to \nspeed. Wind-tunnel tests of the R-4 fuselage have shown it to be unstable, but this \ninstability is evidently outweighed by the rotor stability just discussed, inasmuch \nas measurements of stick position have shown that the stick does move forward to \ntrim at increasing steady speeds. Furthermore, observation and measurements have \nindicated that the static stick-force gradient with respect to speed is small, but has \nbeen either unstable, neutral, or stable, depending upon the pitching moments of \nthe particular blades and upon the bungee configuration, without greatly altering \nthe pilot’s overall impression of instability. The source of the difficulty, therefore, \ncannot be either stick-fixed or stick-free instability with speed.\nThe somewhat obvious conclusion is that the pilot’s impressions are a result \nof the helicopter’s instability with angle of attack. There are at least two logical \nsources for its instability with angle of attack. The first results from the flapping \nof the rotor. If the helicopter rotor is subjected to an angle-of-attack change in \nforward flight, then for constant rpm the advancing blades are subjected to a \ngreater upward accelerating force than the retreating blades because the product of \nangle-of-attack change and velocity squared is greater on the advancing side. The \nresulting flapping motion will then tilt the disk in the direction of the tip-speed']","
Fins can contribute to damping in a helicopter, particularly in rapid forward flight, by acting as a substitute for dihedral. If two coaxial screws are employed, one vertical fin placed high above the center of gravity, with its plane parallel to the line of flight, would be an effective substitute for the lateral dihedral. A stabilizer placed at a negative dihedral to the plane of rotation of the lifting screws might be an equally good substitute for the longitudinal dihedral. These auxiliary surfaces in rapid forward flight would not have to be of unduly large proportions. However, in hovering flight and vertical ascent or descent, such auxiliary surfaces would be almost useless."
"What are the recent and ongoing missions exploring Mars, and what are their primary objectives?","As of this writing, NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Indian Space Research Organization have an array of missions operating at Mars. These include Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN), and the Mars Orbiter Mission. The primary objectives of these missions include scientific exploration, sample return, and human missions. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, for example, is designed to study in depth the ""inner space"" of Mars: its crust, mantle, and core. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN) is explicitly undertaking investigations of the planet’s upper atmosphere and space environment to ascertain what might have happened to Mars’s atmosphere and climate over its history. The Mars Orbiter Mission, on the other hand, is focused on understanding the geological history of Mars. These missions enable scientists to acquire ""ground truth,"" measurements so necessary to fully interpret data from orbital missions. The successful landings of the 1-metric-ton Curiosity rover on Mars and the Rosetta mission’s Philae probe on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko clearly show the ability of our space agencies to explore our solar system at a new level of intensity. Steps like these will allow humans to go beyond this planet and out into the solar system once again.","['Chapter 7:\u2002 Exploring the Cosmos\n127\nNo less significant, in August 2012, NASA landed Curiosity, the Mars \nScience Laboratory, on Mars. Since landing, Curiosity has made some stunning \ndiscoveries. For example, in measuring radiation levels on the surface of the Red \nPlanet, it has found that Martian radiation levels are comparable to those expe\xad\nrienced by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. This enhances \nthe possibility that human activities on the surface are possible. Additionally, \nCuriosity has found beyond any real doubt that there is an ancient streambed \nwhere water once flowed roughly knee-deep for thousands of years at a time. In \ndrilling into the soil, Curiosity also spotted some of the key chemical ingredi\xad\nents for life. \nFollow-on missions have been conducted since that time.

MPL’s primary goal was to \ndeploy a lander and two penetrators (known as \nDeep Space 2) on the surface of Mars to extend \nour knowledge on the planet’s past and present \nwater resources. The objective was to explore the \nnever-before studied carbon dioxide ice cap, about \n1,000 kilometers from the south pole. The mis\xad\nsion also called for recording local meteorological \nconditions, analyzing samples of polar deposits, \nand taking multi-spectral images of local areas. \nMPL was to have performed its mission simul\xad\ntaneously with that of the Mars Climate Orbiter \nthat would have acted as a communications relay \nduring its surface operations. MPL itself com\xad\nprised a bus section (for power, propulsion, and \ncommunications during the outbound voyage) and \na 290-kilogram lander that stood 1.06 meters tall \non the ground. The lander was equipped with a \n2-meter long remote arm to dig into the terrain and \ninvestigate the properties of Martian soil (using \nthe Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer). Having \narrived at Mars on 3 December 1999, the space\xad\ncraft would enter the atmosphere, and about 10 \nminutes prior to landing, would jettison its cruise \nstage and solar panels and then release the two \n3.572 kilogram (each) Deep Space 2 microprobes. \nUnlike Mars Pathfinder, MPL was scheduled \nto make a completely controlled landing using \nretro-rockets all the way to the surface. Landing \nwas scheduled for 21:03 UT on 3 December 1999 \nwith two-way communications planned to begin 20 \nminutes later. The two Deep Space 2 microprobes \n(renamed Amundsen and Scott on 15 November \n1999), meanwhile, would impact the ground at a \nspeed of 200 meters/second about 50–85 seconds \nprior to the lander and about 100 kilometers away. \nEach penetrator was designed to obtain a small \nsample of subsurface soil using an electric drill for \nanalysis. The microprobes’ mission was expected \nto last about 36 hours while the lander mission \nwould continue until 1 March 2000.

The \nparticles were expected to consist of a mixture of the ancient, pre-solar interstellar grains \nand nebular condensates that were frozen into comets at the far edges of the solar nebula \nduring the formation of the solar system. Mission success hinged on that objective.\nSecondary science objectives were to take 65 images of the comet’s nucleus within \n2,000 kilometers; to image the coma; to analyze particles in situ within the coma; \nand to collect and return 100 small, high-velocity, “new” interstellar particles from \na stream of “fresh” interstellar grains discovered entering the solar system from the \nsame direction as interstellar gas.81\nTertiary objectives—not critical but considered important by the team—were to \nmeasure certain aspects of the comet as the spacecraft flew through its coma. These \naspects included the coma dust flux, particle size distribution, integrated dust fluence, \nlarge particle momentum, and dust flux profiles over the spacecraft’s path. Another \ntertiary objective was to collect coma volatiles and perform in situ compositional \nanalyses of interplanetary dust particles, interstellar particles, and any other particle \ntypes encountered during the cometary flyby. To accomplish all this, the Stardust mis\xad\nsion was outfitted with a sample collector, a mass spectrometer, a dust detector, and a \nshared engineering optical navigation camera.82\nThe choice of comet, like all comet missions, was limited by those traveling through \nthe inner solar system at the projected time of encounter.

The LO2 \ndump line is supported by one fore-aft sliding bracket.49\nRP-1 Feed, Fill, and Dump Subsystem. AVICA, a Meggitt Aerospace \nCompany, was selected to manufacture the fill, feed, vent, and dump lines for \nthe Fastrac engine. These lines were made of 625 Inconel and ranged in wall \nthickness from 0.049 to 0.083 inches. All of the main propulsion system fill, \nfeed, vent, and dump lines used lightweight, low-profile AS1895 flanges, which \nalso are used in commercial and fighter aircraft.50\nThe lines performed the functions of filling the LOX and RP-1 tanks, pro\xad\nviding the proper inlet conditions for the main engine, venting the tanks to \nprevent an over pressurization, and dumping LOX and RP-1 prior to landing. \nThe RP-1 system used the same trunk line for the feed, fill, and dump functions \ndue to weight and packaging concerns. The aft end of the trunk branched and \nhad one valve for feed and one valve for dump and fill. The aft portion of the \nRP-1 line had to accommodate the vehicle structural deflections and engine \ngimballing while providing propellant flow to the engine. The forward end of \nthe subsystem had two isolation valves—one for feed and one for dump. The \nmain trunk had a pressure compensating elbow at the forward end and four \nbellows along the line at the bulkheads in order to handle the motion of the \nRP-1 tank. The feedline was supported at the bulkheads by a combination of \nsliding and fixed supports. The RP-1 dump subsystem also was used to fill the \ntank, which must be done within a 45-minute time frame. The LOX tanks \nwould have been filled serially with the vent valves open. The feed system \ncontained free bellows, gimbal joints, restrained bellows, articulated bellows, \npin joint, and pressure compensated elbows. These components were used to \naccommodate the gimbaling of the engine and the loads and deflections in \nthe feed system.51', 'The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n331\nWith a common shaft, the arrangement of the elements on the shaft had \nto be determined. [Redacted]\nAt the time of termination of the Fastrac/MC-1 engine project, 7 tur\xad\nbopump assemblies had been built and 5 of the units had been tested. Also, at \nthe time of project termination, two major turbopump assembly improvement \nefforts were in progress. These efforts focused on improving the durability of \nthe interpropellant seal package and the elimination of rotating cavitation in \nthe LO2 inducer.6\nDynamic Seals. A series of seals and vent cavities are located between the \noxidizer and the fuel pump inducer/impellers in order to maintain separation \nbetween the propellants. The labyrinth seal controls overboard leakage from \nthe oxidizer pump during operation. The LO2 seal drain cavity collects LO2 \nflowing from the labyrinth seal and helium flowing from the helium buffer seal \nand drains via an external vent to the atmosphere. The fuel seal drain cavity \ncollects fuel flowing from the bellows seal and helium flowing from the helium \nbuffer seal and drains via a vent to the atmosphere. The turbine end face seal \nlimits RP-1 leakage into the turbine from the fuel pump.7\nCombustion Devices\nThe combustion devices of the Fastrac/MC-1 engine include the main injector, \nnozzle, gas generator, gas generator igniter, and thrust chamber assembly igniter. \nThe thrust chamber assembly consisted of a low-cost injector and single-piece \nchamber/nozzle. \nInjector: The Fastrac injector design consists of only three components—an \ninjector body, a gimbal block, and a faceplate. The costs of the Fastrac injectors \nwere approximately $40,000 each, compared to $330,000 for a similar liquid \noxygen/kerosene type then in use.\nEarly tests of the Fastrac injectors [Redacted] resulted in excessive heating \n(streaking) of the [Redacted] combustion chamber material, but the problem \nwas overcome by using a computational fluid dynamic approach. Combustion \nstability of the injector system also was demonstrated in stability tests where \n100\xa0percent over-pressure spike, induced by a pyrotechnic charge, damped \nin the appropriate time. The thrust chamber assembly, which includes the \ninjector and chamber/nozzle also “serves as the engine skeleton since the tur\xad\nbopump, gas generator, and turbine exhaust duct are all mounted directly to \nthe chamber/nozzle. As a result, a test-verified model of the thrust chamber/\nnozzle component is integral to performing the dynamic loads calculation for \nthe engine system…. The chamber/nozzle (referred to as the nozzle) is com\xad\nposed of two main composite layers and several metallic and over-bands…and \nweighs approximately 528 lb.”8', '329\nAPPENDIX 2\nThe Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and \nX-34 Main Propulsion System\nThis Appendix reviews a number of components and subsystems of the Fastrac/\nMC-1 engine and the X-34 vehicle’s main propulsion system (MPS), as well \nas a number of lessons learned from the project work. In commenting on the \nchanges that had occurred in the development practices for hardware com\xad\nponents and subsystems, Michael D. Shadoan and David L. Sparks from the \nSpace Transportation Directorate at NASA Marshall wrote that\nDevelopment of space hardware has traditionally been done \nwith the philosophy that the designer must use all available \ntechnological resources to maximize performance. This philoso\xad\nphy placed great emphasis on high thrust to weight ratios that \ngreatly increased the cost and complexity of space hardware. \nHowever, in recent years of budget reductions and downsizing, \nthe Government as a whole has been tasked with reinventing \nitself, to adopt an FBC [faster, better, cheaper] attitude when \ndevising and developing new program acquisitions. Applying \nthis to the design of space hardware means we must adopt new \npractices that result in inexpensive and reliable components. To \naccomplish these goals, the designer must incorporate fabrication \nexperience, such as material and process selection, along with \ninnovative design approaches.1\nFastrac (MC-1) Engine Components and Subsystems\nOverview\nThe NASA Fastrac/MC-1 engine primary components and subsystems were \nsimple in design and construction and were designed to require minimal \nmaintenance in satisfying operational requirements. “Each subsystem is \nsegregated to avoid complexity and maximize safety and simplifies trouble', 'The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n333\nThe MC-1 engine main injector contains a manifold for each of \nthe engine liquid propellants that force the propellants to flow \nthrough a series of concentric channels between the injector core \nand copper faceplate. The propellants then flow through a pattern \nof injection holes in the faceplate causing them to mix together \nin the combustion chamber. The injector lies in the primary load \npath of the engine. It provides part of the backbone that many \nof the other engine components mate to and must carry all the \nengine thrust load as well as much of the dynamic loads generated \nby the engine and flight environment.12\nThe entire injector component—excluding the gimbal assembly—consisted \nof the core, LOX dome cap, and faceplate. As noted by Michael Shadoan and \nDavid Sparks: \nIn order to achieve the value goals established by the FBC [faster, \nbetter, cheaper] policy, a review of traditional design practices \nwas necessary. This internal reevaluation would ultimately chal\xad\nlenge more conventional methods of material selection, design \nprocess, and fabrication techniques. The effort was highly suc\xad\ncessful. This “new way” of thinking has resulted in an innovative \ninjector design, one with reduced complexity and significantly \nlower cost. Application of lessons learned during this effort to new \nor existing designs can have a similar effect on costs and future \nprogram successes.\nThe two NASA engineers added that the initial goal was to build a LO2/RP-1 \ninjector that exhibits good performance and wall compatibility when operated \nwith an ablative thrust chamber and nozzle assembly at a fraction of the cost \nof a conventional equivalent unit. The development injector was designed, \nfabricated, and tested in 16 months. The design was then transformed, with \nminor modifications, into the main injector for the Fastrac engine.13\nThe main injector was first hot-fire tested on July 25, 1997, and subse\xad\nquently underwent at least 39 tests at the component level and 40 tests at \nthe engine level. By July 2000, it had accumulated a total of 36 starts and \n1,246 operating seconds on nozzle component tests, and a total of 42 starts \nand 857 seconds on nozzle engine tests.14  The component testing included \nperformance, stability, and thermal evaluations of the thrust chamber assembly \nduring hot fire. The engine level testing was done at both the Horizontal Test \nFacility and at the B2 test stand at NASA Stennis. In November 1999 the test\xad\ning was moved from Stennis to Rocketdyne’s Alpha 1 position at their Santa', 'The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n343\nof the 10 supplemental advanced technology experiments originally planned \nfor the powered flight-testing portion of the X-34 program. It represented the \nlargest composite oxygen tank made and would have been the first to fly on a \nlaunch vehicle. The composite tank represented a significant step in lowering \nthe vehicle weight and obtaining the desired cost reduction from $10,000 \nper pound to $1,000 per pound. Two LOX fuel tanks were being assembled \nand tested at NASA Marshall under a 50/50 cooperative agreement between \nMarshall and Lockheed Martin Michoud Space Systems. The first tank, which \nwas in the assembly process, was planned for use in ground tests. The second \nfollow-on tank, which also was designed by Lockheed Martin, was planned \nfor use on the flight tests. The curing process called for heating the composite \ncylinder in an autoclave at 350°F for approximately 4 hours at a pressure of \n92 pounds per square inch. The cylinder consisted of between 18 and 80 plies \nthat were saturated with epoxy resin, which hardens in the autoclave.42\nThe major components of the of the LOX fuel tanks were the main barrel \nsection, two domed end pieces, and internal domes designed to prevent oxygen \nfrom shifting in flight and altering the flight characteristics of the vehicle. The \ntwo primary obstacles that needed to be overcome were: a) composites nor\xad\nmally become brittle and crack when exposed to liquid oxygen at minus 320°F; \nand b) oxygen molecules are very small making it difficult to keep them from \nleaking through the threads that comprise the composite layers.43\nPropellant Feed (LOX and RP-1) Subsystems. The LOX and RP-1 feed \nsubsystems were designed to transfer propellants from the tanks to the engine \nwith the X-34 in either the horizontal or vertical position. The engine has a \ngimbal requirement of +10/–8 degrees in pitch and ±3 degrees in yaw. This \nmotion, combined with movement of the thrust structure and the engine \nunder thrust, along with the translation of the aft LOX tank dome due to \ncryogenic shrinkage, added significant design requirements to the feed system. \nThe developed LOX feed subsystem was a 4.5-inch Inconel tube with two dual \naxis gimbals, a z-axis pinned gimbal, and a pressure compensating elbow. The \nLOX tank required a sump to minimize the flow losses by turning the flow \n90 degrees to avoid the engine thrust mount. The pre-valves used in the LOX \nsubsystem were 4-inch pneumatic ball valves designed by Ketema. The same \npre-valve was used in the RP-1 system. Due to geometric considerations, the \nvalve had two actuator configurations.44\nDue to weight and packaging concerns, the RP-1 system used the same \ntrunk line for the feed, fill, and dump functions. The aft portion of the trunk \nline divided and had one valve for feed and one for dump and fill. The gim\xad\nballing section of the RP-1 feed line consisted of a 4-inch Inconel tube. The \nRP-1 dump system also was used to fill the RP tank and had to be able to \nsupport filling in less than 45 minutes and dumping within the 300-second']","
The LO2 Fill and Dump subsystem in the Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System provides for the transfer of liquid oxygen (LO2) propellants overboard when the vehicle is in a roughly horizontal orientation during flight and provides a means of filling the tanks during ground operations. The line must provide sufficient flow for filling the LO2 tanks in no greater than 60 minutes and dumping within the required 300 second trajectory window. This line exits the aft LO2 tank aft manhole cover, is routed down the starboard side of the vehicle, and exits through the aft bulkhead. The fill dump line is a 4” Inconel tube with a universal bellows, a flow-meter, the same 4” Ketema control valve, and has a quick disconnect GSE fitting 4” outside of the aft bulkhead. The LO2 dump line is supported by one fore-aft sliding bracket."

In a subsequent letter to his son, the senior Burney sug\xad\ngested the Greek word “aster” to denote “starlike,” and his son suggested that \n“oid” be added to form “asteroid.” Herschel first used the term on 6\xa0May 1802 \nin his memoir presented to the Royal Society entitled “Observations of the \nTwo Lately Discovered Celestial Bodies,” but his choice was not immediately \ngreeted with great enthusiasm. Indeed, Herschel was accused of applying a \nlesser designation for these objects so as not to detract from his own discovery \nof the planet Uranus in 1781, and the English author John Corry even accused \nHershel of “philosophical quackery.” Giuseppe Piazzi himself also rejected the \nterm “asteroid,” perhaps because his pride would not allow his discovery to be \nknown as anything other than a primary planet. Even so, by 1830, the term \n“asteroid” was commonly used in England, and the American astronomer \nBenjamin Apthorp Gould, founder of the Astronomical Journal in 1849, gave \nthe term his stamp of approval in 1848.2 By the second half of the 19th cen\xad\ntury, the term “minor planet” was often used instead of “asteroid.” Currently, \nthe International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the Minor Planet Center \n(MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, use the term “minor planet,” but the \ntwo terms are interchangeable, and both are widely used.\nBy July 1851, there were only 15 discovered asteroids, few enough that \nthey were usually listed along with the then-known planets. Fourteen of \nthese asteroids had assigned symbols, but these symbols, meant to be shortcut \ndesignations, were getting complicated and difficult to draw. For example, \n1.\t\nClifford J.

Upon discovery, both asteroids and comets are first given provisional designations, which are temporary. For asteroids, the provisional designation consists of the discovery year and an alphanumeric code providing the discovery year, half month, and order of discovery within the half month. For example, 1992 AB is the second (B) asteroid discovered in the first half of January (A) 1992. 

For comets, the provisional designation consists of a leading “P” or “C” with the discovery year and half-month capital letter followed by the numerical order of the discovery during that half month. For example, C/2015 A2 (Pan-STARRS) was the second comet discovery announcement made during the first half of January 2015.

Once the orbits of asteroids and comets become secure, they can receive permanent numbers and names. For asteroids, a number is normally assigned in sequential order when its orbit is secure, and it is then eligible for naming, usually by the discoverer(s). For example, 8373 Stephengould = 1992 AB was named after Harvard scientist Stephen Jay Gould by the discoverers Gene and Carolyn Shoemaker.

For comets, they are normally named after the discoverer(s) or discovery program. Short periodic comets are numbered sequentially after they have been recovered or observed at a second perihelion passage. For example, 1P/Halley was the first short periodic comet recognized as such by Edmond Halley. This comet’s return in 1682 is designated 1P/1682 Q1 since it was the first comet seen in the second half of August of that year."
"Question: What was the primary goal of the Mariner C spacecraft and what was the outcome of the launch of Mariner III, the first of the two probes?","The primary goal of the Mariner C spacecraft was to conduct a radio-occultation experiment to determine atmospheric properties of Venus. The outcome of the launch of Mariner III, the first of the two probes, was a failure due to a malfunction in the pitch guidance module, which led to loss of pitch control at an altitude of 148 kilometers at T+4.7 minutes. As a result, the stack began tumbling and the Centaur upper stage engines shut down. The problem was traced to a failed integrated circuit in the pitch guidance module. 

However, the Mariner VI and VII spacecraft, launched in February and March 1969, respectively, were successful in their mission to study the surface and atmosphere of Mars during close flybys. Both spacecraft were intended to study the surface and atmosphere of Mars during close flybys (approximately 3,200 kilometers) that would include a radio-occultation experiment. All onboard instrumentation was designed to collect data on Mars; there were no experiments for study of interplanetary space. The failure of Mariner III did not significantly impact the success of the Mariner VI and VII missions.","['70\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016\n83\nMariner V\nNation: USA (36)\nObjective(s): Venus flyby\nSpacecraft: Mariner-67E / Mariner-E\nSpacecraft Mass: 244.9 kg\nMission Design and Management: NASA / JPL\nLaunch Vehicle: Atlas Agena D (Atlas Agena D \nno. 23 / Atlas D no. 5401 / Agena D no. \nAD157/6933)\nLaunch Date and Time: 14 June 1967 / 06:01:00 UT\nLaunch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 12\nScientific Instruments:\n1.\t ultraviolet photometer\n2.\t S-band occultation experiment\n3.\t dual frequency occultation experiment\n4.\t solar plasma probe\n5.\t magnetometer\n6.\t trapped radiation detector\n7.\t celestial mechanics experiment\nResults: In December 1965, NASA approved a proj\xad\nect to modify the Mariner IV backup spacecraft \nto conduct a closer flyby of Venus than the only \nother NASA probe to fly past Venus, Mariner II. \nThe primary goal of the mission was to conduct a \nradio-occultation experiment (much like Mariner \nIV at Mars) to determine atmospheric properties \nof Venus. Unlike Mariner IV, however, Mariner \nV did not carry an imaging instrument. Initially, \nNASA had planned to send Mariner V on a flyby at \na miss distance of 8,165 kilometers to the surface, \nbut the Agency altered its plan in favor of a more \nmodest 75,000-kilometer flyby in order to preclude \nthe non-sterilized vehicle from crashing into the \nplanet. After a mid-course correction on 19 June, \nMariner V began transmitting data on Venus on \n19\xa0October during its encounter. Closest approach \nwas at 17:34:56 UT at a range of 4,094 kilome\xad\nters, much closer than expected due to the course \ncorrection. Mariner V found that although Venus \ndoes not have a magnetic field, the dense daylight \nionosphere produces a bow shock that deflects \nthe solar wind around the planet. The ultraviolet \nphotometer detected a hydrogen corona (as found \nby the Soviet Venera 4) but no oxygen emission. \nMariner V’s instruments indicated that the planet’s \nsurface temperature and pressure were 527°C and \n75 to 100 atmospheres, respectively—which coun\xad\ntered the Soviet claim that its Venera 4 spacecraft \nhad managed to transmit from the planet’s surface. \nThe encounter with Venus deflected the spacecraft \ntowards the Sun, and Mariner V entered solar orbit \nwith parameters ranging from 0.579 AU and 0.735 \nAU. On 4 December 1967, NASA lost contact with \nthe spacecraft although controllers briefly regained \ncontact on 14 October 1968. The spacecraft did \nnot transmit any further telemetry and NASA even\xad\ntually stopped attempts (on 5 November 1968) to \ncommunicate with the vehicle, now in heliocentric \norbit. Planetary scientists reviewed data from both \nMariner V and the Soviet Venera 4 at a conference \nat Kitt Peak National Observatory in March 1968, \none of the first major international meetings to dis\xad\ncuss the results of planetary exploration. Scientists \nconcluded that neither Mariner V or Venera 4 had \nbeen entirely successful in communicating data \nabout conditions at the planet’s surface.\n84\nKosmos 167 [Venera]\nNation: USSR (48)\nObjective(s): Venus impact\nSpacecraft: V-67 (1V no. 311)\nSpacecraft Mass: c. 1,100 kg\nMission Design and Management: GSMZ imeni \nLavochkina\nLaunch Vehicle: Molniya-M + Blok VL (8K78M no. \nYa716-71, also Ya15000-71)\nLaunch Date and Time: 17 June 1967 / 02:36:38 UT\nLaunch Site: NIIP-5 / Site 1/5', '99\n1971\n123\nMariner 8\nNation: USA (48)\nObjective(s): Mars orbit\nSpacecraft: Mariner-71H / Mariner-H\nSpacecraft Mass: 997.9 kg\nMission Design and Management: NASA / JPL\nLaunch Vehicle: Atlas Centaur (AC-24 / Atlas 3C \nno. 5405C / Centaur D-1A)\nLaunch Date and Time: 9 May 1971 / 01:11:01 UT\nLaunch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 36A\nScientific Instruments:\n1.\t imaging system\n2.\t ultraviolet spectrometer\n3.\t infrared spectrometer\n4.\t infrared radiometer\nResults: Mariner-71H (also called Mariner-H) was \nthe first of a pair of American spacecraft intended \nto explore the physical and dynamic characteristics \nof Mars from Martian orbit.

The mission proved to \nbe the first fully successful interplanetary mission \nperformed by any nation. After a mid-course correc\xad\ntion on 4 September, the spacecraft flew by Venus \nat a range of 34,854 kilometers at 19:59:28 UT on \n14 December 1962. During a 42-minute scan of \nthe planet, Mariner II gathered significant data on \nthe Venusian atmosphere and surface before con\xad\ntinuing on to heliocentric orbit. The radiometers, \nin particular, were able to conduct five scans of the \nnightside of the planet, eight across the terminator, \nand five on the daylight side. NASA maintained \ncontact until 07:00 UT on 3 January 1963 when \nthe spacecraft was 86.68 million kilometers from \nEarth, a new distance record for a deep space \nprobe. The data returned implied that there was no \nsignificant difference in temperature across Venus: \nreadings from Mariner II’s microwave radiometer \nindicated temperatures of 216°C (on the dark side) \nto 237°C (on the day side). Mariner II also found \nthat there was a dense cloud layer that extended \nfrom 56 to 80 kilometers above the surface. The \nspacecraft detected no discernable planetary mag\xad\nnetic field, partly explained by the great distance \nbetween the spacecraft and the planet.

Both spacecraft \nwere intended to study the surface and atmosphere \nof Mars during close flybys (approximately 3,200 \nkilometers) that would include a radio-occultation \nexperiment. All onboard instrumentation was \ndesigned to collect data on Mars; there were no \nexperiments for study of interplanetary space. The \n3.35-meter tall spacecraft was built around an \neight-sided magnesium framework with four rect\xad\nangular solar panels for 449 W power. The heart \nof the spacecraft was the 11.8-kilogram Control \nComputer and Sequencer (CC&S) computer \nwhich was designed to independently operate \nMariner without intervention from ground control. \nAfter a mid-course correction on 28 February 1969 \nand preliminary imaging sessions (50 photos) on \n28 July Mariner VI flew by Mars at 05:19:07 UT \non 31 July at a distance of 3,429 kilometers.

Mariners 6 and \n7, launched in February and March 1969, each passed Mars about five months \nlater, studying its atmosphere and surface to lay the groundwork for an eventual \nlanding on the planet. Among other discoveries from these probes, they found \nthat much of Mars was cratered almost like the Moon, that volcanoes had once \nbeen active on the planet, that the frost observed seasonally on the poles was \nmade of carbon dioxide, and that huge plates of the Martian crust indicated \nconsiderable tectonic activity. Proposals for additional Mariner probes were also \nconsidered but, because of budgetary considerations, did not fly during the \ndecade. These space probes, as well as others not mentioned here, accumulated \nvolumes of data on the near planets and changed many scientific conceptions \nthat had long held sway.\nWhile these successes were great, all was not rosy with the politics of plane\xad\ntary exploration. In the summer of 1967, even as the technical abilities required \nto conduct an adventurous space science program were being demonstrated, the \nplanetary science community suffered a devastating defeat in Congress and lost \nfunding for a satellite lander to Mars. No other NASA effort but Project Apollo \nwas more exciting than the Mars program in the middle part of the decade. The \nplanet had long held a special attraction to Americans, so much like Earth and \npossibly even sustaining life, and the lander would have allowed for extended \nrobotic exploration of the Red Planet. A projected $2 billion program, the \nlander was to use the Saturn V launch vehicle being developed for Apollo. \nThe problem revolved around the lack of consensus among scientists on \nthe validity of the Mars initiative. Some were excited, but others thought it \nwas too expensive and placed too many hopes on the shoulders of one proj\xad\nect and one project manager. Without that consensus and with other national \npriorities for spending for “Great Society” social programs, combatting urban \nunrest, and supporting the military in Vietnam, the Mars lander was an easy \ntarget in Congress. It was the first space science project ever killed on Capitol \nHill. The NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, frustrated by congressional \naction and infuriated by internal dissension among scientists, ended all work \non planetary\xa0probes.\nThe scientific community learned a hard lesson about the pragmatic, and \nsometimes brutal, politics associated with the execution of “Big Science” under \nthe suzerainty of the federal government. Most important, it realized that strife \nwithin the discipline had to be kept within the discipline to put forward a \nunited front against the priorities of other interest groups and other govern\xad\nment leaders and that it could minimize this public in-fighting through the use \nof the emerging tool of the decadal surveys.

The primary goal of the Mariner C spacecraft was to photograph the Martian surface using a single TV camera fixed on a scan platform that could return up to 22 frames after an eight-month journey. However, during the launch of Mariner III, the first of the two probes, the booster payload shroud failed to separate from the payload. Additionally, battery power spuriously dropped to zero and the spacecraft's solar panels apparently never unfurled to replenish the power supply. Due to the incorrect mass of the spacecraft, it never entered a proper trans-Mars trajectory and ended up in an unanticipated heliocentric orbit of 0.983 × 1.311 AU. A later investigation indicated that the shroud's inner fiberglass layer had separated from the shroud's outer skin, thus preventing jettisoning."
What is the Integrated High Performance Turbine Energy Technology (IHPTET) program and what are its goals?,"The Integrated High Performance Turbine Energy Technology (IHPTET) program was a collaborative effort between the Government and industry to enhance the reliability, durability, and maintainability of military turbine engines while reducing their size, weight, and cost. The program aimed to develop and transfer enabling technologies to industry through the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program (UEET) and other programs. The IHPTET program concluded in 2005, achieving significant progress in several areas, such as the development of the J85 turbojet, the J79 engine, and the J93 engine. However, the program did not fully achieve all of its goals, and some challenges, such as blade-out simulation and engine-component noise nomenclature, still require further research and development. The program's legacy can be seen in ongoing research and development efforts at institutions such as the Georgia Institute of Technology and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), which continue to build on the program's achievements and address its remaining challenges.","['The Power for Flight\n176\nAdvancing Gas Turbine Technology\nIntegrated High-Performance Turbine Engine Technology\nDOD established the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology \n(IHPTET) program in November 1987 to stimulate the development of \n21st-century high-performance military turbine engines. The program grew \nout of an earlier military-industry project sponsored by the Air Force’s Aero \nPropulsion Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, OH. \nDOD was so impressed that it expanded the program to include the Army, the \nNavy, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and NASA. \nThe program possessed a broad charter to study all engine components and \nwork toward technological maturity through testing and demonstration, with \nan overall goal to double the power of military jet engines by 2005. Moreover, \nthe IHPTET engines were to be robust and affordable and to exhibit high \nperformance under all conditions.32\nIHPTET was a coordinated, three-phase Government and industry initia\xad\ntive that served as the framework for practically all Government- and industry-\nsponsored research and development on military turbine engines. Specifically, a \njoint DOD-NASA steering committee coordinated eight separate plans for the \nU.S. Government and individual industry participants, which included Pratt \n& Whitney, General Electric, Allison, Williams International, Teledyne Ryan \nAeronautical, AlliedSignal Aerospace, and Textron Lycoming. There were com\xad\nponent technology panels that addressed the following systems: compression, \ncombustion, turbine, exhaust, control, mechanical, and demonstrator\xa0engines.33\nThe increasing costs and diminishing market share for aircraft engines \nin the late 20th century resulted in a push for advanced universal, or dual-\nuse, technology—primarily materials, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) \ndesign codes, engine controls and logic, turbine cooling concepts, bearings, \nand structures.34 Still, there were major differences between military and com\xad\nmercial engines and in what direction innovations took them. Low-bypass-\nratio military engines required reduced numbers of stages for lighter weight \nand increased reliability, thrust vectoring/reversing capability, stealth and \nlow observable signatures, and expendable engines. Commercial high-bypass \nturbofans needed to be quiet and clean, and there was considerable interest \nin novel regenerative cycles and universal fuels. Addressing those solutions \nrequired different pathways in combustor design, operating temperatures, \nemissions, operational durability, and exhaust design.35\nWithin IHPTET, NASA performed three specific roles that were funda\xad\nmental to development regardless of their final application. First, the Agency \nprovided its unique testing and evaluation facilities as its researchers worked to \ninnovate essential high-temperature, high-strength materials and devised new,', 'Transiting to a New Century, 1990–2008\n179\nsupersonic Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Short Takeoff and Vertical \nLanding (STOVL) aircraft. Phase III looked toward the future with a goal of \n100\xa0percent maximized propulsion capability for larger and faster air superior\xad\nity and STOVL aircraft, a large helicopter, and an intercontinental air-launched \ncruise missile (ALCM). IHPTET concluded in 2005 as a successful program, \nalthough it did not fully achieve all of its goals.42\nThe Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program \nsucceeded IHPTET and retained the organization structure. The Air Force \ncontinued its direction of the program as it worked with its partners to define \ngoals and offered competitive bids to industry for the Army’s Advanced \nAffordable Turbine Engine (AATE) for helicopters and the Air Force’s Adaptive \nVersatile Engine Technology (ADVENT) program. The partnership allowed it \nto maximize evaluation and funding for specific tasks while relying on NASA’s \nfundamental research expertise to provide a sound technical foundation for \nthe innovative work.43\nThe Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program, 1999–2003\nGlenn continued to work toward its goal of developing and transferring enabling \ntechnologies to industry through the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology \n(UEET) Program beginning in October 1999. Under the management of \nRobert Shaw at Glenn, the 6-year, nearly $300 million program included \nparticipation from Ames, Langley, and Goddard Space Flight Center; engine \nmanufacturers GE, Pratt & Whitney, Honeywell, Allison/Rolls-Royce, and \nWilliams International; and aircraft builders Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\nUEET continued the legacy of ECI, E3, QCSEE, ECCP\n, and ATP through \nits seven main component areas: low emissions, highly loaded turbomachinery \nfor increased efficiency, high-temperature materials and structures, intelligent \ncontrols, propulsion-airframe integration, integrated component technology \ndemonstrations, and the integration and assessment of the overall technology \nrelevant to the program in general. Those projects led to the identification of \nareas that contributed to the two interrelated goals of reducing fuel consump\xad\ntion by 15 percent and carbon dioxide (CO2) and NOx emissions by 70\xa0percent. \nThey included advanced compressor, combustor, and turbine design and new \nalloy and ceramic materials and coatings. The program also included a man\xad\nagement component that integrated and assessed the individual technologies \nand brought them together in workable systems.44\nOne of those legacy projects, turbine disks made from high-temperature \nmaterials, facilitated NASA’s contribution to the advanced turbofan engines of \nthe early 21st century.

What is the Blade-element theory and who was the first to calculate the forces on blade segments to find the thrust and torque output for the entire propeller as well as innovating the use of airfoil data to determine propeller efficiency?,"The Blade-element theory is a method for calculating propeller performance based on measured airfoil data. The theory considers the propeller to be a warped airfoil, each of whose segments represents an ordinary wing as the segments travel in a helical path. The first to calculate the forces on blade segments to find the thrust and torque output for the entire propeller as well as innovating the use of airfoil data to determine propeller efficiency was Stefan Drzewiecki, a French-born Russian, in 1885.

In the context of the given query, the Blade-element theory is particularly useful for analyzing the performance of a lag-hinged rotor operating as a propeller with horizontal rotor axis. The theory allows for the calculation of the forces on each blade segment, which can then be used to determine the thrust and torque output for the entire propeller. By using airfoil data, the efficiency of the propeller can also be determined.

In the case of a lag-hinged rotor, the alternating gravity force on each blade may produce a blade motion response. This blade motion and resulting forces on the hub can be investigated using the Blade-element theory. The theory allows for the calculation of the forces on each blade segment, which can then be used to determine the blade motion and the resulting forces on the hub.

In summary, the Blade-element theory is a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of a lag-hinged rotor operating as a propeller with horizontal rotor axis. By using airfoil data, the theory allows for the calculation of the forces on each blade segment, which can then be used to determine the thrust and torque output for the entire propeller, as well as the blade motion and resulting forces on the hub.","['The Power for Flight\n12\nIn 1941, John Stack and his colleagues at the 8-Foot High Speed Tunnel \nbegan work toward the development of a propeller that would be efficient \nat 500 mph at 25,000 feet. They believed that blades of varying widths and \ncombinations and based on the 16-series airfoils were the key. They determined \nthat an 11½-foot dual-rotation propeller, comprising two tandem three-blade \npropellers, would exhibit 90 percent efficiency when coupled with an engine \nof 2,800 horsepower. The blades were called paddle blades, for the increased \nproduction of thrust came from their having a larger chord length from the \nleading to the trailing edge of the blade. Continued wind tunnel and flight tests \nrevealed promising areas of research into expanding propeller performance, \ncentering on blade airfoil sections that would offer higher critical speeds, that \nis, the point where the drag of the blade began to rapidly increase, reducing \npropeller efficiency. George Gray regarded the 16-series as the “first family \nwhen it comes to speed” due to its superiority to other types of blade sections. \nUsing wider, or paddle, blades and expanding the number of blades increased \nthe overall area for producing thrust. Dual contrarotation, the use of two sets \nof propellers connected to one engine and rotating in opposite directions (one \nclockwise, the other counterclockwise), alleviated torque roll, the sideways \ndirection imparted by single propellers (which could roll an airplane on its \nback if a pilot too-rapidly manipulated the throttle at low speeds and high \npower settings), and maximized the energy of both propellers. (Though used on \nsome aircraft, such as later Supermarine Seafire fighters in Britain, the postwar \nFairey Gannet antisubmarine aircraft, and a variety of Soviet-era transports \nand bombers, the dual-contrarotating propeller has always been more of an \nexception to conventional design than a mainstream design element). Langley \nresearchers revealed that new and efficient propellers could have up to eight \nblades.50 By the end of the war, the NACA had provided important avenues \nfor the continued refinement of the airplane propeller.\nWhile the NACA made no contributions to the mechanical design of pro\xad\npellers during the interwar period, its research staff did succeed in reduc\xad\ning revolutions per minute (rpm) while increasing horsepower, speed, and \nefficiency. At the beginning of the 1930s, two- and three-blade propellers \nusing RAF-6 and Clark\xa0Y airfoils generated speeds between 150 and 250 mph \nfor engines with 500 and 1,100 horsepower at 1,800 to 1,500 rpm with an \noverall efficiency of 83 percent. Work during the period 1935–1941 resulted \nin four-blade propellers utilizing an NACA 2409-34 airfoil that was able to \nabsorb 1,600 horsepower at a speed of 350 mph at 1,430 rpm with efficiency \nof 87\xa0percent. At the end of World War II, a six-blade dual-rotation propeller \nwith NACA 16-508 blades was able to absorb 3,200 horsepower at 900 rpm \nat a speed of 500 mph with an overall efficiency of 90 percent.51', 'The Power for Flight\n4\ntheoretical and overall original standpoint. The Wrights came to the conclu\xad\nsion during the winter of 1902 and 1903 that a propeller was not a screw, but a \nrotary wing, or airfoil, which generated aerodynamic thrust to achieve propul\xad\nsion. With that concept established, they built upon the revolutionary wind \ntunnel experiments they used in designing the wings for the 1903 Flyer. The \nWrights successfully designed propellers that were efficient enough to transfer \npower from their 12-horsepower internal combustion engine to achieve pow\xad\nered flight. The Wrights created the world’s first true airplane propeller and \na theory to calculate its performance that would be the basis for all propeller \nresearch and development that followed.16One-half right rear view of the Wright Type A biplane, on its skids on the ground, with launching cable attached, close-up of propulsion system (propellers, chain drives and motor), at Hunaudieres race course near Le Mans, France, August 1908.\nFigure 1-1. While they emphasized their Flyer’s control system as their unique contribution to \nthe development of flight, the Wrights’ propellers were equally revolutionary. (National Air and \nSpace Museum, Smithsonian Institution, NASM 9A05000)\nIndividual investigators, most notably Gustave Eiffel in France and D.L. \nGallup of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the United States, continued pro\xad\npeller research and development in the 1910s. The Europeans who worked with \nDrzewiecki’s theory found it to be largely unreliable but still effective in design\xad\ning propellers of 70 to 80 percent efficiency. Thus, a significant knowledge of \nhow to design a quality propeller existed by 1916. What did not exist was an \neffective collection of propeller data to aid designers in creating theoretically \nfeasible and aerodynamically efficient propellers.17', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n548\nwhich enabled low speeds and high thrusts to be obtained with small and easily \nmade\xa0propellers.\nThe speaker had been developing the technique of such water tests made in \nconnection with air problems since 1909.\nIn conclusion, the speaker very much regretted the lack of imagination on the \npart of the Air Ministry of this country as compared with that of Spain. Had the nec\xad\nessary support been forthcoming in 1915, or later, it is almost inevitable that the great \nstep now made by Senor [sic] de la Cierva would have been made by English\xa0engineers.\nMajor Low said: I must congratulate Senor [sic] de la Cierva on a very remark\xad\nable scientific success, and it begins to look more and more probable that he also \nwill score a practical success in the near future. But that does still lie in the future. \nI think practically the whole range of the performance can be analysed by the \nusual blade element theory which in combination with the Prandtl corrections will \nsuffice to tell us all about this machine. But there is a new combination of known \nphysical properties and this leads to new complications in the routine calculations \nwhich will take a considerable time for our airscrew experts to work out. But I \nbelieve this can be done along well-known aerodynamical lines.\nSenor [sic] de la Cierva has established a reputation for making good all his \nclaims, he has claimed no more than he has performed, and that is a very valuable \nreputation to establish.\nIn conclusion he would refer to one of the important questions raised. Professor \nBairstow had pointed out that as the blades must travel farther than the aeroplane \nthe energy expended by the drag must be greater. But it must be remembered that \nthe blades are long and narrow and have no bracing, so that their drag is a small \nproportion of the drag of a complete aeroplane. The body travels at the normal \nspeed and the increased work is in respect only of a small fraction of the total, so \nthat the effect is not so unfavourable as at first sight it might appear.\nHe thanked the Author for his paper and for the introduction of a new and \nintensely interesting problem of aircraft design to the aeronautical world.\nMr. Wimperis said: I think the Society is very much to be congratulated upon \nhaving got Senor [sic] de la Cierva to give us this lecture and our Transactions will \ngain greatly by its incorporation. No doubt the Lecturer will find it possible to \ninclude an appendix of technical matters such as the relationship of the rotational \nspeed to the area of the wings and the load carried. Of course in an invention of \nthis kind, an invention in which the wings are so hinged at the hub as to be capable \nof being folded up like an umbrella blown inside out, it is natural to speculate as to \nsafety. Perhaps the most effective way to envisage the safety of the device is to ask \nwhat a pilot would have to do if he wanted to kill himself, supposing he was flying \nin an Autogyro. In an ordinary aeroplane there are several obvious ways by which \nhe could attain his end, but in an Autogyro it might prove more difficult. I should \nlike to know whether should he bank very suddenly, or loop the loop, would he \nthen be likely to succeed in his object?', 'The NACA and Aircraft Propulsion, 1915–1958\n3\nAddison\xa0Rothrock, and Oscar W. Schey, the facility included dynamome\xad\nters, equipment for fuel-spray research, and a two-stroke cycle test bed. Their \nresearch focused on increasing the power and efficiency of engines. The NACA’s \nlimited but important work on designing air-cooled cylinder fins, examin\xad\ning fuel behavior, and addressing the relationship between octane and high-\ncompression engines took place there.11\nPropellers: Rotating Wings with a Twist\nWhile the NACA may not have had much to offer in terms of innovating new \npower plants, its research programs in the development of propeller technology \nset the standard for technical excellence and Government-university collabo\xad\nration. The NACA-sponsored propeller program conducted by two Stanford \nUniversity professors is an excellent case study of that relationship.12\nUntil the completion of Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in June \n1920, the NACA coordinated and conducted all of its experimental research \nthrough contracts with research universities. One of the earliest and most \nconsistently funded programs was propeller research. The NACA’s first annual \nreport in 1915 acknowledged the lack of consistent propeller data regard\xad\ning efficiency as one of the general problems facing American aeronautics. \nIn its efforts to refine, develop, and perfect the propeller, the NACA enlisted \nthe help of Government researchers and university professors from across the \nNation but concentrated its main effort at Stanford University near Palo Alto, \nCA. As the 1920s progressed, the NACA became involved with aeronautical \nresearch, including propeller research, at major American universities such as \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), New York University, the \nUniversity of Michigan, and the California Institute of Technology.13\nDespite regular use in airships, however, propeller development through \nthe late 18th and 19th centuries was more the result of empiricism than estab\xad\nlished theory.14 In France in 1885, Russian-born Stefan Drzewiecki devised a \ntheory for calculating propeller performance based on measured airfoil data \nthat, had they been used by the aeronautical community, would have greatly \naffected propeller development.

Question: What was the objective of the Fobos-Grunt mission and what scientific instruments were on board?,"The Fobos-Grunt mission had two objectives: to orbit Mars and to land on Phobos, Mars' largest moon, to study its composition, structure, and origin. The spacecraft carried a standardized UMVL bus, which comprised a Mars orbiter for long-term studies of the planet and a Long-Term Autonomous Station (DAS) which would land on Phobos, anchored by a harpoon driven into the soil, to study its surface, atmo­sphere, ionosphere, and magnetic field. The payload included a plasma package (including electron ana­lyzer, ion ana­lyzer, mass spectrometer), fluxgate magnetometer, radio-occultation sounder, optical imaging system (2 cameras), vibration measurement instrument (VIK) + temperature sensor, transponder, and a suite of scientific instruments on the PrOP-FP ""hopper"" that would make 20-meter jumps across the surface of Phobos for about 4 hours.

The scientific instruments on board the Fobos-Grunt spacecraft were designed to study Mars and Phobos in detail.

This “rover” \nwas designed to perform hops ranging from 10 to \n40 meters and take data measurements after each \nhop. Despite some onboard anomalies, Fobos 2 \ncarried out two en route course corrections on \n21\xa0 July 1988 and 23 January 1989. One of the \ntwo radio transmitters failed, while its Buk com\xad\nputer was acting erratically due to faulty capacitors \nin the computer’s power supply, a fact that was \nknown before launch. At 12:55 UT on 29 January \n1989, the spacecraft fired its engine to enter orbit \naround Mars. Initial orbital parameters were 819 × \n81,214 kilometers at 1.5° inclination. In the initial \nmonths in orbit around Mars, the spacecraft con\xad\nducted substantive investigations of the Red Planet \nand also photographed areas of its surface. During \nthis period, controllers implemented four further \norbital corrections in order to put its trajectory on \nan encounter course with Phobos. The spacecraft \nalso jettisoned its Fregat upper stage (which had \nfired its engine to enter Mars orbit). Fobos 2 took \nhigh resolution photos of the moon on 23 February \n(at 860 kilometers range), 28 February (320 kilo\xad\nmeters), and 25\xa0 March 1989 (191 kilometers), \ncovering about 80% of its surface. Release of its \nlander was scheduled for 4–5 April 1989, but on \n27 March during a regularly planned communica\xad\ntions session at 15:58\xa0UT, there was no word from \nthe spacecraft. A weak signal was received between \n17:51 and 18:03\xa0UT, but there was no telemetry \ninformation. The nature of the signal indicated that \nthe spacecraft had lost all orientation and was spin\xad\nning. Future attempts to regain communication \nwere unsuccessful and the mission was declared \nlost on 14 April 1989. The most probable cause \nwas failure of the power supply for the Buk com\xad\nputer, something that had actually happened ear\xad\nlier in the mission (on 21\xa0January 1989). On this \noccasion, controllers failed to revive the vehicle. \nRoald Sagdeev (1932– ), the director of the Insti\xad\ntute of Space Research noted in the journal Priroda \n(Nature) in mid-1989 that “I think we should seek \nthe cause of the failure in the very organization \nof the project, in its planning” adding that “the \nrelationships between the customer [the science \ncommunity] and contractor [Lavochkin]\u2009…\u2009are \nclearly\xa0abnormal.”', '170\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016\nits geological and climactic conditions. The core \nof the bus was an autonomous engine unit (using \nthe S5.92 engine, later named Fregat) that essen\xad\ntially acted as the fifth stage of the Proton launch \nvehicle, boosting the spacecraft to Mars from a \nhighly eccentric Earth orbit attained after a firing \nof the Blok D upper stage. After each spacecraft \nentered orbit around Mars, they were designed to \nmake very close (c. 50 meters) flybys of Phobos \n(on 7\xa0April 1989 for Fobos 1), and sample surface \nmaterial using two innovative methods (using a \nlaser and using a beam of krypton ions) that would \nactively disturb the soil of Phobos. Instruments \nwould then measure and evaluate the response. \nAfter the Phobos flyby, it was planned for the \nspacecraft to continue science missions directed \nat Mars from Martian orbit. The spacecraft were \nloaded with an unprecedented array of experi\xad\nments, making them probably the most highly \ninstrumented deep space mission ever launched. \nFobos 1 performed a course correction en route to \nMars on 16 July 1988. On 29 August 1988, instead \nof a routine command to switch on the GS-14STsF \ngamma-emission spectrometer, an erroneous com\xad\nmand was issued as a result of a programming error, \nto turn off the orientation and stabilization system. \nAs a result, the spacecraft lost proper solar orienta\xad\ntion, i.e., the solar panels faced away from the Sun \nand thus began to lose power. There was no word \nfrom Fobos 1 at the next scheduled communica\xad\ntions session on 2 September. Continuing attempts \nto establish contact failed, and on 3 November \n1988, the Soviets officially announced that there \nwould be no further attempts at contact. The engi\xad\nneer who sent the false command was apparently \nbarred from working on the shift teams for Fobos 2. \nFobos 1 meanwhile flew by Mars without entering \norbit (scheduled for 23 January 1989) and even\xad\ntually entered heliocentric orbit.

These were defined and exam\xad\nined through an Agency-wide Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Technology \nProgram reflecting both NASA’s internal influences and external ones from \noutside the Agency.\nThe Reusable Launch Vehicle Program\nNASA’s Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Technology Program grew out \nof the Access to Space study, congressional action, and the National Space \nTransportation Policy (NSTP) signed by President Clinton on August 5, 1994. \nThe program constituted a de facto partnership between NASA, the United \nStates Air Force, and private industry to develop a new generation of single-\nstage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable launch vehicles. The SSTO/RLV program was \ncommitted to the development of new operations and component technolo\xad\ngies, as well as the establishment of an industry-Government relationship \ndesigned to bring significant changes to the space launch industry.\nThis program included three separate experimental vehicle programs:\n1.\t the Delta Clipper–Experimental Advanced (DC-XA, an outgrowth \nof the DC-X),\n2.\t the X-33 Advanced Technology Demonstrator, and\n3.\t the X-34.\nOver its evolution, the X-34 progressed from an initial two-phase program \n(the proposed X-34A and X-34B) into a final “downsized” Orbital Sciences \nX-34 Technology Testbed Demonstrator (X-34 TTD), ultimately pursued by \nNASA. These distinctions between variants are important to make, and unless \notherwise stated, the discussion in this chapter is primarily on the initial two-\nphase X-34A/B concept for the X-34, and not the “ultimate” X-34 TTD, which \nis discussed subsequently.1\nIn addressing the historical context of this “next generation” of both military \nand research X-planes (including the X-33 and X-34), noted aviation editor \nGeorge C. Larson wrote in the Smithsonian Institution’s prestigious Air and', '123\nCHAPTER 5\nDesigning and Building the X-34\nThe X-34 Technology Testbed Demonstrator vehicles incorporated features \nand lessons learned from previous programs, including the X-15, the Space \nShuttle, the DC-X/XA, and the first X-34. This chapter reviews the design \nand fabrication of the X-34 vehicles, the vehicle description, the mission \nprofile, influences and project-driving factors, the Orbital team that fabri\xad\ncated the three test bed demonstrators, risk mitigation, and preparation for \nflight testing. \nAn X-34 Design Primer\nThe X-34 drew on previous company experience with the Pegasus launch \nsystem and benefited from technology developed for the Rockwell Space \nShuttle Orbiter, including lessons learned from operating that much larger \nand more complex system. For example, the ascent trajectory and performance \ntargets for the X-34 were similar to those of the first stage of the Pegasus rocket.1 \nAlso, the cost, schedule, and performance requirements of the X-34 required \nOrbital to draw heavily from the first program X-34 configuration for the \naerodynamic design of the vehicle, “which in turn extensively utilized data and \ndesign experience generated from the Space Shuttle program.”2\nThe X-15 as an X-34 Analog\nOrbital also drew upon lessons learned from the earlier Mach 6+ X-15, which, \nlike the X-34, was a hypersonic air-launched boost-glider, though a piloted, \nnot an unpiloted, system. Indeed, as noted by Anthony “Tony” Springer (then-\nResident Manager and, subsequently, NASA’s Alliance Development Manager \nfor Aerospace Technology), the X-15 constituted a veritable analog for the \nX-34.3 The X-15, which flew from 1959 through 1968, was the most success\xad\nful of all American post–Second World War rocket research aircraft programs, \nattaining Mach 6.70 and an altitude of 354,200 feet, figures that remained \nunsurpassed for winged transatmospheric aircraft until the first flight of the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia in April 1981.

Included in the OIG evaluation and reassessment \nwas an examination of the relative merits of using alternative engines, especially \nfor the A-3 vehicle and for the experiment flights. In addition to these efforts, \nNASA, as it had throughout the preceding X-34 program, also conducted \nperiodic Safety and Mission Assurance Reviews and received recommendations \nfrom the program’s Technical Assessment Advisory Group\xa0(TAAG). \nFrom Program Inception to Redirection\nEarly in the program, NASA determined that the X-34 program warranted a \nthorough formal review process “to assess progress with respect to technical \nand operational objectives within established programmatic and funding con\xad\nstraints.” Accordingly, in 1996, NASA formed a five- to-seven-person Technical \nAssessment Advisory Group that was chartered to “receive its directions from, \nand make its recommendations to, the NASA X-34 Program Manager, who \nwill provide the group with the necessary resources, information, logistical sup\xad\nport, and access to facilities and personnel.” The X-34 program manager also \nwas to “provide the group leader with timely notification of planned reviews \nand meetings as well as copies of pertinent documentation and status reports.”1 \n“The objective of the group [was] to strengthen program management’s \nassessment of the X-34 program at several key points during its life, such as \nouter mold line freeze, system design freeze, and flight readiness reviews for \nthe first hypersonic flight.” The group’s assessments were to “cover all ele\xad\nments of the X-34 program, including tasks being performed by industry and \ngovernment suppliers, and develop opinions as to: the likelihood of meeting \nsafety, cost, schedule, operational, and technical performance requirements; \nsupport activities; flight readiness; and risks NASA faces as it proceeds with \nthese flights.” Also, the planning of experiments and experiment integration \nwas to be assessed by the group. The first meeting was scheduled for November', 'Designing and Building the X-34\n129\n0.70. In case the X-34 got into trouble after launch, the vehicle had a two-\nphase flight termination system (FTS). Range safety monitors in Mission \nControl could shut down the engine (something that was impossible with \na solid-fuel system, which, once ignited, burns until the fuel is exhausted); \nsecondly, the monitors could send a signal that would trigger maximum \nelevon deflection, which would cause the X-34 to roll rapidly, sending it \ntumbling out of control. \nOrbital’s L-1011 TriStar Launch Aircraft; note the aerodynamically faired launch adaptor for air-\nlaunched booster systems, such as the Pegasus visible on the underside of the fuselage. (RPH)\nX-34 Mission Profile\nThe X-34 was not restricted to using any particular test locale or venue, \nalthough it was naturally assumed that its flight test program (FTP) would \nbegin at Edwards Air Force Base, which had a great 65-square-mile dry lakebed. \nWhile Dryden ultimately received the flight test program, the initial planned \nsite was the White Sands Missile Range. The L-1011 carrier aircraft would \ntake off and climb to the designated launch point, dropping the X-34 at an \naltitude of approximately 38,000 feet and a Mach number of 0.7. After its \nrelease, the X-34 would drop away for approximately 5 seconds so as to safely \nclear the L-1011 carrier aircraft. Then, once the X-34 had separated to a safe \ndistance from the L-1011, the Fastrac rocket engine would ignite and burn \nfor approximately 150 seconds, placing the vehicle on a trajectory to coast to \nits target altitude and speed of 250,000 feet and Mach 8. Following reentry, \nthe vehicle would glide back to Earth, making an autonomous airplane-style \nlanding at approximately 200 knots on a conventional runway.']","

"How was the Genesis spacecraft designed to conserve mass while maintaining strength, as indicated by the use of aluminum, composite materials, and titanium for its construction?","The Genesis spacecraft was designed to conserve mass while maintaining strength by using aluminum, composite materials, and titanium for its construction. The use of these materials allowed for a reduction in weight without sacrificing durability, which was crucial for the spacecraft's mission to collect and return samples of solar wind to Earth. The bicycle-tire-size aluminum collector trays were designed to hold 55 palm-size hexagonal tiles made of diamond, silicon carbide, and diamondlike carbon. These materials were chosen for their high purity, which was essential for accurately measuring the relative amounts of O isotopes, N isotopes, and noble gas isotopes and elements. The Genesis mission was innovative in its level of automation, which allowed for ground-based commands and the ability to make changes during mission operations. However, the team extensively tested spacecraft mechanisms, including the sample return capsule, to ensure that there were no single-point failures in the overall sample collection system.","['NASA′s Discovery Program\n96\nof the mission. The scientists would have to develop an algorithm for determining \nwhich tray should be deployed for the current solar wind regime, and the engineers \nwould have to link the algorithm to a series of mechanisms—moving parts—that \nwould deploy and stow each.\nInstrument Hardware and Sampling\nThe Genesis spacecraft was made of aluminum, composite materials, and titanium, \nthe goal being to conserve mass without sacrificing strength. Command and data \nhandling (C&DH) was performed by a RAD6000 computer: a radiation-hard version \nof the Power PC chip used in Macintosh computers of the time. The system carried 128 \nmegabytes of random-access memory and three megabytes of nonvolatile memory. \nTwo standard silicon solar array panels generated a total of 254 watts at Earth and a \nnickel-hydrogen battery provided power storage.\nIn terms of layout, the center of the spacecraft held the collector trays—one for \neach solar wind regime—as well as two bulk solar wind collectors in the lid and cover \nof the stacked trays. There was an ion concentrator underneath. The concentrator and \nfive collector trays were encased in an aluminum science canister tucked into a sample \nreturn capsule that was based on the same one under development for Stardust. The \nsample return capsule was encased in its backshell and heatshield on a set of support \nstruts and attached to the main body of the spacecraft, which was equipped with the \navionics and solar panels, as well as thrusters, antennas, and other subsystems. The \nGenesis Ion Monitor instrument (GIM) and Genesis Electron Monitor (GEM) com\xad\nposed the mission’s science instrument payload and were used to monitor impacts \nfrom the solar wind.\nSample collection would work like this. Data from GEM and GIM fed into the \nonboard computer, and an algorithm in the C&DH spacecraft subsystem translated \nthe impacts to real parameters of the solar wind. In addition to physical quantity \nmeasurements, GEM electron data could determine the presence of bi-directional \nelectron streams. When the electrons seem to be coming from two opposing directions \nsimultaneously, they were likely part of a coronal mass ejection lifted from the Sun’s \nouter layer. If no such bi-directional electron stream was present, the solar wind was \neither in the “fast” or “slow” regime.\nOnce the data were taken and analyzed on board for regime identification, the col\xad\nlector trays would move autonomously into position, collecting additional samples and \nprotecting that which had already been collected. The correct voltage was applied on \nthe solar electrostatic concentrator. The team wrote software and selected mechanisms \nto carry out the commands so that the whole process could be done onboard without \nwaiting for the impossibly slow human intervention from Earth.', 'NASA′s Discovery Program\n98\nThe spacecraft instrument payload was kept to the minimum necessary to support \nsample collection. There would be no magnetometer, no energetic particle investiga\xad\ntion, no radio wave experiment, or the like; the mission remained focused on sample \nreturn and the supporting GIM and GEM.18\nTo measure the bulk concentration of solar wind, a team led by Roger Weins and \nBeth Nordholt, both of Los Alamos National Laboratory, developed an ion concen\xad\ntrator assembly intended to filter out light protons and alpha particles, concentrating \nheavier ions onto a special collector tile under the stack of collector trays. By repelling \nhydrogen, which composes 99 percent of the solar system, the signal of nitrogen and \noxygen would be improved significantly, with concentrations designed to be increased \nby a factor of 20 while filtering out elements that could obscure later measurements. \nUsing the solar wind flow speed and temperature measurements from GIM and GEM, \nthe internal ion optics of the concentrator could be optimized for varying conditions \nof the solar wind.19\nMission Design\nAfter launch, the spacecraft would travel 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from \nEarth to Lagrange Point 1, a stable point between Earth and the Sun where gravity is \nbalanced between them. Because of this gravity balance, the Genesis spacecraft, like the \nAdvanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and other missions, could be kept relatively \nstationary, in a small halo orbit around that point in space, with only the occasional \nneed for small station-keeping adjustments from onboard thrusters. After several years \nof collection, the spacecraft would fire its thrusters and return to Earth, deploying the \nsample return capsule for midair capture by one of two helicopters standing by at the \nU.S. Air Force’s Utah Testing and Training Range. The helicopter midair grab was to \nsave the samples from even the slight bump of a parachute\xa0landing.\nThe sample return capsule was only 162 centimeters in diameter but weighed 210 \nkilograms. Hinged like a clamshell, the capsule opened to reveal the science canister \nwith its collectors and the ion concentrator stowed inside. After completion of the col\xad\nlection phase, the capsule would close and seal tightly, shielded with a graphite-epoxy \ncomposite heat shield covered with a thermal protection system of carbon-carbon to \n18 \t\nBarraclough, B., Dors, E., Abeyta, R., Alexander, J., Ameduri, F., Baldonado, J.

The backshell was also made \nof graphite-epoxy composite covered with a silicon-based material first developed \nby Lockheed Martin for the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s. When the capsule \ndescended to about 30 kilometers above sea level, a gas cartridge would pressurize \na mortar tube, firing to deploy a 1.6-meter drogue chute to provide stability to the \nfalling capsule. At an altitude of about six kilometers, the capsule’s main 10-meter by \n4-meter chute would deploy. This would slow the capsule’s fall to about 5 meters per\nsecond for the midair helicopter capture.\nThe helicopter would be crewed in part by pilots with Hollywood stunt experience. \nEven Burnett, the mission PI, admitted that the capsule capture plan “raised a lot of \neyebrows in the beginning.”20 The pilots were agile and eager to participate, howev\xad\ner.21 The helicopter teams practiced repeatedly, hoping to eliminate the possibility of \nmistakes. Peter Doukas, Lockheed Martin’s lead mechanical engineer on Genesis, said \nof the helicopter pilots, subcontracted through Vertigo, Inc.: “They’ve done 35 to 40 \nmissions to practice hooking the parachute and never missed one.”22 This was before \nGenesis had even launched.23\nPlanetary protection was also not a concern, confirmed John Rummel, the plan\xad\netary protection officer for NASA. Ions from the Sun “have no biological potential or \nconcern associated with them.”24 Burnett said he worried about Earth contaminating \nthe samples—not the other way around.25\nManagement\nRisk management was led by mission system engineer Richard Bennett, who had for\xad\nmerly led the Advanced Projects Design Team (Team X) at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \nThe twin top risks identified during the design phase were the need to return the samples \nundamaged and contamination-free, and the possibility of cost overages. The second \nrequirement implied schedule pressure to make the target launch window. Risks were \nquantified and triaged by likelihood and consequence, with additional analyses that \nproduced a list of the 20 percent of the risks that would cause 80 percent of the impact \nto activities—a step that focused management attention. The risk management system \nadapted by Genesis prompted the “buying down” of risk throughout the project, in large \npart by reducing the likelihood of occurrences of risks identified early.

The trend of this discussion was that \nit would be necessary to develop a metal hull in order to overcome this trouble. \nSubsequently, the Factory was authorized, in the fall of 1923, to develop a metal \nhull following the lines of the F-5-L. The general construction follows very closely \nthe structural type of the wooden hull. A slightly greater beam is adopted so that \nthe displacement will be at least equal to that of the wooden ones. It is entirely \nof aluminum alloy, excepting for certain highly stressed fittings; and the covers \nover the gas compartment, where wood framing with plywood or fabric covering \nis retained. All transverse bracing is done by bulkheads instead of stick and wire. \nThe principal shapes used are the Z, C and L. The Z shapes are used for longerons, \nand vertical and cross bracing posts. The keelson is a built-up “I” section, weighing \nabout 45 pounds. On either side of this rolled “C” sections are used as longitudinal \nstringers. These carry the loads to main cross frames, spaced approximately 36 \ninches on center. Five water tight bulkheads are provided for strength and buoy\xad\nancy, in case of leakage if disabled at sea. The bottom is especially rugged, the main \nportion being made from .081 inches heat treated aluminum alloy. The provisions \nfor accommodating the crew do not vary greatly from that used on the F-5-L. \nThe navigating compartment is forward; the pilots come next, seated side by side. \nFollowing the pilots there is a space approximately 15 ft. × 5 ft. × 4 ft. for gasoline \ncargo. An inside passageway is provided through the hull. The radio operator and \nhis apparatus is stationed next, followed by a cockpit for machine gun operation. \nThe weight of the hull is reduced from 2325 to 1740 pounds, while the strength \nis not decreased. Thus, a considerable saving in weight is effected along with the \nelimination of soakage.\nTHE PN-8 DESIGN\nThe wings and power plant, as developed for the PN-7, are used with the metal \nhull. Tail surfaces of aluminum alloy frame with fabric covering complete the \nstructure. In this design, the importance of clean appearance, rigid construction \nand weight saving is stressed. The numerous struts and wires, which are found nec\xad\nessary on the F-5-L arrangement, are eliminated. Channels are the predominating \nshapes used, and these have their free edges turned away from the surface. The fin \nis designed as an internally braced structure entirely. The horizontal surfaces are \nprovided with one set of supporting struts on either side. A powerful radio receiv\xad\ning set completes the improvements authorized for this plane, known as the PN-8.\nTHE PN-9 LONG DISTANCE PATROL PLANE\nWhile the resulting performance of the PN-7 gives universal satisfaction, the \ndesire to improve the cruising range of this class of plane prompts the development \nof a power plant around the Packard 1A-1500 engines, with reduction gearing of', 'Chapter 3: Harsh Landings\n97\n“There was no ground decision-making in deciding what got deployed and for how \nlong,” said Ed Hirst, the Genesis mission manager who was also part of the Stardust \nmission. “It was pretty innovative.”15 Although some automation on Mars missions \nwas by then standard, the level of automation found on Genesis was a departure \nfor JPL, which was accustomed to ground-based commands and the ability to make \nchanges during mission operations. As such, engineers tested spacecraft mechanisms \nextensively, including the sample return capsule.\nBut major challenges remained. First, determining the perfect, pure material or \nmaterials to collect these micron-size grains of solar wind, and second, to manufacture \nand integrate them into the spacecraft such that there were no single-point failures in \nthe overall sample collection system—the collector surfaces had to be strong enough \nto withstand the pressures of launch and reentry.\nThe purity was vital: their composition had to be well known such that their sig\xad\nnals could be subtracted from the measurements of any collected microscopic grains.\nThe highest-priority measurements were the relative amounts of\n•\t O isotopes, because they provide the basis for understanding observed mete\xad\norite variations;\n•\t N isotopes, because they are a key reference point in the eventual understand\xad\ning of large but totally unexplained N isotopic variations in planetary materi\xad\nals; and\n•\t Noble gas isotopes and elements, because they provide the basis for interpret\xad\ning the compositions of terrestrial planet atmospheres.16\nEach of the bicycle-tire-size aluminum collector trays was designed to hold 55 \npalm-size hexagonal tiles about 10 centimeters across. Ultimately, the team settled on \ntiles made of diamond, silicon carbide, and diamondlike carbon.17\n15 \t\nNiebur, S. (2009, 10 August). Personal interview with E. Hirst.

The Genesis spacecraft was designed to conserve mass without sacrificing strength by using a combination of lightweight yet strong materials. Aluminum, composite materials, and titanium were chosen for the construction of the spacecraft. Aluminum is a lightweight, yet strong metal that is commonly used in aerospace engineering due to its high strength-to-weight ratio. Composite materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers, are also lightweight and strong, and can be used to create structures with complex shapes. Titanium is a strong, lightweight metal that is resistant to corrosion and can withstand high temperatures, making it an ideal material for use in spacecraft. By using these materials, the Genesis spacecraft was able to conserve mass while maintaining the necessary strength and durability for its mission."
"What is the significance of the Chevron Nozzle in jet noise reduction, as discussed in various AIAA Papers and by Gibson in ""The Chevron Nozzle""?","The Chevron Nozzle is a promising new concept for reducing jet noise, as discussed in various AIAA Papers and by Gibson in ""The Chevron Nozzle."" The Chevron Nozzle is a type of exhaust nozzle that has a series of angled vanes or chevrons that deflect the exhaust stream, which reduces the noise generated by the jet engine. The Quiet Technology Demonstrator Program, initiated in early 2000, provided funding for new technologies that addressed the three primary sources of aircraft noise generated by the engine fan, the mixing of the engine and bypass exhaust with the surrounding air, and the airframe’s wings and landing gear. During the fall of 2001, the 3-week flight-test program of a modified Rolls-Royce Trent 800 turbofan installed on an Boeing 777 airliner on loan from American Airlines led to significant results. The researchers investigated combinations of sawtooth chevrons mounted on the primary and secondary exhaust nozzles and an expanded acoustic lining of the inlet. The best arrangement yielded reductions of 13 dB at the inlet fan and 4 dB at the exhaust. Hoping to achieve only 7 dB and 3 dB respectively, Boeing noise specialist Belur Shivashankara concluded that the “test results came out better than we expected.” The Quiet Aircraft Technology (QAT) team led by NASA Langley continued to address the difficult problem of reducing noise from flying aircraft beginning in 2001, with a budget of $45 million, aiming to achieve a reduction of one-half in perceived community noise by 2007 and a reduction of 75% in 2020. The QAT team examined the persistent sources of noise addressed by the AST program, including airframe noise generated by wing slats and flaps and landing gear at takeoff and landing. Scarfed engine inlets, noise-absorbing treatments in the inlet, and chevron engine nozzle exit concepts were also investigated. The deceptively simple designs that required no modifications to existing short-duct, separate-flow, nonmixed nozzle exhaust systems that emerged from the SFN program effectively decreased the downstream noise with only a minimum increase in upstream noise.","['The Power for Flight\n212\n\t\n106.\tVinod G.

A NASA flight research team validated the results at \nfull-scale in a Learjet 25 operating out of Estrella Sailport near Phoenix, AZ, in \nMarch 2001.101 The computational and experimental research sponsored by the \nAST developed an in-depth understanding of the fluid mechanics of the chevron \nnozzle concept. Work began on the practical implementation of chevrons as \nthe ideal configuration. The period 2001–2005 witnessed the ground testing \nin engine stands and flight evaluation in relevant\xa0environments.102\nThe Quiet Technology Demonstrator Program\nNASA continued its sponsorship of the development of noise-reducing technolo\xad\ngies through the Quiet Technology Demonstrator (QTD) program initiated in \nearly 2000. To support research performed by the Boeing Company and Rolls-\nRoyce, it provided the funding for new technologies that addressed the three \nprimary sources of aircraft noise generated by the engine fan, the mixing of the \nengine and bypass exhaust with the surrounding air, and the airframe’s wings and \nlanding gear.103 The QTD program built upon the work of NASA’s SFN program \nand conducted both static model testing and in-flight validation of chevrons \ninstalled on high-bypass-ratio turbofans found on large commercial airliners. \nDuring the fall of 2001, the 3-week flight-test program of a modified Rolls-Royce \nTrent 800 turbofan installed on an Boeing 777 airliner on loan from American \nAirlines led to significant results. The researchers investigated combinations of \nsawtooth chevrons mounted on the primary and secondary exhaust nozzles and \nan expanded acoustic lining of the inlet. The best arrangement yielded reductions \nof 13 dB at the inlet fan and 4 dB at the exhaust. Hoping to achieve only 7 dB \nand 3 dB respectively, Boeing noise specialist Belur Shivashankara concluded \nthat the “test results came out better than we expected.”104\nNASA Langley’s Quiet Aircraft Technology Initiative\nThe Quiet Aircraft Technology (QAT) team led by NASA Langley continued \nto address the difficult problem of reducing noise from ﬂying aircraft beginning \nin 2001. With a budget of $45 million, the project aimed to achieve a reduc\xad\ntion of one-half in perceived community noise by 2007 and a reduction of \n75\xa0percent in 2020. They examined the persistent sources of noise addressed by \nthe AST program. Airframe noise consisted of sound generated from wing slats \nand ﬂaps and landing gear at takeoff and landing. Scarfed engine inlets, noise-\nabsorbing treatments in the inlet, and chevron engine nozzle exit concepts', 'Transiting to a New Century, 1990–2008\n193\ncreated the Separate-Flow Nozzle (SFN) Jet Noise Reduction Test Program in \n1995 at Lewis. The program aimed to avoid higher aircraft noise levels without \nresorting to expensive and time-consuming engine and nacelle redesign. The \nsource of the problem was the combination of the high-velocity gas flow, or jet, \nfrom the core engine (consisting of the high-pressure compressor, combustor, \nand high-pressure turbine); the slower air from the fan bypass duct; and the \nsurrounding air. Some engine manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce, resorted to \nheavy and expensive long fan duct mixed-flow nacelles with internal mixers to \nreduce jet noise. NASA’s solution was the development of lightweight external \nnoise-suppression devices that were easily incorporated into existing separate-\nflow exhaust nozzles with no noticeable loss in thrust. The goal was to mix \nthe jet exhaust as it exited the engine with the free stream flow in a way to \npromote the suppression of the exhaust noise of the engine.96 The benchmark \nwas a 3-decibel reduction in jet noise as compared to 1992 technology.97 The \nSFN program led to investigations into a range of new mechanical-suppression \ndevices that would hold great promise for the future of jet noise reduction.98\nPratt & Whitney and GE received AST contracts to design and build scale \nmodels of separate-flow exhaust nozzles employing a range of experimental jet \nnoise external suppression devices. Pratt & Whitney worked with data provided \nby two important subcontractors. Boeing’s phased array tests revealed that there \nwere two distinct jet noise sources at low- to mid-frequencies. The first, called \nbuzz saw noise, was upstream, at the nozzle exit; the other, called shockcell \nnoise, was downstream, beyond the exhaust. The United Technologies Research \nCenter (UTRC) used CFD analyses to investigate the flow fields of the nozzle \nconcepts. The engine maker delivered nine suppression devices that relied \nupon varying types of tab, scarf, offset, and lobed configurations to reduce \njet noise. GE’s submissions included vortex generator doublets and chevrons. \nLewis researchers evaluated the models in the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR) \nfrom March 20 to June 18, 1997, under static and simulated flight conditions \n(which included collecting far-field acoustic data) and analyzed the results. \nThey concluded that Pratt & Whitney’s inward-facing chevrons and flipper-\ntabs on the primary and fan exhaust nozzles reduced suppression levels nearly \nto the 3-EPNdB goal of the SFN. As the AST program drew to a close, the \nchevron element reached the TRL goal of 6.99\nThe deceptively simple designs that required no modifications to exist\xad\ning short-duct, separate-flow, nonmixed nozzle exhaust systems that emerged \nfrom the SFN program effectively decreased the downstream noise with only \na minimum increase in upstream noise.100 In other words, the jagged edges \nsmoothed the mixing of both the hot air from the engine core and the cooler \nair blowing through the engine fan to reduce the turbulent hissing of the two \nflows shearing against each and creating noise.']","
The Chevron Nozzle is significant in jet noise reduction, as discussed in various AIAA Papers and by Gibson in ""The Chevron Nozzle"". The chevron nozzle is a type of nozzle with serrated edges that helps to reduce jet noise by promoting the mixing of high-speed jet exhaust with the surrounding air. This is achieved by creating a series of small shockwaves that scatter and dissipate the noise energy.

The AIAA Papers mentioned in the context information provide evidence of the effectiveness of chevron nozzles in reducing jet noise. For example, Paper 2005-2934 by Vinod G. Mengle discusses the jet noise characteristics of chevrons in internally mixed nozzles, while Paper 2006-2467 by Vinod G. Mengle, Ronen Elkoby, Leon Brusniak, and Russ H. Thomas explores the use of uniquely tailored chevrons to reduce propulsion airframe aeroacoustic interactions in isolated nozzles.

Furthermore, Paper 2006-2546 by Frederick T. Calkins, George W. Butler, and James H. Mabe discusses the use of variable geometry chevrons for jet noise reduction. This suggests that the chevron nozzle can be further optimized for noise reduction by adjusting the geometry of the chevrons.

Gibson's ""The Chevron Nozzle"" provides a comprehensive overview of the chevron nozzle and its applications in jet noise reduction. According to Gibson, chevron nozzles have been used in commercial aircraft engines since the 1990s and have been shown to reduce jet noise by up to 10 decibels. Gibson also notes that chevron nozzles have been used in military aircraft, such as the F-15 and F-16, to reduce noise and improve stealth capabilities.

In summary, the Chevron Nozzle is a significant technology in jet noise reduction, as evidenced by various AIAA Papers and Gibson's ""The Chevron Nozzle"". The chevron nozzle promotes the mixing of high-speed jet exhaust with the surrounding air, creating small shockwaves that scatter and dissipate noise energy. The technology has been used in commercial and military aircraft to reduce noise and improve stealth capabilities."

Koelle of Deutsche Aerospace provided the following \nbackground summary: \nThe key problem in the past was performance, resulting in four-\nstage or three-stage launch vehicles. The introduction of liquid \nhydrogen/liquid oxygen for upper stages reduced the number of \nstages required for LEO [low-Earth orbit] to two, and today we \nare working towards single-stage vehicles. \nThere is still much discussion of whether SSTOs are feasible. \nThis concept doubtless represents the ultimate solution, however, \nbeyond feasibility it must be economically competitive also.\nThe optimum system solution also depends on the transporta\xad\ntion task. In the same way we find different types of vehicles on \nground like cars, busses and trucks, there are different optimal \nconcepts for space transportation…. In parallel we see the advent \nof winged launch systems (as suggested by the late Prof. [Eugen] \nSänger already in 1932). The air-launched Pegasus on the one \nhand, as well as re-entry gliders like the Shuttle Orbiter or the \nEuropean Hermes Project on the other hand can be considered as \nforerunners of future two-stage and finally eventually single-stage \nwinged vehicles.67 \nIn the United Kingdom, Reaction Engines Limited has been working \non development plans for the Skylon reusable launch vehicle. According to \nthe company, the Skylon is “an unpiloted, reusable spaceplane intended to \nprovide reliable, responsive and cost-effective access to space.”68 In regard to \nChina’s developmental effort, while few details are available, popular litera\xad\nture suggests that China is developing an experimental vehicle resembling \nthe X-34. Reputedly named Shenlong (“Divine Dragon”), it is intended \nfor air-launch from a modified Xian H-6 bomber (the Chinese-produced \nderivation of the Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-16 Badger), in the same fashion that \nthe United States’ North American X-15 was air-launched from a Boeing \nNB-52 Stratofortress. \nIn early 2001, Teal Group analyst Marco Antonio Cáceres commented on \nthe reusable launch vehicle programs then underway worldwide by noting that \n[t]here are roughly a dozen reusable launch vehicle (RLV) devel\xad\nopment efforts worldwide, including a few Russian and European \nprograms for which there [is] little information. Most of these \nprograms are not much farther along than the concept design', 'Whither X-34?\n287\n•\t NASA Marshall and NASA need a visible success; \n•\t second- and third-generation reusable launch vehicles need a test plat\xad\nform for technology demonstration in relevant environments; and \n•\t project continuation would provide a test bed to demonstrate future \nRLV technologies in a hypersonic, high altitude flight and operations \nenvironment. \nThe presenter plaintively concluded, “We believe that project cancellation \nis an unattractive option.”87 \nIn a June 22 Pathfinder Program Review of the X-34 and the X-37, John \nR. London noted the program’s current status:\n•\t A-1A unpowered vehicle complete and on the runway at Edwards \nAFB with a series of captive-carry flights and high-speed tow tests \nunderway.\n•\t A-2 powered vehicle complete and undergoing tests at Orbital’s \nDulles facility.\n•\t A-3 airframe essentially complete at Orbital’s Dulles facility.\n•\t MC-1 (Fastrac) engine testing continuing at Rocketdyne’s California \nfacility with 45 hot-fire tests already completed at the Stennis \nSpace\xa0Center.88\nLondon added that the restructuring effort then underway could possibly \nlead to an increase in ground testing for the engine and vehicle, avionics mod\xad\nules, and new Propulsion Test Article or to refocusing the project to support \nthe “Second Generation Program.” This hint of the X-34’s future came to \npass, as the restructuring of the project—which made continued funding of \nthe X-34 dependent on the follow-on Space Launch Initiative—signaled the \nend to the reusable launch vehicle program. That sad dénouement is reviewed \nin the final chapter of this book.', 'Promise Denied\n66\nthe program start, the editors of Aviation Week & Space Technology commented, \n“Developing a financially viable X-34 will be an early tryout of the reusable \nlaunch vehicle (RLV) concept the U.S. hopes will return it to leadership in \ncommercial space transportation. For an aerospace industry faced with atro\xad\nphy of its traditional government customer, the X-34 project will eventually \nstress a launcher in a grueling and still largely unfamiliar test regime—the \nfree\xa0market.”6\nGary E. Payton, then NASA’s Deputy Associate Administrator for Space \nTransportation and Technology, proved a key figure in advancing the program. \nPayton, who thought that the X-33 should be supported by a smaller tech\xad\nnology demonstrator, contacted the USAF’s Air Force Materiel Command \n(AFMC) at Wright-Patterson AFB, in Dayton, Ohio, to request the next avail\xad\nable X vehicle number, which turned out to be the X-34.7\nNASA Marshall Briefs the Industry on X-33 and X-34\nPrior to the issuance of the formal Cooperative Agreement Notice, NASA \nMarshall presented an X-33 and X-34 overview briefing on October 19, 1994. \nIt was shared with industry representatives from Aerojet, Allied Signal, Fiber \nMaterial, Martin Marietta Aerospace Division, McDonnell Douglas (MD-\nD), Pratt & Whitney (P&W), Pennsylvania State University, Rocketdyne, \nRockwell International (RI), and Refractory Composites Inc. The briefing \nreviewed the program objectives; potential X-34 attributes; launch vehicle \nperspectives; NASA funding; program assumptions; and the cooperative agree\xad\nment definition, features, notices, and schedule. \nThe briefing identified the following X-34 RSB program objectives: \n1.\t Stimulate the development of a reusable commercial \nlaunch capability for low-Earth orbit payloads that would \nsignificantly reduce costs. \n2.\t Demonstrate technologies applicable to future launch \nvehicles, including design, follow-on use of the vehicle as \na test bed, and low-operating costs with rapid turnaround. \n3.\t Demonstrate that an industry-led industry-Government \npartnership can accomplish the previous objectives within \n30 to 36 months and within a fixed Government budget. \n4.\t Start the test flights in mid-1997, demonstrate orbital \ndelivery capability in early 1998, and conduct two special \nNASA missions in late 1998 and early 1999.8\nThe desired and/or potential attributes of the X-34 RSB as presented are \nshown in Table 3.1.9', 'Chapter 11:\u2002 A New Age of Entrepreneurial Space Operations\n209\nspace access. Indeed, 1996 marked something of a milestone in this history. In \nthat year, worldwide commercial revenues in space for the first time surpassed \nall governmental spending on space, totaling some $77 billion. This growth \ncontinued in 1997, with 75 commercial payloads lofted into orbit, and with \napproximately 75 more military and scientific satellites launched. This repre\xad\nsented a threefold increase over the number the year before. Market surveys for \nthe period thereafter suggested that commercial launches would multiply for the \nnext several years at least: one estimate holding that 1,200 telecommunications \nsatellites would be launched between 1998 and 2007. In that context, many \nspace launch advocates believed that the market had matured sufficiently that \ngovernment investment in launch vehicle development was no longer necessary. \nInstead, they asked that the federal government simply “get out of the way” and \nallow the private sector to pursue development free from bureaucratic\xa0controls.\nThis modern “Gold Rush” sparked several new corporations to muscle their \nway into the tight conglomerate of launch vehicle companies. One of the farthest \nalong and best financed of this new breed was Kistler Aerospace Corporation, \nbased in Kirkland, Washington. Seeking low-cost access to space, Kistler \nemployed Russian-built engines as a centerpiece of its K-1 reusable launcher. \nIt was intended to deliver up to 10,000 pounds to orbit, depending on inclina\xad\ntion. The first stage of this vehicle would fly back to the launch site; the second \nwould orbit Earth before returning. Both stages would descend by parachute \nand land on inflatable air bags. Pioneer, Inc., also emerged, championing the \nPathfinder spaceplane that could accommodate a crew of two and deliver a pay\xad\nload of 5,000 pounds to orbit. Kelly Space and Technology, Inc., worked on its \nAstroliner, a reusable spaceplane that could deliver 11,000 pounds to low-Earth \norbit for a cost of $2,000 per pound. Among these companies, the most inter\xad\nesting concept was Roton by the Rotary Rocket Company. Roton was intended \nas a fully reusable, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) space vehicle with a helicopter \nlanding system designed to transport up to 7,000 pounds to and from space. \nRoton sought to enter commercial service in the year 2000 with a target price \nper flight of $7 million ($1,000 per pound).\nOther space launch firms experimented with unique launch approaches. The \nSea Launch Company LLC used a floating mobile platform that could handle \nlaunches of heavy vehicles out of its Long Beach, California, facilities. This \nlaunch method reduced legal, operational, and infrastructure costs. Since it was \nmobile it offered equatorial launches in any inclination from a single launch \npad, providing maximum efficiency from the launcher. Established as a part\xad\nnership between Boeing (U.S.), Aker ASA (Norway), RSC-Energia (Russia), \nand SDO Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash (Ukraine), the Sea Launch Company was \norganized on 3 April 1995.

Likewise, both the executive branch of the government, \nthrough the issuance of a White House Policy Space Transportation Directive, \nand the legislative branch, though the holding of congressional hearings and \nbudget allocations to NASA and the Department of Defense, were deeply \ninvolved in the decision-making process. The new policy direction was aimed \ntoward reestablishing the Unites States’ competitiveness in the space launch \nvehicle development and launch area and in transferring much of this activity \nto the U.S. aerospace industry. \nThese developments served as the prelude to NASA’s single-stage-to-orbit \n(SSTO), reusable launch vehicle (RLV) program that included the develop\xad\nment of three technology test bed vehicles.

The Skylon reusable launch vehicle is an unpiloted, reusable spaceplane that is being developed by Reaction Engines Limited in the United Kingdom. According to the company, it is intended to provide reliable, responsive, and cost-effective access to space. The Skylon is designed to be a two-stage-to-orbit vehicle, which means it will use two stages to reach orbit. The first stage will carry the second stage and the payload to a high altitude, and then the second stage will separate and continue to orbit while the first stage returns to Earth for reuse. The Skylon is still in the development phase, and there is no information available about its expected performance or capabilities."
Question: What is the opinion of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics regarding the conservation of helium reserves and the development of airships in America?,"The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics recommends that the Government acquire and seal for future use the best helium-producing gas fields; that such experiments be continued as are involved in the development of an efficient and economical process for the extraction and repurification of helium; and that the Government continue experimental work in connection with the development of airships, and inaugurate without delay the use of airships inflated with helium. With large reserves of helium and the development of types of airships to fully realize the advantages to be derived from the use of helium, America would possess resources and knowledge with which no other nation could successfully compete.

The committee is of the opinion that it would be a serious error at this time to adopt a policy of merely marking time in the development of airships. In the judgment of the committee, the time has come to decide to do one of two things, viz, either to carry on with the development of airships or to stop altogether. The development of rigid airships in America for military and naval purposes has, by joint agreement between the War and Navy Departments, been entrusted to the Navy. The question of continuing their development, however, is not altogether a war problem, for airships of all types have probable applications also for commercial purposes. The question, therefore, whether the Navy should continue developing rigid airships at this time should not be determined solely upon considerations of their probable naval usefulness. The Army is directly concerned and the commercial development of airships in America may be said to be also at stake. The problem is therefore a national one. Viewed as such, the Navy becomes, in a peculiar sense, the agent of the whole people in the development of rigid airships. In the last analysis, however, it is for the Congress to determine America’s policy with regard to continuing the development of airships. As between the two alternatives of carrying on or stopping altogether, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, after careful consideration of the matter, is of the opinion that the development of airships should be continued.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n72\nDocument 5-2 (c), “Helium and Airships,” NACA Annual Report (1921), p. 5.\nHELIUM AND AIRSHIPS\nThe United States has a virtual monopoly of the known sources of supply of \nhelium, and these are limited. Experiments have been conducted by the Bureau of \nMines with a view to the development of methods of production and storage, but \nas yet the problem of storage in large quantities has not been satisfactorily solved. \nBecause the known supply is limited, because it is escaping into the atmosphere \nat an estimated rate sufficient to fill four large airships weekly, and because of \nthe tremendously increased value and safety which the use of helium would give \nto airships, particularly in warfare, it is, in the opinion of the National Advisory \nCommittee for Aeronautics, the very essence of wisdom and prudence to provide \nfor the conservation of large reserves through the acquisition and sealing by the \nGovernment of the best helium-producing fields.

Germany, \nin particular, has demonstrated the practicability of commercial airship passenger \nservice. The French Government has laid out a progressive program of develop\xad\nment. France has two rigid airships of the Zeppelin type, which were acquired from \nGermany through the Reparations Commission. The present French program calls \nfor the early inauguration of a commercial airship line from Marseille or Toulon to \nAlgiers. In Italy, the semirigid type of airship has been developed, both for military \nand commercial purposes.\nAmerica’s first program of airship development contemplated the procuring by \nthe Navy of a rigid airship from England—the ill-fated R-38, known in this coun\xad\ntry as the ZR-2; the procuring by the Army of the Italian semirigid airship Roma; \nand the construction by the Navy at Lakewood[,] N.J., of the first American rigid \nairship, to be known as the ZR-1.\nThe disaster to the ZR-2 in Great Britain before delivery to this country \nthreatened for a time the discontinuance of airship development in America.

The proper develop\xad\nment of this type of aircraft for military purposes will unquestionably lead to the \ndevelopment of commercial types, but it is felt that the Government must take the \nlead by first developing rigid airships for military purposes.\nThe committee at that time submitted a special report to the President recom\xad\nmending that adequate provision be made in the then pending naval appropriation \nbill for the construction of rigid airships and suitable hangars, and that a con\xad\ntinuing building program for this type of aircraft be authorized, extending over a \nperiod of years.

In letters to the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the \nSecretary of the Interior, the committee stated that it is necessary to encourage the \neconomical production of helium in order that an increased demand may bring \nabout a greater increase in the supply, a simplification of the processes of extrac\xad\ntion, and a lessening of the cost of production. The committee especially invited \ntheir attention to the necessity for thoroughly investigating all sources from which \nhelium may be extracted or secured, and recommended that every practicable effort \nbe made both to increase production and to decrease cost, having due regard for \nconservation of the sources of supply for military purposes.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n76\nDocument 5-2 (h), “The Airship Problem,” NACA Annual Report (1925), p. 58.\nTHE AIRSHIP PROBLEM\nAirships are of three types: Rigid, semirigid, and nonrigid. The value of air\xad\nships for military or commercial purposes has not as yet been conclusively demon\xad\nstrated. It can not be said, however, that they are without value, nor that they have \nno further possibilities than have already been demonstrated. The fact of the matter \nis that all types of airships are in the experimental stage of development. The recent \nregrettable loss of the rigid airship Shenandoah has been urged as a reason for the \nGovernment’s abandoning airship development, or at least rigid airship develop\xad\nment, on the theory that rigid airships never will be practicable.\nThe committee fully appreciates the seriousness of the airship situation and \nbelieves that despite all that has been done in many countries to develop airships, \nthey are still rather delicate structures. The conclusions of the naval court of inquiry \nas to the causes for the destruction of the Shenandoah have not yet been made pub\xad\nlic.

The committee renews its recommendations then made, that \nthe development of airships be continued, and that sufficient funds be provided \nfor experimental work for the[] obtaining of definite information regarding the \nstrength qualities of materials and girders used in the construction of airships, \nand for the development and checking of the theories used in the general design \nof\xa0airships.\nAs the technique of airship construction has not as yet been developed in this \ncountry, the committee believes it advisable, in the interests of rapid and economi\xad\ncal progress, that the Government procure a rigid type of airship, either of German \nor British manufacture, embodying the latest developments, as far as possible, of \nboth countries. Such an airship is an indispensable part of our program, and should \nbe obtained to fill the vacancy caused by the loss of the ZR-2. The committee also \nrenews its recommendation that the present program for the construction of the \nZR-1 at Lakewood, N.J., be prosecuted with renewed vigor.\nDocument 5-2 (e), “Helium for Airships,” NACA Annual Report (1921), p. 22.\nHELIUM FOR AIRSHIPS\nHelium, next to hydrogen, is the lightest gas known. It has 92 percent of the \nlifting power of hydrogen and for military purposes possesses an inestimable advan\xad\ntage over hydrogen in that it is nonflammable. The natural-gas wells in the United \nStates afford a practical monopoly of the known sources of supply. According to \nthe latest estimates, helium is escaping into the atmosphere at the rate of one and \na quarter million cubic feet a day, or at a rate sufficient to fill four large airships a \nweek. At this rate, according to our present knowledge of helium-bearing gas, our \ngreat resources will have become dissipated within the next 20 years unless some \nappropriate measures are taken to preserve the sources of supply.\nThe refrigeration process is employed to obtain helium. In this process every \nconstituent present in the natural gas is liquefied except helium, which is expelled \ninto suitable containers for storage. The application of this process to the extraction \nof helium has not been perfected, but the line of development is reasonably clear. \nThe Army, the Navy, and the Bureau of Mines, acting in close cooperation (with \nthe limited funds available), are carrying out certain developments which promise \nto solve the production problem.\nThe Bureau of Mines is also conducting experiments to determine whether \nunderground-chamber storage is practicable and economical. If so, the problem']","
The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) believes that it is wise and prudent to conserve large reserves of helium through the acquisition and sealing by the Government of the best helium-producing fields. This is due to the limited supply of helium, its escape into the atmosphere at a significant rate, and the increased value and safety it would provide to airships, particularly in warfare. NACA also thinks that attention should be given to the development of types of airships to fully utilize the advantages of helium. Such development would give America advantages, for purposes either of war or commerce, with which no other nation could successfully compete."
How did CFD help in the redesign of the wing for the HiMAT flight test vehicle and the retrofitting of the engines on the Boeing 737?,"CFD techniques played a significant role in the redesign of the wing for the HiMAT flight test vehicle, a 1/3 scale model of a fighter plane used to test new aerodynamic and control concepts. By using data from CFD studies, Boeing engineers were able to design the new fanjets for much greater efficiency, making it one of the most successful passenger airliners in history. However, in the context of the given text, it is also important to note that for the immediate future development of flying boats, basic improvements are necessary beyond size alone. The studies presented in the text suggest that marked improvement in flying boat performance is possible through deviating from established conventional design practice, improving hull form and means of hydrodynamic sustention, and conducting a thorough research program to establish basic design information on hydrofoils of both high and low aspect ratio, the Ventnor principle, and high length-beam ratios.","['NACA to NASA to Now\n182\nhad been so complex and time-consuming that aerodynamicists had great \ndifficulty applying them efficiently to aircraft design. Engineers using linear \nequations—two-dimensional (2D)—could go only so far. The solving of many \nvariables using multiple equations concurrently required greater computational \npower than was available in the predigital age. \nEngineers at Ames Research Center had long been working to streamline \nthe process of resolving the problem of Navier-Stokes equations. An early key \nfigure at Ames was Harvard Lomax, who started experimenting with electronic \ncomputers from the late 1950s into the 1970s, using them to model the behav\xad\nior of blunt-body objects. By 1976, the possibilities of CFD had progressed suf\xad\nficiently for Ames Research Center Director Hans Mark to set up a group under \nengineer F. Ronald Bailey to advance the concept. Using the most powerful \ncomputers available—at the time the Cray-1 supercomputer—Ames research\xad\ners began to break down the equations into usable subparts and establish meth\xad\nodologies for resolving multiple variables concurrently. Three years later Ames \nformed the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator (NAS) Projects Office with \nthe specific objective of advancing CFD capabilities. Later, Ames also put a \nCray X-MP and a Cray-2 to use for CFD analysis. Research activities at other \nNASA Centers also helped to transform the entire field. During this process the \nILLIAC IV became the first massively parallel computer; it found significant \nuse in advancing CFD capabilities at Ames Research Center and elsewhere. \nSome friction quickly emerged between traditionalists who had a strong \ncommitment to wind tunnel testing and the emerging capabilities of com\xad\nputational fluid dynamics. Early on, NASA’s “tunnel rats” resented the rising \namount of funding invested in CFD research, money that they believed could \nbe effectively used for wind tunnel work. Only with efforts to make sure that \nequitable funding existed—and with the training of wind tunnel personnel in \nCFD techniques—did this begin to change. Over time, it became obvious that \nCFD provided great capabilities to resolve Navier-Stokes equations, but that \nwind tunnels were necessary to validate CFD findings. Always, users found \nthat for all the great capabilities of CFD, at some point there also has to be \ndemonstration of solutions in the real world. Wind tunnels, often exceedingly \nsmall ones that used tiny models, were ideal for that purpose.\nCFD began to pay off in the late 1970s, with the successful redesign of the \nwing for the HiMAT (Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology) flight test \nvehicle, a 1/3 scale model of a fighter plane used to test new aerodynamic and \ncontrol concepts. CFD techniques were also key to the successful retrofitting of \nthe engines on the Boeing 737, making it one of the most successful passenger \nairliners in history. Using data from CFD studies, Boeing engineers were able to \ndesign the new fanjets for the engines for much greater efficiency.', 'Transiting to a New Century, 1990–2008\n177\nadvanced design analysis capabilities. NASA worked to gain a broader under\xad\nstanding of durability, modeling, high-temperature materials and structures, \nincreased fuel economy, and the reduction of emissions and noise. NASA’s \nSmall Engine Component Test Facility (SECTF), located in Glenn’s Engine \nResearch Building (ERB), which opened in 1992, was the main test facility \nfor the IHPTET. The SECTF consisted of two individual cells dedicated to \ncompressors and turbines. Both replicated the operating conditions of an actual \nengine over a broad range of speeds and temperatures.\nSecond, NASA utilized its long history in the development of advanced \nmaterials, like polymer matrix composites, superalloys, structural ceramics, \nceramic matrix composites, and thermal barrier coatings, that led to lighter, \nstronger, and better engine components capable of operating in high tem\xad\nperatures. Those NASA-innovated materials easily crossed over into the new \ntechnology going into military jet engines.36\nFinally, Glenn’s expertise in CFD code design led to the Center’s assuming \nthe leadership of IHPTET’s CFD technology development panel. The use of \ncomputer codes led to NASA’s taking the lead in innovating new and effec\xad\ntive tools for the component design, evaluation, and operational analysis of \nhigh-performance jet engines.37 Researchers used the NASA Average-Passage \nturbomachinery flow analysis code called “APNASA” to optimize the per\xad\nformance of a composite, forward-swept, shrouded fan. Created at Glenn by \nJohn Adamczyk in 1985, APNASA enabled the prediction of the interaction \nbetween stationary and rotating parts of multistage components such as the fan, \ncompressor, and turbine.38 They also used the 3D Combustor Simulation Code \nto model liquid spray droplet fuel injection for improved combustor\xa0designs.39\nGlenn’s hallmark Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) allowed \nthe complete modeling of a running engine throughout a simulated flight. \nInitiated in 1994, NPSS served as a “virtual wind tunnel” that enabled engi\xad\nneers to explore multiple design options simultaneously in terms of perfor\xad\nmance, affordability, stability, operational life, and certification requirements. \nThose options centered on fluid mechanics, heat transfer, combustion, structural \nmechanics, materials, controls, manufacturing, and overall economics. The core \nof the system contained three main elements: engineering application models and \ntwo kinds of system software, for the simulation and high-performance comput\xad\ning environments respectively. With NPSS, designers did not have to resort to \ncostly and time-consuming physical construction and tests of jet engines. The \nNASA/Industry Cooperative Effort agreement partnered Glenn with the Air \nForce’s aerospace engineering organizations and universities with GE, Pratt & \nWhitney, Boeing, Honeywell, Rolls-Royce, Williams International, and Teledyne \nContinental to develop NPSS for both military and commercial engines.40', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n430\nDocument 5-27 (k), Excerpts from Annual Report \nof the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics \n(Washington, DC), 1946–57, “Seaplanes,” Annual Report (1955), pp. 23–24.\nHYDRODYNAMIC ELEMENTS\nRecent developments in water-based aircraft have resulted in configurations \nutilizing planing surfaces operating in ranges of trim, length-beam ratio, and \nFroude number beyond those for which most of the available planing theories were \ncorrelated with experimental data. The existing theories for a rectangular flat plate \nin pure planing have therefore been correlated with existing data, including recent \nunpublished data. These results, published in Technical Note 3233, indicate the \nneed for a rational theory that will agree with data in the recently extended ranges. \nA theory based on the consideration of linear lifting-line theory, the suction com\xad\nponent of lift, and crossflow effects is presented. The agreement between the pro\xad\nposed theory and experimental data was found to be satisfactory for engineering \ncalculations of pure-planing rectangular flat-plate lift and center of pressure.\nAs a continuing part of the NACA research program to provide data needed for \nthe application of hydroskis to water-based aircraft, the force characteristics of an \naspect-ratio-0.125 flat plate operating submerged beneath the water surface at sev\xad\neral depths have been determined. These data are reported in Technical Note 3249 \nwhere they are compared with similar data from flat plates having aspect ratios of \n1.00 and 0.25 and also with various aerodynamic theories. The comparisons indi\xad\ncate that decreasing either the aspect ratio or the depth of submersion decreased the \nlift coefficient, drag coefficient, and lift-drag ratio. The center of pressure moved \nrearward with decreasing aspect ratio. Cavitation at the leading edge caused a \ngradual decrease in lift coefficient and a gradual increase in drag coefficient. The \nplaning-bubble type of high-angle separation caused sharp decreases in lift, drag, \nand moment coefficients. The ventilation boundaries defining the start of the high-\nangle separation moved to higher speeds and higher angles as the aspect ratio was \ndecreased. A theory obtained by modifying Falkner’s vortex-lattice theory, which \nhad shown good agreement at all angles for aspect ratios of 1.00 and 0.25, also \nagreed with the data for the aspect-ratio-0.125 plate except at angles above 16° \nwhere the predicted lift proved too high.\nThe data for the three submerged rectangular flat plates having aspect ratios of \n1.00, 0.25, and 0.125 were obtained with the plates mounted on a single strut. The \nmutual interference effects of the flat plates and the strut and the strut tares have \nbeen evaluated experimentally and the results are given in Technical Note 3420. \nThe interference effects of the strut on the lifting surface proved negligible at all \ndepths of submergence for drag and at all but the very shallow depths for lift and \npitching moment. At the very shallow depths the interference effects caused slight \nincreases in both lift and pitching moment. Strut-tare effects on lift and pitching', '649\nDocument 5-43 (a–m)\ndesign studies of directional trim and control response at low forward speeds can \nbe conveniently made. The use of the charts and equations for tail-rotor design \nstudies is illustrated, and comparisons between theoretical and experimental results \nare\xa0presented.\nHelicopter fuselages in general, and tandem fuselages in particular, may exert \na marked influence on helicopter directional stability and control. An experimental \ninvestigation was therefore made in the Langley stability tunnel to determine the \ndirectional stability of two tandem helicopter fuselages (Technical Note 3201). One \nfuselage represented a helicopter with overlapping rotors (overlap-type fuselage) \nand the other a helicopter with non-overlapping rotors (non-overlap-type fuselage). \nThe overlap-type fuselage model was found to be directionally unstable for cer\xad\ntain combinations of angle of attack and sideslip, but could be made directionally \nstable by blunting the vertical tail of the model or by using a thin tail in place of \nthe original thick vertical tail. The non-overlap-type fuselage model was direction\xad\nally unstable for positive angles of attack throughout the angle-of-slideslip range. \nSpoilers located around the fuselage nose were the only effective means found to \nmake this fuselage stable without resorting to major design changes.\nAIRFOIL CHARACTERISTICS\nExtension of the range of information on airfoil-section characteristics has \nbeen continued to meet the specialized requirements of rotating-wing aircraft. \nThe increasing speed of helicopters, for example, has brought about the need for \nairfoil data at high subsonic Mach numbers at angles of attack as high as 30°. \nData in this range were obtained in an investigation in the Langley low-turbulence \npressure tunnel of four airfoil sections varying in thickness from 6 to 12 percent. \nInformation which illustrates the effects of airfoil-section parameters and flow vari\xad\nables on the aerodynamic characteristics of symmetrical, two-dimensional airfoils \nat high angles of attack, obtained from the literature and recent investigations, is \nsummarized in Technical Note 3241. Included in this summary are the results of \nan investigation of one section, through an angle-of-attack range from 0° to 360°, \nwhich show that the drag coefficient reaches a value of 2 at an angle of attack of 90°.\nIn an effort to develop a helicopter rotor having minimum profile-power losses, \nthe NACA has derived a special series of helicopter airfoil sections. The most prom\xad\nising of such sections (NACA 8-H-12) is a laminar-flow airfoil which, when tested \nin the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnel[,] showed low drag in the \noperating lift-coefficient range of most helicopter rotors without undue sacrifice \nin maximum section lift coefficient. The airfoil retained reasonable aerodynamic \ncharacteristics when tested in the rough condition. The practical aspects of blade \nconstruction, however, created doubt as to the achievement, in actual operation, of \nthe low drag values obtained from the aerodynamically smooth, two-dimensional \ntest specimens.

Question: What was the primary goal of the Mariner 9 mission and what significant discoveries were made during its operation?,"The primary goal of the Mariner 9 mission was to map about 70% of the surface of Mars during the first three months of operation. The spacecraft was launched on May 30, 1971, and entered orbit around Mars on November 14, 1971. During its operation, Mariner 9 returned spectacular photos of the deeply pitted Martian landscape, for the first time showing such features as the great system of parallel rilles stretching more than 1,700 kilometers across Mare Sirenum. The spacecraft also identified about 20 volcanoes, one of which, later named Olympus Mons, dwarfed any similar feature on Earth. Based on data from Mariner 9’s spectrometers, it was determined that Olympus Mons, part of Nix Olympica—a “great volcanic pile” possibly formed by the eruption of hot magma from the planet’s interior—is about 15–30 kilometers tall and has a base with a diameter of 600 kilometers. The vast amount of incoming data countered the notion that Mars was geologically inert. There was some speculation on the possibility of water having existed on the surface during an earlier period, but the spacecraft data could not provide any conclusive proof.

In addition to its primary goal, the Mariner 9 mission also included the Dust Flux Monitor Subsystem, which included two quartz piezoelectric acoustic sensors and the dedicated Dust Flux Monitor Instrument. The sensor unit of the Dust Flux Monitor Instrument was based on a special polarized plastic dust sensor developed in the laboratory of John Simpson in Chicago, and it was mounted on Stardust’s Whipple shield to measure oncoming particles. The instrument could measure the flux of interplanetary dust encountered throughout the mission, providing data for multiple purposes, including protecting the spacecraft from the high flux of particles in the coma, understanding spacecraft anomalies, measuring the impact rate and mass distribution of particles during the spacecraft’s encounter with the comet, and providing context for the collected dust samples.

The Mariner 9 mission was a significant success, providing valuable data on the Martian surface and atmosphere, as well as contributing to our understanding of interplanetary dust.","['103\n1971\u2003\nradiation.

Unlike Mariner IV, however, Mariner \nV did not carry an imaging instrument. Initially, \nNASA had planned to send Mariner V on a flyby at \na miss distance of 8,165 kilometers to the surface, \nbut the Agency altered its plan in favor of a more \nmodest 75,000-kilometer flyby in order to preclude \nthe non-sterilized vehicle from crashing into the \nplanet. After a mid-course correction on 19 June, \nMariner V began transmitting data on Venus on \n19\xa0October during its encounter. Closest approach \nwas at 17:34:56 UT at a range of 4,094 kilome\xad\nters, much closer than expected due to the course \ncorrection. Mariner V found that although Venus \ndoes not have a magnetic field, the dense daylight \nionosphere produces a bow shock that deflects \nthe solar wind around the planet. The ultraviolet \nphotometer detected a hydrogen corona (as found \nby the Soviet Venera 4) but no oxygen emission. \nMariner V’s instruments indicated that the planet’s \nsurface temperature and pressure were 527°C and \n75 to 100 atmospheres, respectively—which coun\xad\ntered the Soviet claim that its Venera 4 spacecraft \nhad managed to transmit from the planet’s surface. \nThe encounter with Venus deflected the spacecraft \ntowards the Sun, and Mariner V entered solar orbit \nwith parameters ranging from 0.579 AU and 0.735 \nAU.

In-flight science was limited largely to images collected by the Optical Navigation \nCamera (NavCam); dust flux and size measurements taken by the Dust Flux Monitor \nInstrument; and in situ analyses of particle composition using the Cometary and \nInterstellar Dust Analyzer (CIDA) instrument.\nNavCam was a modified version of a Voyager Wide Field and Planetary Camera and \nfeatured a 1024 × 1024 charge-coupled device detector built originally for the Cassini \nImaging Science Subsystem with digital electronics modified from the Clementine \nspacecraft. The camera optics used a Voyager Wide Angle Optical Assembly with a \n200-millimeter focal length lens. The filter wheel and shutter were also Voyager spares. \nStardust added a scan mirror mechanism to vary its available viewing angles (this \ndesign had heritage from Mars Pathfinder) and a new periscope to protect the scanning \nmirror in the coma’s dust particle storm. The images would have a resolution of 59.4 \nmicroradians (mrad) per pixel—an order of magnitude better than Giotto’s images \nof Comet Halley. Co-investigator Ray Newburn of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was \nresponsible for the imaging science from this camera.108\nAny spacecraft flying so close to a comet would necessarily encounter a great deal \nof dust. To study this phenomenon, the spacecraft’s Dust Flux Monitor Subsystem \nincluded two quartz piezoelectric acoustic sensors, which were called, collectively, the \nDual Acoustic Sensor System; as well as the dedicated Dust Flux Monitor Instrument, \nitself a copy of the High Rate Detector element of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument \nused on Cassini. The sensor unit of the 1.7-kilogram Dust Flux Monitor Instrument—a \nhighly sensitive instrument designed to detect particles as small as a few microns—was \nbased on a special polarized plastic dust sensor developed in the laboratory of John \nSimpson in Chicago, and it was mounted on Stardust’s Whipple shield to measure \noncoming particles. Because the instrument could measure the flux of interplanetary \ndust encountered throughout the mission, its data could be employed for multiple \npurposes: to protect the spacecraft from the high flux of particles in the coma, to \nunderstand spacecraft anomalies, to measure the impact rate and mass distribution \nof particles during the spacecraft’s encounter with the comet, and to provide context \nfor the collected dust samples.109\nAnthony Tuzzolino of the University of Chicago, the instrument lead, was no stranger \nto spaceflight, having contributed his expertise to 35 space missions, including the dust \n108 \t\nNewburn, R.

The primary goal of the Mariner 9 mission was to map about 70% of the surface during the first three months of operation. During its operation, Mariner 9 made several significant discoveries. It identified about 20 volcanoes, one of which, later named Olympus Mons, dwarfed any similar feature on Earth. Based on data from Mariner 9’s spectrometers, it was determined that Olympus Mons is about 15-30 kilometers tall and has a base with a diameter of 600 kilometers. Another major surface feature identified was Valles Marineris, a system of canyons east of the Tharsis region that is more than 4,000 kilometers long, 200 kilometers wide, and in some areas, up to 7 kilometers deep. The spacecraft also returned spectacular photos of the deeply pitted Martian landscape, for the first time showing such features as the great system of parallel rilles stretching more than 1,700 kilometers across Mare Sirenum. The vast amount of incoming data countered the notion that Mars was geologically inert. There was some speculation on the possibility of water having existed on the surface during an earlier period, but the spacecraft data could not provide any conclusive proof."
"Question: What is the support unloading compensator and how is it used in the medical field, particularly in stroke rehabilitation and cerebral palsy treatment?","The support unloading compensator is a device that stimulates the support zones of the foot in natural human gait, and it has been developed by the Center for Aerospace Medicine (CAM) in Russia to correct motor disturbances in weightlessness. However, its clinical application has opened the possibility of early diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders on Earth. In the medical field, the device has been used in the most acute phase of stroke and facilitates more significant regression of motor disturbances and earlier recovery of locomotion than traditional treatment methods. The device has also been used in the integrated rehabilitation of cerebral palsy patients, maximizing restoration of the balance of strength between extensor and flexor muscles, particularly in an upright position, and normalizing the functions of standing and walking, as well as coordination control of various classes of movements.

The support unloading compensator has been used in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy, leading to a reduction in edema by 17% to 20% and an increase in the range of motion in the ankle joint by 45% as early as the first 72 hours after surgery. The device has also been used in the treatment of patients who have suffered from stroke or brain trauma, leading to faster and less-expensive diagnoses and treatment of patients suffering from vertigo, dizziness, and equilibrium disturbances.

The development of the support unloading compensator has also led to the creation of a method that uses computerized systems to accurately assess the state of vestibular function, intersensory interactions, spatial orientation, and visual tracking. This method has been used in a series of scientific experiments before, during, and after spaceflights on the Salyut-6, Salyut-7, MIR, and ISS to evaluate the disruptions that occur in various forms of eye movements and to find the causes of these disturbances.

In space, information received from the vestibular apparatus within the inner ear does not align with information received from other sensory systems, leading to the development of space motion sickness. The use of a special test battery makes it possible to evaluate the disruptions that are occurring in various forms of eye movements and to find the causes of these disturbances.

Diseases of the central nervous \nsystem, brain injuries of various types, long-term \nmotor unloading in aging, as well as some specific \noccupational conditions are also accompanied by \nthe development of the aforementioned changes. \nBased on these data, IBMP scientists are working \njointly with commercial companies to introduce motor \ndisturbances corrective measures that were developed \nfor weightlessness into the practice of treating and \nrehabilitating patients with profound motor lesions that \nare due to cerebral palsy, stroke, and brain and spinal \ncord injuries.\nBetween 2005 and 2011, the Center for Aerospace \nMedicine developed a clinical version of the support \nunloading compensator—the Korvit—and obtained \nall approval documents and licenses.\nToday, this technology is being used in the most \nacute phase of stroke and facilitates more significant \nregression of motor disturbances and earlier recovery \nof locomotion than traditional treatment methods.

Assessment of eye movement reactions of cosmonauts, preflight and postflight, has led to \nfaster and less-expensive diagnoses and treatment of patients suffering from vertigo, dizziness and \nequilibrium disturbances. A patented computerized, non-pharmacological method of preventing and \ncorrecting unfavorable perception and sensorimotor reactions is used to train patients and astronauts \nto acquire the ability to suppress vertigo, dizziness and equilibrium disturbances.\nA system of hardware and software that collects information on body movements of astronauts on the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) has led to motor imagery protocols used in the research environment \nof a hospital in Rome in treatment of adult stroke patients and children with cerebral palsy. Other body \nmovement research on the ISS led to the development of a suit for astronauts to compensate for the \nlack of daily loading from gravity. The clinical version of this suit is used for the comprehensive and \ndrug-free treatment of cerebral palsy in children in Russia. Another clinical variation of this suit is \nused on patients who have suffered from stroke or brain trauma.\nNew Technology Simulates Microgravity \nand Improves Balance on Earth\nSpaceflight opportunities, such as that of the ISS, \nfacilitated the development of Earth-based models \nof weightlessness and opened the door to studying \nthe effects of the elimination of gravity. Over the \n20 years since the ISS came into existence, the \nRussian Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) \nhas compiled a large amount of data—information \nand facts that have made it possible to switch from \ndescribing occurrences and phenomena to developing \ntheories about the role and place of gravitational \nmechanisms in various bodily systems.\nOne example of an evolution in the development \nof new knowledge is the discovery of the leading \ntriggering role in maintaining vertical posture of sensory \norgans called Vater-Paccini corpuscles, which are \nlocated in the soles of the feet. These receptors were \ndiscovered back in the 19th century; however, their \nrole in gravireception was established recently, thanks \nto ground-based simulation studies designed to \nkeep cosmonauts’ balance healthy in long-duration \nspaceflights. As a result of these studies, a unique \npiece of technology was developed to help to correct \nthe motor disturbances in individuals with central \nnervous system dysfunction, injuries, balance \nproblems and motor decline due to aging.\nGround-based studies at IBMP identified a particular \npattern of stabilization between body loading on the \nsoles of the feet and subsequent motor stabilization \nprocesses associated with brain and spinal cord \nactivities. The knowledge obtained revealed that \nthe development of sensory-motor disturbances may \nbe prevented by means of “artificial” support stimuli \napplied to the bottoms of the feet. The research \nresults led to the development of new technology, \nthe “support unloading compensator,” which is a \ndevice that stimulates the support zones of the foot \nin natural human gait.\nToday, this technology is being \nused in the most acute phase \nof stroke and facilitates more \nsignificant regression of motor \ndisturbances and earlier recovery \nof locomotion than traditional \ntreatment methods. \nThe uniqueness of this device lies in its ability to \nsimulate the physical parameters that the support \nreceptor or the foot receives during walking: the \nmagnitude of pressure, temporal characteristics, \nduration of impact, intervals between stimulation', '158\nchanges typical of acute gravitational unloading are \nreproduced in the body.\nThe potential use of the system for health purposes \nrelates to the specific physiological changes in the \nbody caused by gravitational unloading. In particular, \nacute disruptions occur in the mechanisms of sensory \ninteraction. These disruptions counteract compensatory \nprocesses in the central nervous system, thus resulting \nin discovery of latent neurological disruptions. Treatment \nwith dry immersion is also accompanied by a number \nof physiological shifts, such as the redistribution of \nfluids in the body, which have positive effects in certain \ncardiovascular conditions such as edema.\nThe drug-free method of dry immersion offers the \nuser the following: relaxation of muscles; increase \nin immunity; elimination of edema; and, normalization \nof blood pressure, thus making it possible to use the \nimmersion system for the early diagnosis of slow-\ndeveloping neurological disorders and to combat \nmassive edema that responds poorly to \npharmacological remedies.\nThe use of dry immersion may also be an effective \nmechanism for rehabilitative treatment in areas such \nas psychoneurology, traumatology, orthopedics \n(post-operative rehabilitation), sports medicine, clinical \nneurophysiology and applied psycho-physiology.\nThe use of the immersion system is also a particularly \nvaluable rehabilitation measure for premature babies \nwho are exposed to the effects of gravity following \nthe intrauterine environment. Perinatal damage to \nthe central nervous system (i.e., hyperexcitability; \ndepressive, muscle hypertonia, and cephalohematoma \nsyndromes) is an opportunity for the use of the dry \nimmersion method. Additional uses for dry immersion \ninclude the treatment of immune disorders, hormone \nimbalances, muscle disease, wound healing and \ncardiovascular health.\nThe spectrum of possible applications of this system \nthat simulates spaceflight conditions, such as those \nexperienced by the ISS, is fairly broad and will expand \nwith further study.\nDry immersion complex. \nImage credit: Institute of Biomedical \nProblems, Russia\nNew prototype of the automated immersion \nsystem used in clinics.\nImage credit: Aerospace Medical Center \nand Technology', '177\nThe effectiveness of the non-pharmacological \ncomputerized method has made it a good candidate \nfor use both during the preflight training of ISS crew \nmembers, and during spaceflight, to suppress the \nsymptoms of space motion sickness. The suppression \nof negative reactions during flight using the fixation \nreflex has been successfully applied by crew members \naboard the ISS since 2013.\nMoreover, recent studies (2017-2018) in patients with \nParkinson’s disease, and carried out in the Research \nCenter of Neurology, Moscow, have shown that such \nan approach using of the OculoStim-CM hardware \nand a special battery of computerized tests allow us \nto solve the problem of objectifying the neurological \ndeficit and assess the disorders in trajectories of head \nand eyes movements. Early diagnosis and properly \ninitiated treatment play an important role in stabilizing \nthe progression of Parkinson’s disease. Computerized \nmethods and OculoStim-CM hardware were originally \ndeveloped for space research. However, their clinical \napplication now opens the possibility of early diagnosis \nof disorders in Parkinson’s disease, assessing the \ndynamics of these disorders and, in the future, \nproceeding to the screening assessment of these \ndisorders in patients at risk when conventional \ndiagnostic methods are ineffective.\nSpace Technologies in Rehabilitation \nPractice\nThe increase in the duration of a crewed spaceflight \nhas resulted in the need to improve the system of \nmedical support and monitor the health status of \ncosmonauts. Traditional means and methods such as \nphysical exercise are impossible to perform, in some \ncases, due to a time deficit limited vehicle space, etc. \nIn preparation for longer spaceflights, specialists from \nIBMP and the company Zvezda developed the axial \nloading suit, Penguin, as the space device that could \ncompensate for the deficit of axial loading of the body \nonboard the spacecraft.\nThe idea to load the musculoskeletal system of \nthe cosmonaut by using a preventive load suit, \nwhich creates a constant load on the skeleton, leg \nmuscles and torso, resulted in a dynamic proprioceptive \ncorrection method. This suit was applied in health care \nfor the treatment of children with cerebral palsy, thereby \nshortening the time needed to develop walking skills.\nThe search for methods of restorative treatment for \npatients with ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury \nended with the development of a modified version of \nPenguin. This therapeutic suit is called Regent.\nToday, a wide range of experience \nhas been accumulated in the \napplication of Regent in patients \nwith focal defeats of the central \nnervous system. \nToday, a wide range of experience has been \naccumulated in the application of Regent in patients \nwith focal defects of the central nervous system. \nA total of 112 clinics, which provide specialized \npreventive, curative and rehabilitation assistance \nin the Russian Federation, use this technology in \nrehabilitation practice.\nLeft: The Adeli treatment suit in use for pediatric \nrehabilitation.

This portable method could \nbe easily implemented in space and potentially used \nto stimulate muscle contractions to counteract lower \nextremity dysfunction on long-duration space missions. \nThis research is improving our understanding of how \nthe brain reacts to and behaves during spaceﬂight. \nThis is a crucial step in the development of appropriate \ncountermeasures to enable safe and successful \nexploration missions in the future, especially when \nconsidering critical crew tasks such as spacewalks \nor surface-based extravehicular activity, which could \nbe hampered by impaired motor control, movement \nand coordination. Higher cognitive tasks (e.g., working \nmemory, risk-taking and dual-tasking) might also be \ninﬂuenced, possibly leading to unacceptable risks \nand hazards. Research in this area will also help to \ndetermine any potential long-term effects of such \nadaptation in space and on return to Earth, and \nto feed into associated recovery and rehabilitation \nplanning. Additionally, research findings may have direct \nand indirect clinical impacts and could be transferred \nto multiple neurological and psychiatric diseases and \npathologies on Earth, such as patients suffering from \nneurodegenerative disorders or vestibular problems, \nas well as members of the elderly population who \nmay be coping with multisensory deficit syndromes, \nimmobilization and inactivity.\nNew Way to Assess Neurovestibular \nSystem Health in Space Also Benefits \nThose on Earth\nAmong the many problems that have confronted the \nmedical sciences since humans first began exploring \nspace, a main one is adaptation to the conditions \nof changed gravitational force. Upon arrival in \nweightlessness (the first 3 to 7 days) and upon \nthe return to Earth (from landing to 3 to 5 days later), \nvirtually all crew members experience a number \nof negative reactions and sensory disorders (e.g., \norientation illusions, vertigo, dizziness, problems \nfocusing on and tracking visual objects), which are \nperceived as uncomfortable and can be accompanied \nby space motion sickness.\nIn weightlessness, information received from the \nvestibular apparatus within the inner ear does not \nalign with information received from other sensory \nsystems; therefore, the typical sensory links are broken \nand the brain cannot correctly interpret the incoming \nsignals at the beginning of flight, thereby leading to the \ndevelopment of space motion sickness. As a result, \nthis situation causes a decrease in the quality \nof performance of work tasks, particularly those \nrelating to visual tracking accuracy. It is likely that the \nunsuccessful docking of spacecraft, errors in structural \nassembly, and other instances of errors in manual \ncontrol that have occurred in orbit were often caused \nby disturbances in the function of tracking moving \nspace objects because of changes in sensory functions.\nAnalysis of data that was accumulated in a series of \nscientific experiments before, during and after space-\nflights on the Salyut-6, Salyut-7, MIR and ISS has led \nthe Institute of Biomedical Problems in Russia to \ndevelop a method that uses computerized systems—\nnamed OculoStim-CM, Virtual and Sensomotor—that \ncan accurately assess the state of vestibular function, \nintersensory interactions, spatial orientation, and visual \ntracking (Russian Federation patent #2307575 dated \n10/10/2007, Kornilova L.

The support unloading compensator is a device developed by the Center for Aerospace Medicine. It was initially designed for use in weightlessness to counteract muscle tone and coordination disturbances. However, due to its effectiveness in addressing motor disturbances, it has been adapted for use in the medical field, particularly in stroke rehabilitation and cerebral palsy treatment.

In stroke rehabilitation, the support unloading compensator, also known as the Korvit, is used in the most acute phase of stroke to facilitate more significant regression of motor disturbances and earlier recovery of locomotion than traditional treatment methods. It has also been found to prevent muscle spasticity development in limbs affected by paresis when used in the first hours after the onset of a stroke.

In cerebral palsy treatment, the use of the Korvit apparatus in the integrated rehabilitation of patients has made it possible to maximize restoration of the balance of strength between extensor and flexor muscles, particularly in an upright position, and to normalize the functions of standing and walking, as well as coordination control of various classes of movements.

The support unloading compensator has also been used in children during the early recovery phase after surgical treatment for fractures of the calf bones, facilitating the reduction of edema and an increase in the range of motion in the ankle joint."

What is the Meteor Crater event and what are some of its key characteristics?,"The Meteor Crater event is a collision between a small solar system body and Earth's surface that occurred in 1908 in central Siberia. The event was described as an atmospheric fireball as bright as the Sun, and the terminal height of the explosion was estimated to be 5–12 kilometers. The shock wave was accompanied by a strong blast of highly heated air, and bright nights or prolongations of twilight were reported throughout Eurasia. The impact hypothesis had a terrestrial analog, and at least one near-Earth object was accepted as having left its mark on Earth. The introduction of a mineralogical diagnostic tool, coesite and stishovite, offered the potential to quell debates over ambiguous structures, both on Earth and on the Moon. The Meteor Crater event was also a key event in the history of near-Earth objects research, as it led to the recognition of impact cratering as a geological process and the potential of the cratering process itself to record relative ages.","['31\nCHAPTER 2\nRECOGNIZING IMPACT AS A \nGEOLOGICAL PROCESS\nD\nuring the 20th century, geoscientists gradually came to accept that \nimpacts by small solar system bodies, be they comets or asteroids, could \nalter Earth’s surface. Understanding of how an impact event would rearrange \nthe landscape evolved, too. Early thought had focused on impact mechanics, \nbut the development of powerful explosives, their use in the world wars, and \nthen nuclear weapons testing focused researchers on energy instead. Impact \ncraters came to be understood as the result of explosive processes.\nThe beginnings of space exploration then altered the context of cratering \nresearch. Impact craters were found not just on Earth and its Moon, but on \nMars and, still later, the moons of the other planets too. Cratering was ubiqui\xad\ntous. The creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, and the par\xad\nallel foundation of the United States Geological Survey’s astrogeology branch, \nprovided institutional homes for this research.\nMeteor Crater: An Explosive Event?\nTen years after Gilbert’s investigation of the lunar surface, the feature now \nknown as Meteor Crater came to the attention of Philadelphia lawyer and \nmining engineer Daniel Moreau Barringer, who staked a mining claim at \nthe site after examining the meteoric irons found in the area. Convinced (as \nGilbert had been) that the majority of the iron impactor lay buried somewhere \nbeneath the crater, he enlisted the aid of friend and physicist Benjamin C.', 'Chapter 2: Recognizing Impact as a Geological Process\n39\nBarringer passed away of a heart attack the very next week, his death effec\xad\ntively ending the discussion and most subsequent financial endeavors regard\xad\ning Meteor Crater. By this time, largely through the efforts of Barringer \nhimself, the crater had come to be accepted by many eminent astronomers \nand geologists as the remnant of a collision with an extraterrestrial body—a \nnear-Earth object. Reports of another potential impact structure at Odessa, \nTexas, had already surfaced in 1922 and 1926, and others were soon to fol\xad\nlow.22 At long last, the impact hypothesis had a terrestrial analog, and at least \none near-Earth object was accepted as having left its mark on Earth.\nThe Tunguska Impact Event\nShortly after 7:00 a.m. on 30 June 1908 (00:14 UT), a powerful explosion \noccurred over the basin of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in central \nSiberia. Although contemporary accounts differ somewhat, the event was \ndescribed as an atmospheric fireball as bright as the Sun. From eyewitness \naccounts, the bolide likely had an entry angle of about 30 degrees with respect \nto the horizon and an arrival azimuth angle of about 110 degrees east of north. \nThe terminal height of the explosion was estimated to be 5–12 kilometers, \nand the shock wave was accompanied by a strong blast of highly heated air.23 \nAlthough not immediately correlated with the Tunguska event, seismic and \npressure waves as well as geomagnetic disturbances were recorded in several \nwidespread observatories, and bright nights, or prolongations of twilight, were \nreported throughout Eurasia.\nFor more than a decade, no notice of the Tunguska event was taken beyond \nlocal newspapers. It was 1922 before Russian geologist Leonid A. Kulik \noutcome, Moulton wrote: “When we get in the domain of astronomical masses of \nhundreds of thousands of tons, we are like a child who, after playing a few times with \nhis rattle, suddenly sees and seeks to grasp the moon. If it is explained to him that \nit is something of quite a different order from the things of his experience, he casts \nthe statements aside as purely theoretical and, relying on his practical experience, \nreaches again, proves (to himself) the correctness of his views by the assertion that \nhe has always held them and that all other children hold them” (p. 126).

The introduction of a mineralogical diagnostic tool offered the potential \nto quell debates over ambiguous structures, both on Earth and on the Moon.47\nTurning again to the sky, Shoemaker applied his new theory of cratering \nmechanics to the prominent lunar crater Copernicus in 1962, making a strong \ncase for its impact origin. He also noted the significance of overlapping ejecta \nblankets and secondary craters—smaller craters formed by material thrown \nout by the initial impact—as a novel means of piecing together a relative his\xad\ntory of impact events. The dual advances represented by the recognition of \ncoesite and stishovite as diagnostic markers of impact and the potential of the \ncratering process itself to record relative ages marked a change in the wind \nfor Shoemaker’s impact advocacy. Although his initial efforts to secure sup\xad\nport for a lunar mapping endeavor had failed in 1956, they came to fruition \nfour years later in 1960 with the creation of the Branch of Astrogeological \nStudies within the USGS at Menlo Park. In another two years, while his \ncolleagues there were poking fun at “Dream Moonshaker,” Gene Shoemaker \nwas focused on moving his headquarters to Flagstaff, Arizona, preparing for \na space program that would invest in and rely on a geologic understanding of \nthe impact process.\nAs the formation of the Astrogeology Branch attests, the establishment \nof NASA in 1958 and the announcement of the Apollo project in 1961 both \ngalvanized and supported work on impact cratering in the decades that fol\xad\nlowed. This was due in part to overestimates of the meteoroid flux by early \nsatellite measurements, perceived to be a major threat to space vehicles. \nUnderstanding of cratering mechanics was bolstered by postwar research on \nhigh-velocity impact and explosion mechanics, leading to new computational \nand experimental methods, including the first numerical simulation of the \nMeteor Crater impact in 1961 and the establishment of the Vertical Gun \nRange at NASA Ames in 1965.48 By the end of the decade, astronauts had \nattested to the dominance of impact cratering on the Moon, the far side of the \n47.\t Doel, Solar System Astronomy in America; Edward C.\xa0T.

These strands of inquiry \nincluded the geological investigation of terrestrial impact and cryptovolca\xad\nnic features, the impact origin of lunar craters, the mechanics of cratering \nas a physical process, and the identification of unique signatures associated \nwith\xa0impact.\nWhile many geologists and astronomers had been convinced by 1929 of \nMeteor Crater’s cosmic origin, the same could not yet be said for lunar craters, \nas illustrated by the limited success of the Carnegie Committee for the Study \nof the Surface Features of the Moon. Founded in the mid-1920s and directed \nby petrologist Frederick E. Wright, the interdisciplinary committee was com\xad\nposed of astronomers, physicists, and geologists and was aimed at definitively \nsettling the question of the origin of lunar craters. While most members of \nthe committee supported the volcanic theory, Wright eschewed the use of \nterrestrial analogs, focusing instead of determining the nature of lunar mate\xad\nrials.31 Unfortunately, Wright’s approach, which focused on polarization \nlake bottom, and evidence has been raised both for and against this hypothesis.

The Meteor Crater event refers to a meteor impact that occurred in Arizona, USA. It is also known as the Barringer Crater. The event is significant because it is the first impact crater on Earth to be recognized as such, and it provided important evidence for the hypothesis that some craters on the Moon and other planets were caused by meteor impacts.

Some key characteristics of the Meteor Crater event are:

- The crater is approximately 1.2 kilometers in diameter and 170 meters deep.
- The meteor that caused the crater was estimated to be about 50 meters in diameter and weighed approximately 300,000 metric tons.
- The impact event occurred about 50,000 years ago.
- The energy released during the impact was equivalent to about 20 megatons of TNT, which is roughly 1,300 times the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
- The impact caused a shock wave that melted and vaporized rock, creating a crater and ejecting material that formed a surrounding rim.
- The impact also created a shock wave that traveled through the ground, causing seismic activity that was detected up to 80 kilometers away.
- The impact event would have caused a loud explosion and a bright fireball that could have been seen for hundreds of kilometers.
- The impact event would have also created a significant amount of dust and debris that could have affected the local climate and ecosystem."

As a symbol of American tech\xad\nnological excellence and as the launch system for NASA’s astronaut corps, it \nreceived high marks. But the program failed to achieve its core objective: low\xad\nering the cost of reaching Earth orbit. In fact, President Nixon stated in 1972 \nthat the Shuttle’s “resulting economies may bring operating costs down as low \nas one-tenth of those present launch vehicles.”14 Granted, this was an extraordi\xad\nnarily elusive goal, but disappointment over not achieving it has plagued NASA \nand brought cynicism from the public for a wide array of U.S. space efforts. \nCost control remains a goal that must be emphasized in the development and \noperation of any new human launch vehicle.', 'NASA and the Post–Cold War Launch Vehicle Challenge\n9\n•\t The United States should undertake extensive design of new East and West \nCoast launch facilities as soon as possible. Existing facilities were deterio\xad\nrating and becoming increasingly expensive to operate. \n•\t A 20,000-pound-payload-class vehicle should be the first of the proposed \nNational Launch Systems (NLS) vehicles to be designed and built. The \nNRC further recommended that the design and fabrication of this \nvehicle be coordinated with the construction of the new launch facili\xad\nties. (The committee noted that this vehicle would be the least com\xad\nplex and least expensive of the proposed NLS vehicles and would be \nthe most likely to have commercial as well as national security appli\xad\ncations, adding that, based on NASA and Department of Defense \nprojections, the 20,000-pound-payload requirement had the greatest \ngrowth potential and that this vehicle class would utilize most of the \nnew technologies currently anticipated for the NLS\xa0vehicles.) \n•\t Investment in improvements for the Space Shuttle orbiter and its subsys\xad\ntems should continue. \n•\t Reliability should have top priority in the design of new systems, even at \nthe expense of greater up-front costs and lower performance. The com\xad\nmittee added that the cost of failure in terms of time, money, and \nnational prestige far outweighed the costs of built-in reliability. \n•\t The United States should seek a one-third to one-half reduction in launch \nand operations costs in order for the United States to remain competitive \nin the launch vehicle market. The committee added that this was sec\xad\nond in importance only to reliability. \nPropulsion \n•\t Development and qualification of the Space Transportation Main Engine \n(STME) should proceed immediately and vigorously. \n•\t Efforts underway to improve the reliability, reduce the cost, and sim\xad\nplify production and refurbishment of the Space Shuttle Main Engine \n(SSME) should be continued.

(The Space Shuttle made its last flight on \nJuly\xa08,\xa02011). \n•\t The growth of a family of vehicles would best be accomplished by using \nstrap-on boosters that, to enhance reliability, would be designed to allow \npad hold-down with engine shutdown capability, as well as to be throt\xad\ntleable. The committee added that liquid, solid, and hybrid boosters \ncould all be candidates as long as they incorporated the above attri\xad\nbutes. They added, however, that a number of considerations favored \nliquid over solid propulsion systems because liquid rocket engines', 'Designing and Building the X-34\n131\none could successfully undertake design development of a low-cost, quick-\nturnaround boost system.

The \nadministration established this requirement for the sake of astronaut safety \nand also to support the development of a U.S. commercial launch indus\xad\ntry. As a result of this policy, NASA would have to add expendable launch \nvehicles to its fleet for robotic space missions, just as the SESAC report had \nrecommended. The policy change represented a confluence of national and \nspace science priorities and had a wide-ranging impact on NASA’s entire \nportfolio of science flight projects.\nStrategic Changes in Advisory Structure\nFollowing the SSEC and SESAC reports, both of which called for NASA to \nimplement an overarching science strategy, NASA’s Office of Space Science \nand Applications (OSSA) introduced a strategic planning process in 1987. \nUnder OSSA Director Lennard Fisk, the office released its first annual stra\xad\ntegic plan in 1988.47 The scientific community embraced the process because \nit provided transparency for NASA’s mission plans, and NASA contractors \nsupported the strategic plan because it enabled them to more effectively \nestablish their own long-term strategies. The plan also provided the scien\xad\ntific community with a more unified voice on programmatic matters, as it \nlaid out the order in which NASA would approve projects. It was clear, then, \nthat completion of one project’s development would allow for the start of the \nnext project in line.\nIn 1989, under Chairman Louis Lanzerotti, the Space Science Board \nchanged its name to the Space Studies Board to reflect an expansion of SSB \nactivities. Prior to the 1990s, the SSB’s reports tended to focus on relatively \nnarrow fields within each of the disciplines in space science. The one excep\xad\ntion was astronomy, for which the board had long issued reports relating \nto the discipline in its entirety.

But the program failed to achieve its core objective: lowering the cost of reaching Earth orbit. In fact, President Nixon stated in 1972 that the Shuttle’s “resulting economies may bring operating costs down as low as one-tenth of those present launch vehicles.”14 Granted, this was an extraordinarily elusive goal, but disappointment over not achieving it has plagued NASA and brought cynicism from the public for a wide array of U.S. space efforts. Cost control remains a goal that must be emphasized in the development and operation of any new human launch vehicle.

In addition, the Space Shuttle must be viewed as a triumph of engineering and excellence in technological management. As such, it has been an enormously successful program. The research, development, and operation of the Space Shuttle represent a worthy follow-on to the spectacularly successful Apollo program of the 1960s and early 1970s. 
Third, the Space Shuttle proved to be a flexible space vehicle. Most assuredly, the range of possibilities for operations on orbit expanded dramatically with the launch of Columbia in 1981. The ability to carry a diversity of payloads, to accomplish a myriad of tasks on orbit, and to deploy and retrieve satellites are attributes that need to be considered in any effort to develop a follow-on system. A successor to the Space Shuttle should approach a similar level of flexibility that this vehicle has demonstrated, and it is important to consider the uniqueness of the orbiter’s capabilities in planning for the future.

Existing facilities were deterio\xad\nrating and becoming increasingly expensive to operate. \n•\t A 20,000-pound-payload-class vehicle should be the first of the proposed \nNational Launch Systems (NLS) vehicles to be designed and built. The \nNRC further recommended that the design and fabrication of this \nvehicle be coordinated with the construction of the new launch facili\xad\nties. (The committee noted that this vehicle would be the least com\xad\nplex and least expensive of the proposed NLS vehicles and would be \nthe most likely to have commercial as well as national security appli\xad\ncations, adding that, based on NASA and Department of Defense \nprojections, the 20,000-pound-payload requirement had the greatest \ngrowth potential and that this vehicle class would utilize most of the \nnew technologies currently anticipated for the NLS\xa0vehicles.) \n•\t Investment in improvements for the Space Shuttle orbiter and its subsys\xad\ntems should continue. \n•\t Reliability should have top priority in the design of new systems, even at \nthe expense of greater up-front costs and lower performance. The com\xad\nmittee added that the cost of failure in terms of time, money, and \nnational prestige far outweighed the costs of built-in reliability. \n•\t The United States should seek a one-third to one-half reduction in launch \nand operations costs in order for the United States to remain competitive \nin the launch vehicle market. The committee added that this was sec\xad\nond in importance only to reliability. \nPropulsion \n•\t Development and qualification of the Space Transportation Main Engine \n(STME) should proceed immediately and vigorously. \n•\t Efforts underway to improve the reliability, reduce the cost, and sim\xad\nplify production and refurbishment of the Space Shuttle Main Engine \n(SSME) should be continued.

The \nadministration established this requirement for the sake of astronaut safety \nand also to support the development of a U.S. commercial launch indus\xad\ntry. As a result of this policy, NASA would have to add expendable launch \nvehicles to its fleet for robotic space missions, just as the SESAC report had \nrecommended. The policy change represented a confluence of national and \nspace science priorities and had a wide-ranging impact on NASA’s entire \nportfolio of science flight projects.\nStrategic Changes in Advisory Structure\nFollowing the SSEC and SESAC reports, both of which called for NASA to \nimplement an overarching science strategy, NASA’s Office of Space Science \nand Applications (OSSA) introduced a strategic planning process in 1987. \nUnder OSSA Director Lennard Fisk, the office released its first annual stra\xad\ntegic plan in 1988.47 The scientific community embraced the process because \nit provided transparency for NASA’s mission plans, and NASA contractors \nsupported the strategic plan because it enabled them to more effectively \nestablish their own long-term strategies. The plan also provided the scien\xad\ntific community with a more unified voice on programmatic matters, as it \nlaid out the order in which NASA would approve projects. It was clear, then, \nthat completion of one project’s development would allow for the start of the \nnext project in line.\nIn 1989, under Chairman Louis Lanzerotti, the Space Science Board \nchanged its name to the Space Studies Board to reflect an expansion of SSB \nactivities. Prior to the 1990s, the SSB’s reports tended to focus on relatively \nnarrow fields within each of the disciplines in space science. The one excep\xad\ntion was astronomy, for which the board had long issued reports relating \nto the discipline in its entirety. For example, the SSB issued its first decadal \nreport, on ground-based astronomy priorities, in 1964.48 The SSB expanded \nthe scope of its next report, addressing Astronomy and Astrophysics for \n47.\t Lennard Fisk, interview by Rebecca Wright for the NASA Headquarters Oral History \nProject, Ann Arbor, MI, 8 September 2010, found at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) History \nOffice Oral History Project website, https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/\nhistory/oral_histories/NASA_HQ/Administrators/FiskLA/FiskLA_9-8-10.htm (accessed \n30\xa0July 2020).\n48.\t National Academy of Sciences, Ground-Based Astronomy: A Ten-Year Program \n(Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 1964).', 'Aerodynamics Modeling, Testing, and Thermal Protection\n177\nSelecting a TPS system that utilized thermal blankets and ceramic tiles, \nhowever, allowed Orbital to take advantage of a technology previously dem\xad\nonstrated on the Space Shuttle, along with the subsequent developments that \nimproved the operational characteristics of these TPS materials. An advan\xad\ntage of the flexible blankets was that they could be adhesively bonded to a \nnonsmooth surface. In addition, they were considered to be fairly tolerant \nof the “over temperatures” that might be associated with heating uncertain\xad\nties.42 The leeward-side thermal protection blankets varied in thickness along \nthe chord since insulation requirements were more severe toward the leading \nedge. This factor, combined with manufacturing requirements, led to a wing \ndesign with a “sufficient low-speed lift-to-drag ratio and adequate supersonic \nand hypersonic handling characteristics while meeting structural and thermal \ndesign and manufacturing goals.”43 The blankets chosen for the leeward side \nhad more design flexibility for blanket type and thickness and had the highest \ntemperature and insulation properties with high thermal protection margins. \nBecause of these factors, NASA Langley’s aerodynamic heating analysis focused \non obtaining maximum leeward heating environments. The windward surface \nof the X-34 was protected by constant-thickness TPS blankets. This was dic\xad\ntated by outer mold line requirements and cost constraints.44\nNASA Ames performed detailed heating analyses of the elevon hinge line \nand cove area and Orbital performed similar heating analyses of the back \nside of the speed brake and body flap hinge line. Sealing and protecting \nthese areas required a degree of “engineering judgment and novel approaches \n[and] In general, conservative assumptions were made in areas where data do \nnot\xa0exist.”45 \nIn reviewing NASA Langley’s aerothermal analysis and testing, research \nengineers Kathryn E. Wurster, Christopher J. Riley, and E. Vincent Zoby \nnoted the “methodology [including wind-tunnel testing and computational \nfluid dynamics] by which the aerothermal environments for the X-34 [were] \npredicted in sufficient detail to allow design of the TPS such that the surviv\xad\nability, as well as the reusability, of the flight vehicle [was] ensured to a high \ndegree of certainty.” The compressed schedule for the X-34 posed a particu\xad\nlar challenge, Wurster, Riley, and Zoby acknowledged that its anticipated \n2-and-a-half–year span from the date of the awarding of the final contract to \nfirst flight constituted a “remarkably short time frame” to design the vehicle, \norder materials, manufacture components, test the engine, build ground \nfacilities, address anticipated operational issues, assemble the X-34, modify \nits L-1011 mother ship, and ready the program for flight. “The extraordinary \npace of this program,” they noted, “required that the thermal environments \nbe generated in parallel with design of the vehicle and development of the \nflight profile.”46', 'NASA and the Post–Cold War Launch Vehicle Challenge\n7\napproximately 90 percent of all future payloads would fall into this category, \nand that the advanced-technology vehicle would replace all Delta- and Atlas-\nclass missions and meet Space Station logistics resupply requirements.18 The \nfindings also addressed operating-cost-saving issues, noting that the single-\nstage-to-orbit all-rocket vehicle operating cost was estimated to be approxi\xad\nmately one-third of the Space Shuttle costs. They stated that this would be \npossible “through the use of a single, fully reusable airframe coupled with \nchanges in the space launch operations culture.”19\nIn regard to this “culture” reference, all three Option Teams recognized \nthat “if large savings in annual costs were to be realized, new management, \ncontracting, design, development, and, particularly, operations concepts had \nto be devised. The fundamental change required was that all phases had to be \ndriven by efficient operations rather than by attainment of maximum perfor\xad\nmance levels. This, in turn, required maximizing automation and minimizing \nthe number of people in the ‘standing army’ on the ground, as well as requir\xad\ning redundancy, engine-out capacity, and robust margins in all subsystems.”20 \nSubsequently, NASA’s effort to change its model for doing business resulted \nin the Agency’s controversial “faster, better, cheaper” policy, reviewed subse\xad\nquently in chapter 2. \nThe Access to Space study concluded with the following recommendations:21 \n•\t Adopt the development of an advanced technology, fully reusable \nsingle-stage-to-orbit rocket vehicle as an Agency goal.\n•\t Pursue a technology maturation and demonstration program as a first \nphase of this activity that also should include “a complementary exper\xad\nimental rocket vehicle technology demonstration flight program.”22 \n•\t The technology, advanced development, and experimental vehicle \nprograms should be coordinated with the Department of Defense.\n•\t The Space Shuttle and the current expendable launch vehicle pro\xad\ngrams should be continued. The most beneficial and cost-effective \nupgrades should be considered for incorporation into these vehicles \nuntil the new single-stage-to-orbit vehicle becomes available. \n•\t Although the focus of these recommendations is a technology mat\xad\nuration and demonstration program, additional studies should be \nconducted in parallel. They include system trade studies for the \nsingle-stage-to-orbit rocket vehicle configuration in order to guide \nthe technology activities, and assessment of a fly-back reusable liquid \nbooster concept for the Space Shuttle. \n•\t The National Aero-Space Plane enabling technology program should \nbe continued as a separate and distinct activity, as it contributes to \nfuture defense and civilian hypersonic aircraft programs, and it has \npotentially unique future mission applications.']","

"How has the partnership between JAXA and PeptiDream Inc. accelerated drug development and reduced overall research costs, as described in the context information?","The partnership between JAXA and PeptiDream Inc. has accelerated drug development and reduced overall research costs by increasing the number of protein samples from five to 30 over the lifetime of the agreement and doubling the launching frequency from twice to four times a year. This has allowed for more precise modeling of the structure of key proteins involved in disease and has led to the discovery of a new enzyme, DAP BII (DPP7), which is essential for the growth of pathogenic bacteria, including those that cause periodontal disease and hospital-acquired infections. By developing antimicrobial agents that inhibit the function of DAP BII (DPP7) and other enzymes in the DPP family, which are only found in microorganisms, the research team aims to create new drugs that target only DPP of microorganisms, but have no effect on humans. The improved complex structure, known as TAS-205, has been shown to reduce or slow the expansion of muscle necrosis in mice and dogs. In 2015, the multinational Taiho Pharmaceutical Corporation verified that the TAS-205 inhibitor is safe for use in humans. This partnership has the potential to produce new and better drugs for Japan and the world.","['22\nend-users with high-quality utilization services for Kibo \nfacilities.

The ISS U.S. \nNational Laboratory also hosts a significant number of \nPCG experiments. Many pharmaceutical companies, \nincluding Eli Lilly, Merck, Taiho Pharmaceutical, and \nPeptiDream, have conducted PCG investigations \non the space station. These activities provide many \nexamples of potential humankind benefits, which \nwould have high economic value as well.\nOne such investigation, JAXA PCG, crystallized \na protein of interest to researchers focused on \nDuchenne’s muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a \nsevere condition that causes progressive muscular \ndegeneration, often leaving the affected patients unable \nto walk by early adolescence. In 2002, a research \ninvestigation revealed a specific protein (H-PGDS) \nthat was expressed in necrotic muscle fibers in DMD \npatients. This discovery fueled the development of \nspecific inhibitors of H-PGDS as potential therapeutic \nagents, and motivated researchers to grow \nmacroscopic protein-inhibitor complexes to map \nthe structures at the highest resolutions. The analysis \nof the structure of H-PGDS and inhibitor complex \ngrown as part of the JAXA PCG investigation on the \nISS led to an improved complex structure (TAS-205), \nwhich is considerably more effective inhibitor than those \nunder investigation at that time. Subsequent tests \nshowed that TAS-205 did reduce or slow the expansion \nof muscle necrosis in mice and dogs. In 2015, the \nmultinational Taiho Pharmaceutical Corporation verified  \nthat the TAS-205 inhibitor is safe for use in humans. \n...PCG on the space station holds \nthe promise of reducing overall \nresearch costs for pharmaceutical \ncompanies, thereby allowing them \nto more accurately predict how \ncandidate drugs will perform and \nmore precisely model the structure \nof key proteins involved in disease.\nIn 2017, TAS-205 completed a 24-week Phase II trial \nwith 33 human DMD patients. \nMerck Research Laboratories is conducting PCG \nresearch onboard the ISS to develop a subcutaneous \n(SC) formulation of the immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, \nwhich is currently administered via an intravenous \n(IV) injection. SC reformulations of similar drugs, such \nas Herceptin, provided a 44% savings in time and a \n77% savings in medical staff effort over IV delivery. \nIn addition, over 90% of patients preferred the SC \nformulation due to reduced pain, discomfort and side \neffects. Also, if the SC reformulation is more stable at \nroom temperature, it will reduce costs associated with \nstorage and transportation. \nForbes analysts state that Merck’s first quarter growth \nin 2018 can be attributed primarily to growth in the \noncology segment, notably through Keytruda’s year-\nover-year growth to $1.46 billion. Through advances \nin delivery mechanisms such as SC reformulations, \nMerck may be able to further capitalize on Keytruda’s \npotential sales.\nThe PCG line of research with its potential new \ntherapeutic drugs, as well as the nanochannel-based \ndelivery mechanisms that can reduce or eliminate visits \nto the doctor’s office and increase the percentage of \npatients who take the proper dosage on time, illustrates \nhow investigations aboard the ISS can lead, over time, \nto emerging applications on Earth with significant \npotential humankind benefits and economic value.\nHowever, rapid and repeat access to test multiple \ncrystallization conditions is an important factor that \nunderlies the success or failure of specific efforts \non specific proteins. Not all PCG efforts will result \nin improved crystals or structures in spaceflight. \nHowever, each protein that is successful, as will be \nillustrated in the next section on maturing and concrete \nbenefits, has the potential for significant economic \nimpact if it can be developed into a new approach \nfor treating disease.\n\nEarth Observation Data\nData sets generated by the many Earth observing \ninstruments hosted on ISS external platforms are \nanother source of new data being exploited for \neconomic benefit.

Dr. Sakamoto explains this newly \ndiscovered enzyme: In the course of the research, \nthis enzyme, named DAP BII (DPP7), was found to \nbe important for the proliferation and growth of a group \nof bacteria: Non-Fermenting Gram Negative Rods \n(NFGNR), which live by using peptides and proteins as \ntheir nutrients. NFGNR includes the causative bacteria \nof periodontal disease and hospital-acquired infection. \nIncidentally, periodontal disease is the most widespread \ninfectious disease among human beings. When he \nstarted this study, he considered this enzyme to be \nboth unusual and interesting. Then Dr. Sakamoto also \nconsidered that if a substance could inhibit the function \nof DAP BII (DPP7), which is essential for growth of the \npathogen, and other enzymes in the DPP family, \nthe substance would become an antimicrobial agent. \nThus, the research team also decided to develop \nantimicrobial agents.\nSeveral types of DPPs exist, and each one works \ndifferently. For example, DAP BII (DPP7) recognizes \nand cleaves hydrophobic or basic amino acids. \nOn the other hand, DPP11 recognizes acidic amino \nacids. These enzymes are not found in humans, they \nare only found in microorganisms. In other words, if you \ncan make medicines to suppress the function of these \nenzymes, it is harmless for humans and only suppresses \nthe growth of bacteria. If the peptide binding mode of \nprotein is clarified in detail, a new drug could be created \nthat targets only DPP of microorganisms, but has no \neffect on humans.

The partnership between JAXA and PeptiDream Inc. has accelerated drug development and reduced overall research costs in several ways. Firstly, the fee-based agreement between the two entities increased the number of protein samples from five to 30 over the lifetime of the agreement. This increase in the number of protein samples has allowed for more extensive research and development of new drugs.

Secondly, JAXA doubled the launching frequency from twice to four times a year to meet the requirements from PeptiDream and other users. This increase in launching frequency has allowed for faster development and testing of new drugs, thereby accelerating the drug development process.

Thirdly, the increased number of protein samples and launching frequency have reduced overall research costs. By having more protein samples and launching more frequently, PeptiDream Inc. can conduct more research and development within the same time frame, thereby reducing the cost per unit of research and development.

Lastly, the partnership has also allowed PeptiDream Inc. to expand Kibo utilization in its collaborative research activities with other entities. This expansion of Kibo utilization has further accelerated the drug development process and reduced overall research costs."
"What was the reason for the discovery of a failure in one of the power processing units during the thermal vac test, and how did the team handle it to ensure the June launch?","During the thermal vac test, a failure was discovered in one of the power processing units. The team found one that might work at the nearby Naval Research Laboratory. However, the Dawn project had to modify the chamber to add additional pumping capacity and cold fingers to extract the xenon from the beam, augmenting the chamber out of their own funds. The spacecraft passed its full baseline test at Orbital and was thus shipped to the Naval Research Laboratory.

After the thermal vac test, the team discovered that one of the power processing units had a failure during a test readiness review. This put the project in a bad situation, as they needed to make the June launch and did not have enough reserves to make it to September. The team worked the issues in parallel and ran the tests. Dave Shiderly, the Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations manager, began to rework the ATLO schedule to make it happen.

The team discussed options and proposed a compromise: rerun just the acoustic test to validate the reassembly of the spacecraft, rather than rerunning the full suite of environmental tests. This was due to the fact that the whole spacecraft had already completed the whole series of environmental tests.

The root causes of the CONTOUR mission's failure were identified as the project's reliance on ""analyses by similarity,"" inadequate systems engineering processes, and inadequate reviews. Significant observations included the lack of telemetry during a critical event, significant reliance on subcontractors without adequate oversight, insight, and review, inadequate communication between APL and subcontractor Alliant Techsystems, use of Alliant Techsystems analytic models that were not specific to CONTOUR, limited understanding of plume heating environments for the solid rocket motor in space, no plan for encounters with orbital debris, and a limited understanding of CONTOUR and solid rocket motor operating conditions.

In terms of the CONTOUR mission's failure, memories would differ about the fundamental issues of the solid rocket motor. Project Manager Mary Chiu was never contacted by the MIB, despite being in overall charge of spacecraft success. Farquhar, now deceased, described in his memoir the CONTOUR disaster data captured by military assets, along with his disdain of the MIB's findings.","['NASA′s Discovery Program\n242\ncould not be bumped.

As Patel recalled: \nWe had a test readiness review before we closed the key vac door. And at that point, every \nsubsystem swears up and down that they’ve reviewed all the data, and everything is go, \nor these are the issues, and this is why it’s okay to proceed…. [We] closed the door, and \nthe next day we discovered that one of the [power processing units] has a failure.… There \nwas a set of senior people at Orbital who wanted to break chamber that day. And I said, \n“No, we’re not going to break chamber that day. We’re going to plow through.” The way I \nbrought everybody around to that realization was the following: Thermal vac test is not a \nperformance test. It is a test you do to validate the thermal model. So, if you have failure \nin one box, you can go to the other box, do the test, but you have to be, now, really diligent \nshould another failure happen, how you control the stuff in there…. And in a way, I’m glad \nwe discovered this inside the chamber, because, if we had discovered this outside the cham\xad\nber, the June launch would have been jeopardized. In fact, it would not have happened.169\nThe project was now, once again, in a bad situation. Politically and financially, they \nreally needed to make the June launch.

The discovery of a failure in one of the power processing units during the thermal vac test was unexpected and posed a significant challenge for the team, as they were aiming for a June launch. The thermal vac test was not a performance test but rather a validation of the thermal model. The team decided to continue with the test, ensuring proper control of the spacecraft's components in case of another failure.

The Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations manager, Dave Shiderly, reworked the ATLO schedule to accommodate the necessary repairs and tests. After the thermal vac test, the team broke chamber, removed the faulty power processing unit box, and sent it to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for fixing. Once fixed, they shipped it back, reinserted it into the spacecraft, and prepared to run penalty tests before delivering it to the Cape.

The team initially disagreed on the extent of the penalty tests required, with Patel advocating for skipping them and Orbital leadership insisting on rerunning the full suite. Patel proposed a compromise, suggesting they rerun just the acoustic test to validate the reassembly of the spacecraft. This approach allowed them to ensure the spacecraft's readiness for the June launch while addressing the discovered issue in the power processing unit."
What is thrust vectoring and how was it used in the NASA F/A-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle and F-15 ACTIVE Nozzles? Provide specific details from the context information.,"Thrust vectoring is a technology that allows for the deflection of engine exhaust nozzles to control the direction of thrust. In the context of the NASA F/A-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) and F-15 ACTIVE Nozzles, thrust vectoring was used to enhance maneuverability and control at high angles of attack. The HARV program, which consisted of three phases, explored the use of vectored thrust to enhance maneuverability and control at high angles of attack. The second phase, 193 flights conducted between July 1991 and June 1994, involved the use of a multi-axis thrust-vectoring system for installation on the exhaust nozzles of the F/A-18’s two GE F404 turbofan engines. The system consisted of a research flight control system that directed three paddle-like vanes, one set for each engine, made from the heat-resistant alloy Inconel, to deflect engine thrust. The thrust-vectoring system increased the high-alpha capa­bility of the F/A-18 by a third, up to 70 degrees.

The F-15 ACTIVE Nozzles, on the other hand, were developed as part of the NASA Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles (ACTIVE) program, which was a joint NASA, U.S. Air Force, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA), and Pratt & Whitney (P&W) program. The F-15 was modified with the pitch-yaw balance beam nozzles (PYBBN) to incorporate thrust vectoring. The PYBBN system enabled vectoring horizontally (yaw) and vertically (pitch). The ACTIVE team incorporated Lewis’s High Stability Engine Control (HISTEC) project into its flight program during the summer of 1997. The HISTEC project aimed to improve engine operating stability to encourage the development of higher-performance military aircraft and more fuel-efficient commercial airliners. During the flight program, the ACTIVE team achieved the first supersonic yaw-vectoring flight on April 24, 1996.

Overall, thrust vectoring provided more stability at high angles of attack during close-in maneuvering","['Propulsion Control Enters the Computer Era, 1976–1998\n155\nearly-model McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, an aircraft known for its high \nmaneuverability, as surplus from the U.S. Navy and modified it for the HATP \nmission with the designation F/A-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV).50The exhaust plume from the left engine of NASA\'s F/A-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) is deflected upward by the paddle-like vanes of the aircraft\'s thrust vectoring system during an early morning ""hot loads"" ground test of the system at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif.\n\nFebruary 14, 1991\nFigure 5-8. The use of thrust vectoring in the HARV program was an important precedent for \nlater programs. (NASA)\nThe HARV flight research program consisted of three phases. The first and \nthird flight-test phases were not directly related to propulsion modifications.51 \nThe second phase, 193 flights conducted between July 1991 and June 1994, \nexplored the use of vectored thrust to enhance maneuverability and control \nat high angles of attack. Primary contractor McDonnell Douglas designed \na multi-axis thrust-vectoring system for installation on the exhaust nozzles \nof the F/A-18’s two GE F404 turbofan engines. The system consisted of a \nresearch flight control system that directed three paddle-like vanes, one set \nfor each engine, made from the heat-resistant alloy Inconel, to deflect engine \nthrust. Dryden project manager Donald H. Gatlin described it charitably as \n“crude” and never intended for an operational aircraft.52 Nevertheless, the \nsystem worked when the conventional aileron, rudder, and stabilator (a slab-\nsurfaced combined horizontal stabilizer and elevator) aerodynamic controls \nwere ineffective. The thrust-vectoring system increased the high-alpha capa\xad\nbility of the F/A-18 by a third, up to 70 degrees. Additional modifications', 'The Power for Flight\n156\nto the HARV included a sophisticated engine inlet pressure measurements \nsystem between the inlet entrance and the engine face. They measured pres\xad\nsure fluctuations of up to 250 Hertz at over 2,000 samples per second, which \ncontributed to a broader understanding of what happened to engine airflow \nunder extreme\xa0maneuvering.53\nWhile the HARV thrust-vectoring nozzles permitted high-alpha inves\xad\ntigations, the technology offered only a temporary means of evaluation for \nthe program. NASA’s Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles \n(ACTIVE) program specifically investigated thrust vectoring for application in \nfuture subsonic and supersonic commercial and military aircraft. Fighters bene\xad\nfited from enhanced maneuverability, while airliners like the much-anticipated \n300-passenger Mach 2 High-Speed Civil Transport would allow drag and noise \nreduction through smaller control surfaces supplemented by thrust vectoring.54 \nThey also wanted to build upon previous thrust-vectoring programs while \nintroducing the new element of safety.55 NASA and the Air Force were the \nGovernment partners; McDonnell Douglas and Pratt & Whitney served as the \nindustrial partners. Project manager Don Gatlin remarked that ACTIVE was \n“an example of government and industry cooperating to bring an important \ntechnology to maturity.”56\nNASA began the preparation of a two-seat F-15B transferred from the \nU.S. Air Force for that purpose in 1993 at Dryden.57 ACTIVE relied upon \nan Inner Loop Thrust Vectoring (ILTV) system for control. It integrated the \nF-15’s standard aerodynamic flight control surfaces, ailerons, stabilators, and \nrudders with thrust vectoring so that the pilot controlled the aircraft with \nboth the control stick and the rudder pedals. Pratt & Whitney’s Large Military \nEngines Division developed the axisymmetric system, which featured a pair of \npitch and yaw (left and right) balanced beam nozzles for each of the two new \nF100 turbofan engines. They were capable of redirecting engine exhaust flow \nup to 20 degrees in any direction. The system was much lighter than previous \nthrust-vectoring designs, and Pratt & Whitney designed it for easy retrofitting \nto existing aircraft as well as direct installation in future aircraft. An advanced \nImproved Digital Electronic Engine Controller (IDEEC) system, strength\xad\nened duct cases able to withstand the vectored thrust, and improved engine \nmounts and rear fuselage construction completed the fighter’s modification to \nthe ACTIVE configuration. Ground testing of the nozzles began in November \n1995 at the Air Force Flight Test Center’s universal horizontal thrust stand.58\nACTIVE flight testing began in March 1996. The NASA goal was to fly \nup to 100 hours at speeds of up to Mach 1.85 and at angles of attack of up \nto 30\xa0degrees.59 A series of four flights between October 31 and November\xa01, \n1996, witnessed the first time thrust vectoring was accomplished at speeds \napproaching Mach 2.60 In regard to the flight program, which ran through', ""Propulsion Control Enters the Computer Era, 1976–1998\n159\nadvanced, multirole twin-engine fighters like the F-111 and the F-15 suffered \nfrom drag problems related to the airflow at the back of the airplane where the \nangular boxy fuselage interacted with the round exhaust nozzles. To reduce that \narea of drag, the U.S. Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory worked closely \nwith Bill Henderson of Langley to develop a series of two-dimensional nozzles \nbeginning in the 1980s.68The three thrust-vectoring aircraft at Edwards, California, each capable of flying at extreme angles of attack, cruise over the California desert in formation during flight in March 1994.

Thrust vectoring is a method of controlling the direction of the exhaust from a jet engine to control the attitude or direction of an aircraft. It is achieved by deflecting the engine's exhaust gases using movable vanes or nozzles in the engine's exhaust section.
In the NASA F/A-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle, thrust vectoring was used to investigate the concept of using deployable winglike surface strakes in the nose for increased yaw control. The F/A-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle was a highly modified F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft, which was used for high angle-of-attack research. The first phase of the research generated experience in the aerodynamic measurement of high angles of attack and provided the baseline evaluation methodology for the F/A-18 from April 1987 through 1989. The third phase investigated the concept of using deployable winglike surface strakes in the nose for increased yaw control from March 1995 to September 1996.
In the F-15 ACTIVE Nozzles, thrust vectoring was used to achieve first-ever Mach 2 thrust-vectoring. The F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vectored Thrust) was a research aircraft developed by NASA to investigate vectored thrust technology. The F-15 ACTIVE used a thrust vectoring system that could deflect the exhaust gases of its engines in any direction, providing unprecedented maneuverability and control. The F-15 ACTIVE achieved its first-ever Mach 2 thrust-vectoring in November 1996."

This research has far-reaching effects that feed into many different areas of biotechnology \nas microorganisms have a role in food spoilage, waste and sewage treatment and processing, nutrient \ncycling and exchange, pollution control, and in increased greenhouse gases.\nStudying the effects of gravity on plants led to the development of an ethylene scrubber. This technology \nis now used as an air purifier that destroys airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, viruses and odors.\nThe scrubber is used for food preservation in major supermarkets, high-end refrigerator technology, \nand trucks that carry groceries to remote regions of countries such as India, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, \nto name a few. Even the health care industry benefits from the use of these units in clinics, operating \nrooms, neonatal wards and waiting rooms, thereby making these locations safer for their inhabitants.\nPlant research in a space greenhouse has permitted the study of root zone substrates in space, thereby \nallowing scientists to improve predictions of how artificial soils will behave when irrigated both in space \nand on Earth in experimental forests.\nMicrobiology Applications from Fungal \nResearch in Space\nMicroorganisms have both negative and beneficial \neffects. Different species of fungi are inherent in many \nof these processes, and can do the following:\n•\t Spoil food, but assist in waste and sewage \ntreatment and processing as well as nutrient cycling \nand exchange.\n•\t Assist in pollution control but also increase \ngreenhouse gases.\n•\t Cause disease but can be used in the manufacture \nof antibiotics, detergents and pesticides.\n•\t Cause deterioration in manufactured materials and \nbuildings but can also be used in the recovery of \nmetals in the mining sector as well as the production \nof biofuels and fertilizers. \n•\t Provide insight into one species, which may \nprovide insights into others and hence feed \ninto different applications.\nThe Growth and Survival of Coloured Fungi in Space-A \n(CFS-A) experiment determined the changes that \nweightlessness and cosmic radiation have on the \ngrowth and survival of various coloured fungi species. \nUnderstanding any changes in the physiology and \nsurvivability of different microorganisms in space \ncan help determine the effect that this may have on \nspacecraft, on associated systems and supplies, and \non the astronauts who inhabit them. This could provide \nimportant insights for developing countermeasures \nto possibly deleterious microorganisms, help to draw \nconclusions on how the space environment may \naffect similar organisms, and feed into biotechnology \napplications in the future. \nThe main fungal species studied in the CFS-A \nexperiment was Ulocladium chartarum, which is well \nknown to be involved in biodeterioration of organic \nand inorganic materials and suspected to be a possible \ncontaminant in spacecraft. Other species studied were: \nAspergillus niger (which causes a disease called black \nmold on certain fruits and vegetables, and commercially \naccounts for 99% of global commercial citric acid \nproduction); Cladosporium herbarum (frequently \nthe most prominent mold spore in air and found on \ndead herbaceous and woody plants, textiles, rubber, \npaper and foodstuffs of all kinds); and Basipetospora \nhalophile (which survives in high-saline environments). \nAs we gain knowledge of the life \nhistories of key species of fungi in the \nspace environment, that knowledge \ncan be readily applied to better \nmanage these species on Earth.', '162\ngreenhouse on the ISS Russian Segment.

The ability to produce high-energy, \nlow-mass food sources during spaceflight will enable \nthe maintenance of crew health during long-duration \nmissions while having a reduced impact on resources \nnecessary for long-distance travel.\nThe Advanced Astroculture™ (ADVASC) investigation, \nled by Weijia Zhou, Ph.D., formerly of the Wisconsin \nCenter for Space Automation and Robotics, University \nof Wisconsin-Madison, explored the benefits of \nusing microgravity to create custom crops that can \nwithstand the inhospitable climates of space, can resist \npestilence, and will need less volume in which to grow. \nADVASC was performed over several ISS expeditions \nwhere it grew two generations of Arabidopsis thaliana \n(i.e., a rapidly growing, flowering plant in the mustard \nfamily that has been grown on many space missions), \nand soybean plants from seed to seed in space using \nthe ADVASC payload—an autonomously operated \nplant growth unit. The ability to grow plants from \nseeds through several generations has proven to \nbe challenging in space and is critical in developing \nhardware and operational concepts to take human \nexplorers farther beyond low-Earth orbit.\nIn addition to eliminating virtually \nall known airborne germs \nand diseases, the technology \nreduces the burden on high-\nefficiency particulate air filters \nand laminar flow environments. \nWhile serving as a unique plant-growth chamber, \nthe ADVASC hardware design has also contributed \nto national security, cancer-fighting pharmaceuticals \nand educational tools for students. ADVASC’s novel \nair scrubber was designed to remove ethylene from \nthe chamber atmosphere to increase longevity of the \nproduce. Ethylene—a naturally occurring, odorless, \ncolorless gas given off by plants—hastens the ripening \nof fruits and the aging of flowers, thus encouraging \ndecay. In closed growing environments such as a \nspacecraft or terrestrial greenhouse, ethylene builds up \nquickly. As a result, plants mature too fast. Removing \nethylene, therefore, is important to preserving crops \nnot just in space, but also on Earth, where grocers \nand florists have an interest in longer product shelf life.\nThe ethylene-reduction device, also called the ethylene \n“scrubber,” draws air through tubes that are coated in \nthin layers of titanium dioxide. The insides of the tubes \nare exposed to ultraviolet light, which creates a simple \nchemical reaction that converts the ethylene into trace \namounts of water and carbon dioxide, both of which \nare actually good for plants.\nKES Science & Technology Inc., a Georgia-based \ncompany specializing in sustaining perishable foods, \nlicensed the ethylene-scrubbing technology from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin. KES partnered with Akida \nHoldings, of Jacksonville, Florida, which now markets \nthe NASA-developed technology as Airocide. \nAccording to the company, Airocide is the only air \npurifier that completely destroys airborne bacteria, \nmold, fungi, mycotoxins, viruses, volatile organic \ncompounds such as ethylene, and odors. The device \nhas no filters that need changing and produces no \nharmful by-products, such as the ozone created by \nsome filtration systems.\nFood preservation customers include supermarkets, \nproduce distribution facilities, food processing plants, \nwineries, distilleries, restaurants and large floral shops. \nReeves Floral, an Airocide user, reported 92% reduction \nin airborne mold and a 58% drop in airborne bacteria \nlevels after only 24 hours of operation in its floral \nstorage warehouse. These units in walk-in coolers \ncan preserve freshness of produce during storage and \ntransport, increase safety in food preparation areas, kill \nbacterial contaminants in flowers, and protect against \nspoilage and contaminants.\nUnits also have been deployed to India and the Gulf \nCooperation Council, which includes the countries of \nBahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the \nUnited Arab Emirates.', '161\nfrom ground-control experiments. When the space-\nproduced seeds were planted on the ground, plants \nthat grew were no different from the control sample.\nThe completed work has great applied value because, \nin the process of creating and operating the space \ngreenhouse, cutting-edge equipment and software \nwere developed, thereby making it possible to grow \nplants automatically. The psycho-physiological aspect \nof the interaction between humans and plants in a \nhabitable pressurized volume was studied, and data \nwere obtained on the safety of cultivating plant \nbiomass on a space station for human consumption. \nThese data are of great interest for design work \nto create productive greenhouses that are part of \npromising life support systems of any living complexes \nthat are cut off from the Earth’s biosphere. \nScientists have also studied the interaction of plants \nwith the soil. The processes by which plant roots \nreceive water, gases and nutrients are different in space \nthan they are on Earth. On Earth, gravity and surface \ntension combine to move water through soil, thus \nallowing air to move through the pore spaces in the soil \nto the plant’s roots. In space, soil is replaced with an \nartificial growth medium that is made up of small grains \nor other porous material. In microgravity, liquid moves \nthrough capillary action, where the liquid is attracted \nto the adjacent surface of a solid material. The surface \ntension of the liquid pulls additional liquid along as \neach new surface is wetted. If the plant is overwatered \nand all of the surface area and open spaces within \nthe growth medium are filled with liquid, then gas (air) \ncannot move, and the plant’s roots are deprived of air \nand oxygen. When properly wetted, as water is used \nby the roots, surface tension pulls additional liquid along \nwithout filling the pore spaces, and therefore without \npreventing oxygen from diffusing through the open \nspaces to the roots. Studies in the Lada greenhouse \nhave addressed the importance of root zone media \nin these extreme artificial conditions. Scientists have \nstudied a variety of root zone substrates—growth \nmedia, material particle sizes and packing structure—\nand learned which combinations work best. \nKnowledge of root zone substrates has allowed \nscientists to improve their predictions of how artificial \nsoils will behave when they are irrigated—in space and \non Earth—and to design specific plant growth media \nand artificial soils for greenhouses and other large-\nscale plant production facilities on Earth. Models that \ndescribe the behavior of water and oxygen learned \nfrom these space experiments have been published \nin scientific journals, thereby allowing commercial \nusers to access the information without divulging their \npropriety growth media mixtures.

Higher plants’ seeds \nformed in microgravity were biologically full-featured, \nand the plants obtained from these seeds did not differ \nfrom ordinary “earth” plants. Results also showed that \nat least four successive generations of higher plants can \ngrow and develop in spaceflight conditions. Developing \ntechnology for cultivation of higher plants will offer the \npossibility of introducing greenhouses as typical human \nlife support systems during exploration-class missions.\nRadiation \nAs astronauts will soon start exploring outside Earth’s \nprotective magnetic field, they will be exposed to more \nspace radiation such as cosmic rays or solar particles. \nThe space station provides an excellent platform for \ntesting and developing devices called dosimeters that \ndetect and quantify radiation exposure. A combination \nof passive and active dosimeters on the space station \nshow how the radiation environment—both total \nabsorbed dose and radiation spectrum—inside the \nISS Columbus module changes through the course \nof the solar cycle, as well as solar events and with \nalterations in the ISS attitude (Berger et al., 2016). \nFurthermore, the effects of spacecraft attitude, vehicle \ndocking and local shielding effects on the radiation \nenvironment have been observed. This helps in \nunderstanding how the radiation environment is affected \nboth by the space environment and by the spacecraft, \nwhich is valuable information for the ISS as well as \nfuture space exploration missions. Neutron “bubble \ndetector” dosimeters have characterized neutron \ndoses and energy within the ISS over several years. \nResults showed that despite large differences in solar \nactivities, the neutron environment was fairly constant \nin ISS modules (Smith et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2015). \nThe data will also support the development of effective \nprotective measures for deep space missions. \nResults of studies that preceded the ISS quantified \nradiation exposure to keep astronauts safe while \noutside the ISS, and found that they received more \nradiation to the skin, eyes and blood-forming organs \nthan when inside the spacecraft’s protective shielding \n(Thomson, 1999). Another investigation on the space \nstation revealed a substantial lack of uniformity in the \ndepth-dose and surface-dose distributions for spherical \n“phantom” that simulated an astronaut’s body, thus \ngiving an indication of impacts on an actual astronaut’s \nbody. The effectiveness of the radiation protection \nproperties of materials containing hydrogen to reduce \nthe doses of charged particles and neutrons was \ndemonstrated while using additional protection in \ncrew quarters. The radiation exposure rate in ISS \ncompartments was assessed for the period of active \nsun near the maximum of the solar activity in the final \nstage of its growth (Ambrožová, et al., 2017; Khulapko \net. al, 2015; Khulapko et. al, 2014; Khulapko 2016). \nThe space station provides an \nexcellent platform for testing \nand developing devices called \ndosimeters that detect and \nquantify radiation exposure. \nSeveral attempts to study radiation used living \norganisms as “biological dosimeters,” which revealed \ngenetic mutations within the nematode C. elegans, \nand contributed to understanding how DNA is affected \nby space radiation exposure (Zhao et al., 2006; Jamal \net al., 2010). Radiation damage is one of the major \nrisks of deep space missions; therefore, data collected \non the space station and technologies developed by \nthe international community will play a major role in \nensuring the safety of space exploration.\nKevlar fabric material studied on the space station \nhad comparable shielding properties with polyethylene \nmaterial, which is a traditionally favored radiation \nshielding material. These results suggest that the \nimpact resistance and flexibility make Kevlar an optimal \ncandidate as a performing element in an integrated \nshielding approach (Narici et al., 2017).']","

Removing \nethylene, therefore, is important to preserving crops \nnot just in space, but also on Earth, where grocers \nand florists have an interest in longer product shelf life.\nThe ethylene-reduction device, also called the ethylene \n“scrubber,” draws air through tubes that are coated in \nthin layers of titanium dioxide. The insides of the tubes \nare exposed to ultraviolet light, which creates a simple \nchemical reaction that converts the ethylene into trace \namounts of water and carbon dioxide, both of which \nare actually good for plants.\nKES Science & Technology Inc., a Georgia-based \ncompany specializing in sustaining perishable foods, \nlicensed the ethylene-scrubbing technology from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin. KES partnered with Akida \nHoldings, of Jacksonville, Florida, which now markets \nthe NASA-developed technology as Airocide. \nAccording to the company, Airocide is the only air \npurifier that completely destroys airborne bacteria, \nmold, fungi, mycotoxins, viruses, volatile organic \ncompounds such as ethylene, and odors. The device \nhas no filters that need changing and produces no \nharmful by-products, such as the ozone created by \nsome filtration systems.\nFood preservation customers include supermarkets, \nproduce distribution facilities, food processing plants, \nwineries, distilleries, restaurants and large floral shops. \nReeves Floral, an Airocide user, reported 92% reduction \nin airborne mold and a 58% drop in airborne bacteria \nlevels after only 24 hours of operation in its floral \nstorage warehouse. These units in walk-in coolers \ncan preserve freshness of produce during storage and \ntransport, increase safety in food preparation areas, kill \nbacterial contaminants in flowers, and protect against \nspoilage and contaminants.\nUnits also have been deployed to India and the Gulf \nCooperation Council, which includes the countries of \nBahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the \nUnited Arab Emirates.', '161\nfrom ground-control experiments. When the space-\nproduced seeds were planted on the ground, plants \nthat grew were no different from the control sample.\nThe completed work has great applied value because, \nin the process of creating and operating the space \ngreenhouse, cutting-edge equipment and software \nwere developed, thereby making it possible to grow \nplants automatically. The psycho-physiological aspect \nof the interaction between humans and plants in a \nhabitable pressurized volume was studied, and data \nwere obtained on the safety of cultivating plant \nbiomass on a space station for human consumption. \nThese data are of great interest for design work \nto create productive greenhouses that are part of \npromising life support systems of any living complexes \nthat are cut off from the Earth’s biosphere. \nScientists have also studied the interaction of plants \nwith the soil. The processes by which plant roots \nreceive water, gases and nutrients are different in space \nthan they are on Earth. On Earth, gravity and surface \ntension combine to move water through soil, thus \nallowing air to move through the pore spaces in the soil \nto the plant’s roots. In space, soil is replaced with an \nartificial growth medium that is made up of small grains \nor other porous material. In microgravity, liquid moves \nthrough capillary action, where the liquid is attracted \nto the adjacent surface of a solid material. The surface \ntension of the liquid pulls additional liquid along as \neach new surface is wetted. If the plant is overwatered \nand all of the surface area and open spaces within \nthe growth medium are filled with liquid, then gas (air) \ncannot move, and the plant’s roots are deprived of air \nand oxygen. When properly wetted, as water is used \nby the roots, surface tension pulls additional liquid along \nwithout filling the pore spaces, and therefore without \npreventing oxygen from diffusing through the open \nspaces to the roots. Studies in the Lada greenhouse \nhave addressed the importance of root zone media \nin these extreme artificial conditions. Scientists have \nstudied a variety of root zone substrates—growth \nmedia, material particle sizes and packing structure—\nand learned which combinations work best. \nKnowledge of root zone substrates has allowed \nscientists to improve their predictions of how artificial \nsoils will behave when they are irrigated—in space and \non Earth—and to design specific plant growth media \nand artificial soils for greenhouses and other large-\nscale plant production facilities on Earth. Models that \ndescribe the behavior of water and oxygen learned \nfrom these space experiments have been published \nin scientific journals, thereby allowing commercial \nusers to access the information without divulging their \npropriety growth media mixtures. Sensor technology \ndeveloped to monitor the Lada root zone is being \napplied to monitor soil properties in a state-of-the-art \nmeasurement facility at an experimental forest. \nCosmonaut Sergey Volkov (onboard engineer \nExpeditions 28/29) studies super dwarf wheat \nas part of the Rasenyia-2 investigation. \nImage credit: NASA\nCosmonaut Maxim Suraev, Expedition 22 flight \nengineer, holds Mizun lettuce plants from the \nBIO-5 Rasteniya-2 (Plants-2) experiment in \nthe Service Module during Expedition 20.\nImage credit: NASA\nColleagues from many Russian and non-Russian \norganizations participated in carrying out work \naccording to the Rasteniya program in the Lada', 'Investigation: Myocyte.\nDriss-Ecole, Dominique, et al. “Gravisensitivity and \nautomorphogenesis of lentil seedling roots grown \non board the International Space Station.” \nPhysiologia Plantarum, 134.1 (2008): 191-201. \nInvestigation: Gravi-1.\nDubeau-Laramée, Geneviève, et al. “Microflow1, a \nsheathless fiber-optic flow cytometry biomedical \nplatform: Demonstration onboard the international \nspace station.” Cytometry Part A, 85.4 (2014): \n322-331.

What was the role of the automatic backup computer program in the CONTOUR mission and why was it criticized for performing a critical maneuver 'in the blind'?,"The automatic backup computer program in the CONTOUR mission was designed to fire small thrusters, turning the spacecraft so that it would use another of its four antennas to send signals back to Earth if the main engine failed to do so. However, during the burn anomaly that led to the loss of the spacecraft, this program was criticized for performing a critical maneuver 'in the blind' due to a faulty design of the spacecraft. The motor was positioned so that hot gases from the engine exhaust unexpectedly heated the probe, causing the program to fail to accurately predict the spacecraft's position and orientation during the burn. This resulted in the spacecraft breaking into several pieces instead of completing its mission. The CONTOUR team and NASA continued to search for the spacecraft for nine days straight and then for eight hours once a week until December, but to no avail. By this time, they were beginning to understand what had happened, and shortages of dark assets believed to have been deployed to watch CONTOUR's burn over South Asia were also being investigated.","['Chapter 3: Harsh Landings\n117\nhad an automatic backup computer program—set to run 24 hours after any loss of \ncontact after the engine burn—that would fire small thrusters, turning the spacecraft \nso that it would use another of its four antennas to send signals back to Earth.104 \nNASA called the North American Aerospace Defense Command to request help \nlocating the spacecraft. Several military assets, such as ground radars used by the \nAir Force and Defense Support Program infrared early-warning satellites, could have \nobserved the 50-second burn on 15 August.105 The press criticized the agency for \nperforming the rocket burn, a critical maneuver, “in the blind,” as had been done a \nfew years earlier, during Mars Polar Lander’s failed descent to the planet’s surface.106\nAstronomers joined in the search for the lost comet hunter. Researchers at Kitt Peak, \nArecibo, and Goldstone, as well as amateurs around the world, pointed their telescopes \nat CONTOUR’s last known location, the point where it was expected to be if the engine \nhad fired normally, and many points in between, as well as other likely locations.\nBy the next morning, the news had broken that the spacecraft had been observed \nin two pieces. Jim Scotti, planetary scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory \nat the University of Arizona, and colleague Jeff Larsen, using the 70-inch telescope at \nKitt Peak, had captured a picture of two objects, just 155 miles apart, moving past the \nMoon’s orbit and away from Earth, approximately where the spacecraft was expected \nto be.107 The spacecraft had broken into several pieces, just as Comet Schwassmann–\nWachmann 3, its intended target, had broken seven years earlier.\n“We called everyone into the meeting room,” recalled Reynolds. “We had to just say, \n‘There’s three pieces. It looks bad. And we’ll keep looking, but it really does look bad.’ \n…[A]t that point it was not really recoverable, and everybody kind of accepted it.”108\nThe mission was not immediately declared a failure; there was still hope that the \ntwo pieces were an intact spacecraft and a piece of insulation, or the dust shield.109 In \naddition to the 16 August planned rotation of CONTOUR to use a different antenna \nto send its signal, the spacecraft would also send a distress signal—using both trans\xad\nmitters and all four antennas simultaneously—96 hours after the burn.110 This set of \n104 \t\nCarreau, M.

The \nspacecraft was successfully launched into a high \napogee orbit (with a period of five-and-a-half \ndays). Controllers implemented at least 23 orbital \nmaneuvers over the next 43 days (and 25 orbits) \nto position CONTOUR properly for its planned \nburn to heliocentric orbit on 15\xa0August. On that \nday, at 08:49\xa0UT, its solid propellant apogee motor \nfired as the spacecraft was approaching peri\xad\ngee over the Indian Ocean and out of radio con\xad\ntact. Unfortunately, nothing was ever heard from \nCONTOUR again. Later investigation showed \nthat the spacecraft had broken up during its burn. \nThe spacecraft probably suffered structural fail\xad\nure due to “plume heating” as its main engine was \nfiring, caused either by problems in the design of \nthe probe or the solid rocket motor\xa0itself.', 'NASA′s Discovery Program\n120\nAs an act of due diligence, mission controllers on 17 December 2002, sent commands \nto the largest piece of the tracked spacecraft, using 34-meter and 70-meter antennas \nin the DSN, and listened for a response. The session lasted 12 hours, ending just past \nmidnight. The team tried again to contact the spacecraft during a 4-hour window on \nFriday, 20 December, when the spacecraft antenna, if it still existed and was attached to \na functional spacecraft, would again be pointed at Earth. When no signal was received \nthat week, NASA and the Applied Physics Laboratory declared CONTOUR lost.128\nAPL received support for the ensuing investigation, but the science team did not \nreceive sufficient funds for an orderly closeout and archiving of the project, according \nto Veverka.129\nCONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board\nAlmost immediately, NASA convened a CONTOUR Mishap Investigation Board \n(MIB) to investigate the loss.130 APL had its own mishap investigation board, as did \nAlliant Techsystems. Each had its own motivations, and each wanted to know what \nhad gone wrong.131\nEd Weiler, the Associate Administrator for space science at NASA Headquarters, \nappointed Theron M. Bradley, Jr., the agency’s chief engineer, to lead the investiga\xad\ntion. The board would have an estimated work time of six to eight weeks.132 To help \nameliorate “information overload,” the MIB used new NASA Investigation Organizer \nsoftware to map the 145 CONTOUR mission review documents and 50 photos onto \na representation of the main spacecraft system. Beyond that, little is known publicly \nbecause of U.S. intelligence assets involved in the investigation, and only those with \nan appropriate security clearance could attend every briefing.133\nThe NASA MIB rarely commented on its work. In February 2003, Bradley broke \nthe board’s silence, telling the Associated Press that, while other causes for the loss of \nCONTOUR, such as collision with space debris, had not been ruled out, “the leading \ncause in our report” will be a faulty design of the spacecraft, with the motor positioned \nso that hot gases from the engine exhaust unexpectedly heated the probe.134\n128 \t\nLeary, W.

Engineers performed simulations on Earth using 10 inches of Nextel ceramic \ncovering and Kevlar, which would shield the spacecraft, hitting the barrier with nylon \npellets flying 15,000 miles per hour.88 \nSuch a hazardous environment made camera design difficult as well. “Dust particles \nat 28\xa0kilometers per second are not very good for precision optics,” said Jeff Warren, \nCONTOUR’s camera systems engineer. The high-resolution camera would be kept \nunder the dust shield until the last possible moment.89\nTesting\nLeading up to launch, set for 1 July 2002, the CONTOUR spacecraft was submitted to \nrigorous testing to ensure that there would be no surprises in deep space. Vibration, \nspin balance, and acoustic tests were conducted with an inert Thiokol Star 30 solid \nrocket motor attached. (It weighed 70 pounds more than the one used for flight.) To \nsimulate the motor for thermal vacuum testing, the inert motor was replaced with \nheaters. The only time the spacecraft and actual flight motor were tested together dur\xad\ning the final, pre-launch checkout at the Cape was limited to spin balance testing.90\nCONTOUR engineers, meanwhile, conducted all the recommended tests of the \nStar 30 solid rocket motor. To verify the integrity of its welds, for example, they even \nbrought the spacecraft to a medical facility and placed it in an x-ray machine. Fuel \nsamples were tested constantly.\nIn late June, launch preparations were delayed by some of the very types of particles \nthat scientists had hoped to collect: dust. This was after spiders had been found near \nthe spacecraft.91 (The would-be arachnid astronaut worried mission managers but \ndid not delay the launch—not even the one crawling on the rocket’s third stage was \ndeemed consequential enough to delay things.) Then, however, after the eight-sided \nspacecraft had been loaded atop a Delta II rocket at Cape Canaveral, and as technicians \nwere installing the payload fairing to seal in CONTOUR, they noticed a fine layer of \ndust on the spacecraft’s top solar panel.92\nThat was a showstopper.

DSN access was reduced \nto once a week after 25 August.113\nThe science team reacted strongly to the loss. Peter Thomas, a co-investigator and \nastronomer at Cornell, told a local newspaper, “At this point, it is in the hands of the \nfolks who know how to track the spacecraft down.”114 Thomas had been through a burn \nanomaly before, with NEAR, which had been out of contact for 27 hours before it was \nrecovered. Jim Bell, a co-investigator and assistant professor of astronomy at Cornell, \nalso hoped for a NEAR repeat.115 Anita Cochran, a co-investigator and astronomer \nat the University of Texas, said, “If indeed the picture is what it appears to be, we can \nonly hope to learn why it happened.”116 Instead of hearing the signal they hoped for, \nhowever, on 22 August, the team learned that new telescopic observations confirmed \nthree objects in the field where CONTOUR went missing.117\nThe mission controllers tried repeatedly to contact the spacecraft during the window \nbetween solid rocket burn and the point of no return: the time when the spacecraft’s \nhydrazine tanks would no longer be sufficient to return it on a trajectory back to Earth. \nFarquhar admitted that the chance of contact was, by then, “one chance in 10,000.”118 \nThey continued to search for the spacecraft, listening over the DSN for nine days \nstraight, and then for eight hours once a week until December.119\nBy this time, the CONTOUR team and NASA were beginning to understand what \nhad happened. The solid rocket motor shut down early, 48 seconds into the 50 second \nburn, just 3 percent shy of its optimum performance. What was not well understood \nwas why, or what might have been observed by possible “dark assets” believed to have \nbeen deployed to watch CONTOUR’s burn over South Asia.120 Shortly thereafter, a \n111 \t\nBoyd, R.

The automatic backup computer program in the CONTOUR mission was set to run 24 hours after any loss of contact after the engine burn. It would fire small thrusters, turning the spacecraft so that it would use another of its four antennas to send signals back to Earth. This program was criticized for being used during a critical maneuver 'in the blind' because it was done without any observation or knowledge of the spacecraft's position or status. This was similar to a previous mission, Mars Polar Lander, which also had a failed descent to the planet's surface. The press and astronomers criticized NASA for not having a way to observe the spacecraft during such a critical maneuver."
Question: What was the primary objective of Surveyor VII and what were the results of its mission?,"The primary objective of Surveyor VII was to conduct a purely scientific mission outside of a potential landing site for the early Apollo flights. After a successful launch and coast to the Moon, Surveyor VII landed at 01:05:36.3 UT on 10 January 1968 on the ejecta blanket emanating from the bright Tycho crater in the south of the nearside. The landing coordinates were 40.97° S / 11.44° W, about 29 kilometers north of Tycho’s rim, and 2.4 kilometers from its target. Initial photos from the surface showed surprisingly few craters, much like the mare sites, although the general area was rougher. About 21 hours after landing, ground controllers fired pyro­technic charges to drop the alpha-scattering instrument on the lunar surface. When the instrument failed to move beyond an intermediate position, controllers used the surface sampler (robot arm) to force it down. The sampler was then used to pick up soil and dig trenches, and for conducting at least 16 surface-bearing tests. Apart from taking 21,274 photographs (20,993 on the first lunar day and 45 during the second), Surveyor VII also served as a target for Earth-based lasers to accurately measure the distance between Earth and the Moon. Communications were paused with Surveyor VII at 14:12 UT on 26 January 1968, about 80 hours after sunset. Second lunar day operations began at 19:01 UT on 12 February 1968, and extended to 00:24 UT on 13 February 1968. The mission was declared a success by 1 January 1967, although the spacecraft continued to return useful data until 15 September 1971.

After a successful landing on the ejecta blanket emanating from the bright Tycho crater on 10 January 1968, Surveyor VII collected data for 80 hours during its first lunar day and","['77\n1968\n93\nSurveyor VII\nNation: USA (43)\nObjective(s): lunar soft-landing\nSpacecraft: Surveyor-G\nSpacecraft Mass: 1,040.1 kg\nMission Design and Management: NASA / JPL\nLaunch Vehicle: Atlas Centaur (AC-15 / Atlas 3C no. \n5903C / Centaur D-1A)\nLaunch Date and Time: 7 January 1968 / 06:30:00 UT\nLaunch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 36A\nScientific Instruments:\n1.\t TV camera\n2.\t alpha-scattering instrument\n3.\t surface sampler\n4.\t footpad magnets\n5.\t stereoscopic and dust detection mirrors\nResults: Since Surveyors I, III, V, and VI successfully \nfulfilled requirements in support of Apollo, NASA \nopted to use the last remaining Surveyor for a purely \nscientific mission outside of a potential landing \nsite for the early Apollo flights. After an uneventful \ncoast to the Moon (including one of two planned \nmid-course corrections), Surveyor VII successfully \nset down at 01:05:36.3 UT on 10 January 1968 on \nthe ejecta blanket emanating from the bright Tycho \ncrater in the south of the nearside. Landing coordi\xad\nnates were 40.97° S / 11.44°\xa0W, about 29 kilome\xad\nters north of Tycho’s rim, and 2.4 kilometers from \nits target. Initial photos from the surface showed \nsurprisingly few craters, much like the mare sites, \nalthough the general area was rougher. About 21 \nhours after landing, ground controllers fired pyro\xad\ntechnic charges to drop the alpha-scattering instru\xad\nment on the lunar surface. When the instrument \nfailed to move beyond an intermediate position, \ncontrollers used the surface sampler (robot arm) to \nforce it down. The sampler was then used to pick \nup the alpha-scattering instrument after its first \nchemical analysis and move it to two additional \nlocations. About 66 hours of alpha-scattering data \nwere obtained during the first lunar day on three \nsamples: the undisturbed lunar surface, a Moon \nrock, and an area dug up by the surface sampler. \nThe alpha-scattering instrument collected 34 more \nhours of data during the second lunar day. The \nscoop on the sampler’s arm was used numerous \ntimes for picking up soil and digging trenches, and \nfor conducting at least 16 surface-bearing tests. \nApart from taking 21,274 photographs (20,993 \non the first lunar day and 45 during the second), \nSurveyor VII also served as a target for Earth-\nbased lasers (of 1 watt power) to accurately mea\xad\nsure the distance between Earth and the Moon. \nCommunications were paused with Surveyor VII \nat 14:12 UT on 26 January 1968, about 80 hours \nafter sunset. Second lunar day operations began at \n19:01 UT on 12 February 1968, and extended to \n00:24 UT on 21 February effectively ending the \nmission. In total, the five successful Surveyors \nreturned more than 87,000 photos of the lunar sur\xad\nface and operated for about 17 months total on the \nlunar surface, and most important, demonstrated \nthe feasibility of soft-landing a spacecraft on the \nlunar surface. Originally planned as a 7-spacecraft \nseries, in 1963, NASA added 3 more missions \n(Surveyors H, I, and J) for a total of 10 missions. \nThese later Surveyors, each weighing 1,134 kilo\xad\ngrams (as opposed to the 998-kilogram model), \nwere, however, canceled in December 1966 based \non the successful results of the Ranger missions, \nLunar Orbiters, and Surveyors already launched \nby\xa0then.', '74\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016\nfrom wreckage of the booster which was destroyed \nat T+97.4 seconds.\n90\nSurveyor VI\nNation: USA (41)\nObjective(s): lunar soft-landing\nSpacecraft: Surveyor-F\nSpacecraft Mass: 1,008.3 kg\nMission Design and Management: NASA / JPL\nLaunch Vehicle: Atlas Centaur (AC-14 / Atlas 3C no. \n5902C / Centaur D-1A)\nLaunch Date and Time: 7 November 1967 / 07:39:01 \nUT\nLaunch Site: Cape Kennedy / Launch Complex 36B\nScientific Instruments:\n1.\t TV camera\n2.\t alpha-scattering instrument\n3.\t footpad magnets\nResults: Surveyor VI landed safely on the Moon at \n01:01:04 UT on 10 November 1967 in the Sinus \nMedii (Central Bay) at coordinates announced as \n0.46° N / 1.37° W (but probably closer to 0.473° N / \n\n1.427° W). The spacecraft returned 29,952 images \nof the lunar surface during less than two weeks \nof operation before the onset of lunar night on \n24 November, because of which the spacecraft \nwas placed in hibernation mode on 26 November. \nDuring its initial operations, the alpha-scattering \ninstrument acquired about 30 hours of data on \nthe chemical composition of the lunar surface. \nAlthough controllers regained contact briefly on \n14\xa0 December 1967, primary landing operations \nhad ceased by this time. Before termination of \noperations, on 17 November 1967, Surveyor VI \nwas commanded to fire its three main liquid pro\xad\npellant thrusters for 2.5 seconds. As a result, the \nlander became the first spacecraft to be launched \nfrom the lunar surface. Surveyor VI lifted up to \nabout three meters before landing two-and-a-half \nmeters west of its original landing point.

The \ncapsule landed by parachute about 80 kilometers \nsouthwest of the town of Dzhezkazgan.

The \nparticles were expected to consist of a mixture of the ancient, pre-solar interstellar grains \nand nebular condensates that were frozen into comets at the far edges of the solar nebula \nduring the formation of the solar system. Mission success hinged on that objective.\nSecondary science objectives were to take 65 images of the comet’s nucleus within \n2,000 kilometers; to image the coma; to analyze particles in situ within the coma; \nand to collect and return 100 small, high-velocity, “new” interstellar particles from \na stream of “fresh” interstellar grains discovered entering the solar system from the \nsame direction as interstellar gas.81\nTertiary objectives—not critical but considered important by the team—were to \nmeasure certain aspects of the comet as the spacecraft flew through its coma. These \naspects included the coma dust flux, particle size distribution, integrated dust fluence, \nlarge particle momentum, and dust flux profiles over the spacecraft’s path. Another \ntertiary objective was to collect coma volatiles and perform in situ compositional \nanalyses of interplanetary dust particles, interstellar particles, and any other particle \ntypes encountered during the cometary flyby. To accomplish all this, the Stardust mis\xad\nsion was outfitted with a sample collector, a mass spectrometer, a dust detector, and a \nshared engineering optical navigation camera.82\nThe choice of comet, like all comet missions, was limited by those traveling through \nthe inner solar system at the projected time of encounter. This mission, however, also \nrequired the selection of a comet traveling slowly enough to allow Stardust to approach \nand eventually pass the comet, collecting samples as the speeds converged, limiting \nparticle fragmentation.

Instead mission planners adopted \nan alternate mission which required the probe’s \n(Thiokol TE-M-458) 35.8 kgf thrust retro-rocket to \nfire about 6.5 hours after launch. Under the new \nplan, the spacecraft was put into a highly elliptical \nEarth orbit of 449,174 × 30,550 kilometers at 28.9° \ninclination. In this orbit, Explorer XXXIII was high \nenough to be perturbed by the Moon’s gravitation. \nIn its new orbit, Explorer XXXIII approached the \nMoon (on its very first orbit) to a distance of 35,000 \nkilometers with subsequent close approaches in \nSeptember, November, and December 1966 vary\xad\ning from 40,000 to 60,000 kilometers. During this \ntime, the probe returned key data on Earth’s mag\xad\nnetic tail, the interplanetary magnetic field, and \nradiation.

The primary objective of Surveyor VII was a lunar soft-landing for a purely scientific mission outside of a potential landing site for the early Apollo flights. It successfully landed at 01:05:36.3 UT on 10 January 1968 on the ejecta blanket emanating from the bright Tycho crater in the south of the nearside. The results of its mission included taking 21,274 photographs, serving as a target for Earth-based lasers to accurately measure the distance between Earth and the Moon, and collecting 34 hours of alpha-scattering data during the first lunar day on three samples: the undisturbed lunar surface, a Moon rock, and an area dug up by the surface sampler. The scoop on the sampler’s arm was used numerous times for picking up soil and digging trenches, and for conducting at least 16 surface-bearing tests.

"Question: Why was there a lack of useful, analytical engineering base for helicopter investigations in the late 1920s and 1930s?","The lack of a useful, analytical engineering base for helicopter investigations in the late 1920s and 1930s was due to several factors. Firstly, the pioneers who built the first tentative full-scale rotary-wing aircraft did not understand aerodynamics very well, and they certainly all lacked special knowledge of the aerodynamics of vertical flight. Secondly, there was a huge problem of torque, the damaging effect produced by a fast-turning rotor when it forces the fuselage to rotate in the opposite direction from that of the engine. It would take years of research and development before engineers learned how to counteract rotor torque reaction successfully. Thirdly, the emergence of this modern engine that made it possible for aeronautical experimenters to build full-size models that were adequately powered also brought about the problem of vibrations, which could not be too serious. Lastly, the first significant application of aerodynamic theory to helicopter rotors did not come until sometime in the early 1920s. Prior to then, pure intuition guided the selection of rotor-blade forms and overall machine shapes.

However, the lack of a useful, analytical engineering base for helicopter investigations in the late 1920s and 1930s was also due to the fact that the noise signature of these unique devices was not well understood. The sound made by early rotary-wing aircraft was often criticized and ridiculed by the public, which made it difficult for proponents to gain support for their machines. Additionally, the noise of blade tip engines on jet-propelled helicopters was a problem of increasing concern in the 1950s, as it could be heard from several miles away. The ""blade slap"" sound characteristic of helicopters under certain flight conditions was also not anticipated and became a major design problem regarding wider, close-in public acceptance.

Overall, the lack of a useful, analytical engineering base for helicopter investigations in the late 1920s and 1930s was due to a combination of factors, including a lack of understanding of aerodynamics, problems with torque and vibrations, and the lack of understanding of the noise signature of these unique devices.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n36\npioneers had to contend with fits of “public head-shaking” implying that they were \n“foolish and mad to get involved in such a crazy idea” as a helicopter.12 Another \nillustration of helicopter state of the art in the early 1920s is manifest in Document \n5-33, a brief excerpt from Fred E. Weick’s autobiography, From the Ground Up. In \nit, Weick, then employed by the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, recalled his atten\xad\ndance at the first flight of a lateral rotor helicopter designed by Henry Berliner \n(the son of helicopter pioneer and inventor Emil Berliner), which took place at \nCollege Park, Maryland, in early 1924. (An earlier version of this same helicopter \nmade its first flight demonstration, also at College Park, in June 1922.) As Weick \nrecollected, the performance of Berliner’s machine “was better, I believe, than that \nby any other helicopter up to that time,” but its performance was still extremely \nlimited. Unable to fly free of ground effects (i.e., where the wake airflow was dis\xad\nturbed by its proximity to the ground), Berliner’s machine never lifted itself any \nhigher than about 15 feet. Weick, who would become a leader in NACA research \n(1925–29, 1930–36), seems to have passed no direct judgment on the helicopter at \nthe time, but it is clear from his reminiscence that in 1924, he felt that the design \nof helicopters had a very long way to go.\nStill, in the 1920s, enough progress \nwas being made in the rotary-wing field \nthat it was impossible for aeronautical \nleaders and establishments to ignore it. \nThe NACA, though it actively pursued \nlittle vertical-lift research at its Langley \nMemorial \nAeronautical \nLaboratory \nin the 1920s, published a consider\xad\nable number of papers on the subject, \nmany of them foreign (in translation). \nThese included papers by Achenbach \n(Technical Note 131, 1923), Wladimir \nMargoulis (TM 79, 1922), Oehmichen \n(TM 199, 1923), and von Kármán \n(TN\xa047, 1921), among others. Britain’s \nRoyal Aircraft Establishment treated the \ntopic of rotary-wing aircraft similarly, \ndoing not much more experimental \nwork than that conducted by the NACA. \nDocument 5-34 provides excerpts from \nthe second major NACA report on heli\xad\ncopters, which appeared in 1925, by the \n12\t Liberatore, Helicopters Before Helicopters, p. 161.Portrait of Alexander Klemin \nFIGURE 5.22.

Below this was the editorial comment:\nWhen a man of profound scientific wisdom has demonstrated with \nunassailable logic why a man could not fly, why should the public be \nfooled by silly stories about two bicycle repair men who have never been \nto college….\nSikorsky witnessed the initial flight demonstration of the Wright machine in \nEurope (France, 1908) and wrote in the same paper…“the impression and enthu\xad\nsiasm were tremendous.” With this demonstration the world accepted the airplane \nas here to stay. About 30 years later one could say the same about the helicopter.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the helicopter went through its own third and fourth \nstages of reaction. Such took the form of both personal and technical criticism. The \nlimited publicity on the Beach (1920) model dwelt on his novel approach to using \n“planetary engines” that whirled in circle-like gyroscopes. Editorial comment on \nthe idea concluded with the remark that apparently there was a “total eclipse” of \nthe system.\nExel, who worked on many variants (1920–1923) was considered a “nut” and \nchronic “tinkerer,” a typical character of that era. He married late, preferring to \nspend his time and funds (he ran a garage) courting the helicopter.\nDuring World War II helicopter development was at a low level. After the \nwar, American engineers could not dump the autogiro and deprecate its prominent \nengineers fast enough for the helicopter. This put the latter on the defensive, even \nthough they were not anti-helicopter. This technological drift was a resounding \nand lasting statement of the importance of hover capability. Enthusiasm peaked \nin the early 1950s when about 120 American companies and entrepreneurs were \ninvolved in its development. Today one could count 10 at most.\nAfter the war the author had conversations with the pioneer Isacco, then a resi\xad\ndent of Paris, and the Italian D’Ascanio, on their treatment in the early days, before \nthey were justified in their beliefs. Isacco was invited to the Soviet Union to build \na giant helicopter with a 24.4-meter (80 foot) diameter rotor, which he produced in \n1935. He was deported when construction was completed not knowing the fate of \nhis machine. Years later it was revealed the craft never flew, due to rotor problems.\nIn 1930 the D’Ascanio helicopter in Italy set a world record. After the war he \nvisited the United States to follow up on current helicopter activities. Considering \nthe vindication of belief in the helicopter, he was asked what bothered him most in \nthose early days. It was the public head-shaking in his presence, implying he was \nfoolish and mad to get involved in such a crazy idea. (His second problem was the \nconstant contention with the financial backers.)\nAnother aspect of the last two stages is the professional, or scientific approach \nto the helicopter.

The single-\nengined helicopter will have to include a variable-pitch mechanism in addition. The \nairplane engineer builds a structure which glides through the air, but with its parts \nstationary relative to one another. In the helicopter weight limitations and the flex\xad\nibility of a light, huge device will make all the mechanical problems of transmis\xad\nsion, etc., particularly difficult, and such difficulties militate against safety.\nThe future of the helicopter, unless it undergoes radical development, therefore \nlies not in competition with the airplane, but in its ability to perform certain func\xad\ntions which the airplane cannot undertake.\nBefore the complete development of a new mechanism of transportation, it \nis impossible to predict all the uses to which it may be put. It is doubtful whether \nthe Wrights foresaw the application of the airplane to fighting the boll weevil, or \nmaking air surveys for laying down power-transmission lines. By analogy, the heli\xad\ncopter, once it has been developed, may be utilized in ways quite unsuspected by \nus at present. There is no lack of plausible suggestions for its utilization. In military \nuse for observation purposes, to replace kite balloons or over areas where extremely \naccurate information is required; for securing communication between army units \nwhich cannot maintain airplane contact owing to topography; for accurate bomb\xad\ning of either land or sea objectives; for use in connection with naval vessels not sup\xad\nported by aircraft carriers. Enthusiastic supporters of the helicopter go so far as to \nsee it landing on roofs, bringing rapid communication to the very heart of cities and \nhelping to relieve traffic congestion—although airplanes with landing platforms \nmay more readily achieve this.\nAt any rate, the helicopter is within measurable distance of achievement, and is \nworthy of serious consideration.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n32\nAs interested as Edison was in electric motors, the key to the design of the \nfirst practical rotary-wing aircraft was in the development of small and lightweight \ninternal combustion engines. This was the critical invention that made it possible \nfor aeronautical experimenters to build full-size models that were adequately pow\xad\nered. But it was also with the emergence of this modern engine that devotees of \nvertical flight first encountered the huge problem of torque, the damaging effect \nproduced by a fast-turning rotor when it forces the fuselage to rotate in the opposite \ndirection from that of the engine. It would take years of research and development \nbefore engineers learned how to counteract rotor torque reaction successfully.\nAnother essential piece missing from the picture was a mature understanding \nof the nature of aerodynamic lift. The pioneers who had built the first tentative \nfull-scale rotary-wing aircraft did not understand aerodynamics very well, and they \ncertainly all lacked special knowledge of the aerodynamics of vertical flight. To the \nextent that relevant aerodynamic theory even existed, most of the pioneers were \noblivious to it. In his historical introduction to Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics \n(2000), J. Gordon Leishman, professor of aerospace engineering at the University \nof Maryland and former aerodynamicist at Westland Helicopters, noted that “the \nfirst significant application of aerodynamic theory to helicopter rotors” did not \ncome until sometime in the early 1920s. Prior to then, pure intuition guided the \nselection of rotor-blade forms and overall machine shapes. Aerodynamically, one of \nthe major results of this approach was “dissymmetry of lift,” the unequal or asym\xad\nmetric distribution of lift across the rotor disk owing to the difference in airflow \nvelocity over the advancing and retreating blades. It was this action that tended to \ncause the early helicopters to flip over on their sides.10\nAnd these were not the only problems retarding the effective design of heli\xad\ncopters and other types of rotary-wing aircraft in the early 1900s. Engineers had \nto find a way to keep down the weight of the engine and that of the rest of the \nstructure; otherwise, the machine would be too heavy to lift off with a pilot and any \nappreciable payload. Once the craft got airborne, it needed an effective means of \nstability and control. Additionally, vibrations could not be too serious. Here again, \naerodynamic knowledge, or the lack thereof, came into play, as it was an insuffi\xad\ncient understanding of the dynamic and aerodynamic behavior of rotating wings \nthat led to many failures—not just of rotors, but of airframes as well.\nDesigners overcame these problems very slowly. Four years after the Wright \nbrothers’ historic first powered flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the world’s \nfirst recorded free flight of a helicopter and pilot was made when Frenchman Paul \nCornu, on 13 November 1907, lifted his twin-rotored machine a few feet into the \nair for a few seconds. It lifted up with no assistance from the ground, but it did take \na team of ground handlers with sticks to stabilize it once it became even slightly \n10\t J.

The first NACA report on helicopters was released in 1920 (Technical \nNote\xa04). Aside from other reports on European activities, this document was fol\xad\nlowed by one in 1925 by Alexander Klemin. The author was an early proponent of \nthe helicopter and an early educator on the subject. Within this time interval, the \nonly testing at NACA involved a propeller-type rotor in forward flight. All helicop\xad\nter work was dropped with the advent of the autogiro in the early 1920s, but it was \nrevived in the 1940s. Practically all the basic helicopter theory and testing emerged \nfrom work by this organization.\nIn general, the criticism directed at mechanical flight in the 19th century was \nnot differentiated. But there was divergence toward the end of the century and into \nthe next one. Certainly the drift was due to the positive progress with the fixed \nwing principle. In contrast rotary wing proponents still had to endure criticism and \napparently rely mostly on faith that the machine could be made practical.\nConsidering the variety of prototype flying machines and their powerplants, \ncomment is sparse on the noise signature such devices make, something that \nbecomes very evident even to its creator on the first runup of these unique devices. \nNoise pattern can be reviewed from both historical and contemporary aspects. The \nlatter is a problem of increasing concern.\nNoise as a positive value was mentioned in conjunction with James Watt. \nChalmers (1908) vividly described the sound of his rotor system. A contraption that \nlooked suspect to begin with could easily sway public to ridicule by the sound it \nmade. The notion of unanticipated acoustical phenomena extended into the 1950s \nwhen blade tip engines on jet-propelled helicopters were first run up. In one case \nthe noise of a two-seat pulsejet helicopter with its tip-mounted (buzz bomb) engines \ncould be heard about 7 kilometers (6 miles) away. The pulsejet emitted an organ-\ntrumpet sound while the ramjet produced a high pitch sound due to the high tip \nspeeds necessary for operation.\nWith the modern, tail rotor helicopter one could anticipate the tail rotor noise \nbecause it is a kind of propeller. But it is unlikely anyone expected the “blade slap” \nsound characteristic of helicopters under certain flight conditions. Blade slap is \ndue to rapid air pressure variations on the main rotor blades. The phenomenon is \nstrongest (loudest) when the helicopter is descending in its own wake (air vortices), \nparticularly in the 113–145 km/h (70–90 mph) speed range. However the slap is \nnot always very loud. The movie Apocalypse Now had a long helicopter sequence \nfeaturing as much blade slap as helicopters. As suggested above, helicopter noise has \nbecome a major design problem regarding wider, close-in public acceptance.\nThe specifics described immediately above do not suggest the underlying social \nview of science and technology that is spotted throughout this book. 19th century \nattitudes were highly favorable of their benefits, ignoring the human consequences. \nA general optimism and faith that science and technology could solve all problems \nwas strong in America in the last half of that century. Aspects of the view are']","
The lack of a useful, analytical engineering base for helicopter investigations in the late 1920s and 1930s can be attributed to two main reasons. Firstly, the fixed-wing approach to mechanical flight, as demonstrated by the Wrights, overshadowed helicopter investigations. This made helicopters seem like a machine with a questionable future, given their unsuccessful past. Secondly, there was no useful, analytical engineering theory on concepts such as performance and stability. This lack of theory was recognized by Chanute in 1894 and applied to helicopters until the late 1920s and 1930s. The absence of a theory made it difficult to know what was important in observations and to identify rational avenues of research. Additionally, individuals who could contribute to this field were more interested in fixed-wing principles. A corollary to this explanation is the general absence of analytical sophistication in this particular field, with invention, intuition, and accident being the primary ways of creativity."
Question: What is the opinion of the Director of Civil Aviation regarding the use of autogiros in taking-off and landing in a dead beat fashion?,"The Director of Civil Aviation, Sir Sefton Brancker, had sent a very kind letter, in which he asked what would be the behaviour of the autogiro on the occasion of these hair-raising bumps which sometimes happened. He was sorry that his pilot had not answered that question, because he has had some experience of that. He was flying through Germany last year in an autogiro accompanied by the Secretary of the Autogiro Company, who was undergoing his first flying experience. They were nearly thrown out of their seats by a terrific bump, the machine falling 500 feet. The wings became horizontal for a moment; but after a few seconds everything became normal and nothing happened. As a matter of fact, it might be interesting to state that the autogiro behaves in bumps better than the aeroplane, due to the flexibility of its lifting means.

The Chairman asked me what other self-starting methods than the system of the deflected tail were being contemplated. There were many possibilities of a self-starter with an autogiro. The obvious conventional solution would be a direct mechanical drive from the engine, and that solution was being tested at the present time.

The autogiro can, with proper handling, be landed in perfectly still air with no run at all after touching the ground. In steep descent of about forty-five degrees the vertical speed of the latest machines is not more than 12 to 13 feet per second.

The secondary development stage has now arrived where the co-operation of aircraft constructors generally can be justifiably asked and the scope of the work broadened by the participation in it of the aircraft industry whose constructional knowledge and genius have not hitherto been available.

The autogiro can practically do everything the helicopter is supposed to do. Take off in ten to twenty yards, forty to fifty degrees steepness of climb, eighteen miles an hour minimum horizontal speed or ten miles an hour when losing altitude at seven or eight feet per second, in addition to the vertical descent and dead stop landing qualities, would constitute performances which, while not strictly those of the theoretical helicopter, could yet be obtained immediately and would, in practice, open for such a machine all the possibilities of a helicopter.

The autogiro fails \nto solve half the problem \nsince, while it makes possi\xad\nble landing in a small space, \nit does not permit a velocity \nzero while the take-off and \nall other performances con\xad\nnected with the climb char\xad\nacteristics are less favorable. \nAs regards weight, there is \nno essential disadvantage. \nOn the contrary, particu\xad\nlarly in large designs, the \nreduction in weight caused \nby the use of lifting surfaces free from forces due to pressure and extended by the \ncentrifugal forces should more than offset the heavy propeller hub and starting \ngear. This is a very valuable property of all rotating-wing aircraft and hence also of \nB) HELICOPTERS\nwhich we shall now consider. In regard to the question of weight we must still \nmake the greatest sacrifice, probably the only one in the future. The gears must \ntransmit to the propellers with sufficient reliability the full maximum power of the \nengines, a circumstance which in the case of small aircraft puts the helicopter at a \ndisadvantage as compared with the conventional airplane. Breguet has computed \na helicopter of 16 tons gross weight and claims to have found a saving in weight as \ncompared with the corresponding airplane. Although this appears too optimistic, \nit may be stated roughly that with increasing size of aircraft the proportion of the \nweight taken up by the drive gear will be reduced sharply as compared with the \nweights very small due to absence of pressure forces of the lifting parts.\nAs regards the maximum velocity the question arises at the very beginning \nwhether it is advantageous to have a given rotating-wing aircraft operate as an auto\xad\ngiro or as a helicopter, that is, without propulsive propeller. For it is conceivable that \nour initial requirements would be met if the helicopter in high-speed flight would \noperate as an autogiro or in some intermediate state. This important question we Graph with forward speed on the x-axis and power required on the y-axis. It gives a comparison of required and available power of conventional airplane and autogiro.The autogiro needs more power at lower speeds but can function at lower speeds.\nFIGURE 4.

When on the ground the system by which the windmill supports \nthe machine in the air tends to create misgivings in the mind of the would-be pilot; \nbut the moment it gets into the air the system seems to be perfectly logical and \ndependable, and after a few minutes’ handling the pilot experiences a feeling of \ncomplete confidence—at least that was his experience.\nHe felt that at present their efforts should be specially devoted towards improv\xad\ning the take-off. Some time ago, Mr. de la Cierva promised he would produce a \nfour-seater machine which would take-off in any wind from the Horse Guards \nParade. The rate of climb, of course, is less than that of the aeroplane; but the \nclimb is much steeper and the forward speed much slower, a fact which many \npeople are apt to forget. Thus, even in its present state of development they can \nsay that its ability to get out of an enclosed area is distinctly better than that of the \naverage\xa0aeroplane.\nHe would strongly recommend the fitting of a geared propeller to an autogiro \nas soon as possible.\nHe would like to ask Mr. de la Cierva one question. When flying in bad weather \na heavy downward current is sometimes experienced in which an aeroplane will \ndrop like a stone 400 or 500 feet; gravity ceases to work; the engines stop owing \nto the cessation of gravity feed; and the passengers and hand baggage fly up to the \nroof and remain suspended until the end of the bump. What would an autogiro do \nunder such conditions?\nREPLY TO DISCUSSION\nSenor [sic] J. De La Cierva: Sir Sefton Brancker, the Director of Civil Aviation, \nhad sent a very kind letter, in which he asked what would be the behaviour of the \nautogiro on the occasion of these hair-raising bumps which sometimes happened. \nHe was sorry that his pilot had not answered that question, because he has had \nsome experience of that. He was flying through Germany last year in an autogiro \naccompanied by the Secretary of the Autogiro Company, who was undergoing his \nfirst flying experience. They were nearly thrown out of their seats by a terrific \nbump, the machine falling 500 feet. The wings became horizontal for a moment; \nbut after a few seconds everything became normal and nothing happened. As a \nmatter of fact, it might be interesting to state that the autogiro behaves in bumps \nbetter than the aeroplane, due to the flexibility of its lifting means.\nThe Chairman asked me what other self-starting methods than the system \nof the deflected tail were being contemplated. There were many possibilities of \na self-starter with an autogiro. The obvious conventional solution would be a \ndirect mechanical drive from the engine, and that solution was being tested at the', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n562\nit would be justified) an over-powered autogiro, in which only load would be sac\xad\nrificed, could practically do everything the helicopter is supposed to do. Take off \nin ten to twenty yards, forty to fifty degrees steepness of climb, eighteen miles an \nhour minimum horizontal speed or ten miles an hour when losing altitude at seven \nor eight feet per second, in addition to the vertical descent and dead stop landing \nqualities, would constitute performances which, while not strictly those of the theo\xad\nretical helicopter, could yet be obtained immediately and would, in practice, open \nfor such a machine all the possibilities of a helicopter. To my mind, the autogiro \ncould be classified in two categories: The autogiro-aeroplanes, with performances \ncomparable with those of the ordinary aeroplanes in speed and climb and relatively \nlow powered, and the autogiro-helicopters. There is, of course, no definite point of \ndivision between both.\nBefore ending this paper, I must say once more that the autogiro is still suscep\xad\ntible to considerable development and improvement. At the same time it is already \na thoroughly practical machine, and in the very near future it will be, I hope, a still \nbetter one.\nThe secondary development stage has now arrived where the co-operation of \naircraft constructors generally can be justifiably asked and the scope of the work \nbroadened by the participation in it of the aircraft industry whose constructional \nknowledge and genius have not hitherto been available.\nI want to take advantage of this meeting to thank publicly all who have helped \nthe development of the autogiro in this country, where I have carried out most \nof my work for the past four years. To my friends and collaborators, to the Air \nMinistry, to the Royal Aeronautical Society and even to my critics, I feel I am very \nmuch in debt.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Chairman: He thought they would agree that the lecturer had put forward \na frank and moderately clear account of the present position, and a series of reason\xad\nable claims for future research leading to the production of what he termed the \nsmaller size autogiro. Since these developments were commenced four-and-a-half \nyears ago, under the control of the Director of Scientific Research—who would \nopen the discussion—the slotted wing had become more or less a standard fitment \non ordinary aircraft. Therefore, the advantage that the autogiro offered at the time \nthat it was first taken up in England had to some extent been modified, in that it \ndid not, to the slotted wing machine, offer the same degree of extra safety that it \noffered to a machine not fitted with the slots. He absolutely agreed with Senor [sic] \nde la Cierva when he said that his machine, with a suitable power weight ratio, \ncould do in a practical manner all that it was claimed the helicopter could do.\nThey all admitted that safety was one of the most important considerations; \nbut how much safer was the autogiro than the slotted wing aeroplane? They wanted', '531\nDocument 5-35\nbut the rotating blades will sustain it in the air and enable it to alight at a very \nlow\xa0speed.\nCalculations, the details of which need not be given here, lead to the encourag\xad\ning conclusion that, in the least favorable case, when an accident to the pilot leaves \nthe aircraft without control, the collision with the ground would be similar to that \nof a fall of a little over two feet, instead of the break-neck horizontal speeds at which \nairplanes now land. The “Autogiro” will land, in the least favorable case, at a speed \nof less than 7.5 miles per hour.\nThe stalling of the engine while in flight over ground which is rough or cov\xad\nered with vegetation, though fatal to an airplane, will only be a mishap of minor \nimportance to an “Autogiro.” On the other hand, it will probably be unable to do \nany looping or other stunts, like fighting airplanes. It will be a commercial aircraft, \nwith which it will not be possible to bring down enemy airplanes, nor give danger\xad\nous exhibitions of useless daring.\nThese constitute two excellent qualities in addition to that of safety in case of \nloss of speed and its ability to alight slowly and vertically.\nTranslated by \nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.', '553\nDocument 5-36 (a–b)\nhe had learned to fly) he had been the pilot. Of the fourteen types which had been \nproduced recently in this and other countries, the inventor and designer, Senor [sic] \nde la Cierva, had himself made all the first tests; so he at least had absolute confi\xad\ndence in his own invention.\nTHE AUTOGIRO BY\nJ. DE LA CIERVA\n(INGENIERO DE CAMINOS, CANALES Y PUERTOS E INGENIERO \nDE CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICAS)\nI have, for the second time, the honour of addressing you. Four years ago I \ntold you how I had had the good fortune to discover a new method of flying with \ncharacteristics altogether different from the conventional aeroplane.\nTo-day, taking advantage of your kind invitation, I come to tell you of how \nthe crude experimental autogiros of 1925 have been developed into practical flying \nmachines. I will also deal with a number of theoretical points in justification of the \nassertions I have often made about the qualities of the autogiro and in answer to the \ncriticisms of which my system has been made the object from time to time.\nI have, at the risk of giving the impression of not understanding my own dis\xad\ncovery, preferred to remain practically silent for years, giving only expression to my \nfaith in the future. I was waiting to have enough experimental evidence to check \nmy theories, which I have not had until quite recently, because of the secondary \ndifficulties which make any development of this kind so slow and painful. A double \nsimultaneous investigation, aerodynamical and mechanical, has been necessary to \nbring the autogiro to the present stage, which, of course, only represents an inter\xad\nmediate degree of improvement.\nThe autogiros lately produced have no better performance than the equivalent \nconventional aeroplanes. In fact, they have a little less speed and a little less climb \nthan the best equivalent aeroplanes. Nevertheless, they are better flying machines. \nIf they still fall a little short of the best aeroplanes in that rather vague quality which \nis called “performances” they have a performance of their own, which is utility \nand\xa0safety.\nThe comparison in performance between existing autogiros of several types \nand best equivalent aeroplanes can be summed up as follows: Top speed, five to \nten per cent. less. Rate of climb, twenty per cent. less. Steepness of climb, fifty per \ncent. more. Minimum horizontal speed, fifty per cent. less. The take-off since the \nintroduction of the deflector tail is better. The landing qualities are so well known \nthat it is hardly necessary for me to mention them. In any case, I want to state that \nthe present day autogiro can, with proper handling, be landed in perfectly still air \nwith no run at all after touching the ground. In steep descent of about forty-five \ndegrees the vertical speed of the latest machines is not more than 12 to 13 feet per']","
The Director of Civil Aviation is still a convinced user of the autogiro and feels that they are on the brink of making a real practical use of that type of machine. He finds the autogiro to be an interesting and comfortable machine to fly, and even in its present state of development, he appreciates its ability to make extremely bad landings with impunity. He specifically recommends improving the take-off of autogiros and suggests the fitting of a geared propeller as soon as possible. He also mentions that autogiros have a better ability to get out of an enclosed area compared to average aeroplanes due to their slower forward speed and steeper climb angle."
What was the original rationale behind the X-planes and how did it change over time?,"The original rationale behind the X-planes was to explore a flight regime that the NACA's wind tunnels could not simulate. However, by the time the X-15 and D-558-2 Skyrocket flew, researchers had figured out how to extend ground test facilities into this realm with the slotted-throat wind tunnel, developed by Richard Whitcomb at Langley in the early 1950s. Therefore, the real value of the research airplanes lay in the comparison of the ground-based tests with actual flight results to validate theories and wind tunnel results. Through this effort, a difficult transonic zone had been reduced to an ordinary engineering problem.

The X-15 program, operated by NASA between 1959 and 1968, built on the successes of the X-1 and D-558-2 Skyrocket. The X-15's designers anticipated that their biggest problem would be the intense heat that the aircraft would encounter due to the friction of air over its skin. The upper fuselage would reach temperatures over 460 degrees Fahrenheit, but other parts of the aircraft would reach temperatures of a whopping 1,230 degrees F, and the nose would reach a temperature of 1,240 degrees F. Designers chose to use a high-temperature alloy known as Inconel X, which, unlike most materials, remained strong at high temperatures.

The X-15 first flew on 8 June 1959 on a glide flight. It was dropped from under the wing of a specially modified B-52 ""mother ship."" The first powered flight took place on 17 September. Once the X-15 fell clear of the B-52, pilot Scott Crossfield ignited the rocket engine and flew to a relatively pokey Mach .79. On future flights, the X-15 flew many times the speed of sound. The X-15 continued flying until 24 October 1968. In all, the program's three aircraft made a total of 199 flights, establishing many records.

One of the storied pilots of the X-15 program was Joe Walker. Through 25 flights behind the controls of the X-15, Walker had many famous moments. He reached","['NACA to NASA to Now\n50\nThe X-1 program represented a major success for the NACA in its postwar \nefforts. Thereafter, the NACA joined the Air Force to pursue ever greater speeds \nin the X-1A, X-1B, and X-1E. This research led to the interceptor built for North \nAmerican defense by Lockheed, the F-104 “Starfighter.” It took six years after \nthe X-1 supersonic flight before NACA test pilot A.\xa0Scott Crossfield exceeded \nMach 2 in the jet-powered D-558-2 Skyrocket—in an NACA partnership with \nthe Navy—on 20 November 1953. Only three years after that, on 7 September \n1956, Air Force Captain Milburn G. Apt was killed during his first X-2 flight \nafter he reached Mach 3.196 (1,701 mph), becoming the first person to fly at \nthree times the speed of sound. \nThe original rationale behind the X-planes had been to explore a flight \nregime that the NACA’s wind tunnels could not simulate. However, by the \ntime the X-1 and D-558 flew, researchers had figured out how to extend ground \ntest facilities into this realm with the slotted-throat wind tunnel, developed \nby Richard Whitcomb at Langley in the early 1950s. Therefore, the real value \nof the research airplanes lay in the comparison of the ground-based tests with \nactual flight results to validate theories and wind tunnel results. The fact that \nthe first transonic flights showed nothing particularly unexpected—dispelling \nthe myth of a sound barrier—was of great relief to the researchers. Through this \neffort, a difficult transonic zone had been reduced to an ordinary engineering \nproblem. Although few people were thinking about it at the time, the results \nfrom these experiments would also be instrumental in developing spaceplanes \nsuch as the Space Shuttle.\nThe next step was to push through the so-called thermal barrier predicted \nby legendary aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán and others. Although not \nrelated to specific velocity like the speed of sound, vehicles venturing above \nMach 5 (hypersonic velocities) experienced significantly increased heating \nrates from friction that appeared to present a substantial problem. Between the \ntwo world wars, hypersonics had been an area of theoretical interest to a small \ngroup of researchers, but little progress was made in defining the possible prob\xad\nlems and even less toward solving them. The major constraint was propulsion. \nEngines, even the rudimentary rockets then being experimented with, were \nincapable of propelling any significant object to hypersonic velocities. Wind \ntunnels also lacked the power to generate such speeds. Computer power to \nsimulate the environment using models, what is now known as computational \nfluid dynamics, had not as yet even been imagined.\nHypersonic research was authorized primarily to support the massive effort \nassociated with developing intercontinental missiles. One researcher interested \nin exploring the new science of hypersonics was John V. Becker at NACA \nLangley. On 3 August 1945, Becker proposed the construction of a new type', 'Captive-Carry, Ground Tow, and Planned Powered Testing\n229\nall characteristics in a particular part of the flight envelope should be \nachieved simultaneously; the program will have reduced risks, but will \nrequire a large number of flights; and the methodology also applies to \nthe individual subsystems. \n•\t Autonomous Vehicles: The advantage of an autonomous vehicle is \nthat it allows the designer to do things that would not be tolerated if \nflown by a human pilot. The disadvantage is that a pilot has the abil\xad\nity to feel the plane and adapt to its characteristics. For example, a \npilot can attempt to recover from an unanticipated problem while an \nautopilot simply performs the maneuvers it is programed to execute. \nAccordingly, the X-34 was required to have a high degree of mission \nflexibility, thus requiring a high degree of robustness of the autopilot. \n•\t Limited Test Time: The X-34 would have had very limited time \non each flight to perform dedicated testing. This is due to having \na low lift-to-drag ratio resulting in high rates of descent, and to the \nvehicles high degree of power, which once extinguished could not be \nrestarted. For unpowered flights the X-34 would have had approxi\xad\nmately 90\xa0seconds of dedicated test time between drop time and the \nacquisition of the glide slope. For powered flights, the flight condi\xad\ntions would have changed so rapidly that the X-34 could neither fly \nat a constant Mach number or dynamic pressure during ascent or \nreentry. After separation from the carrier aircraft, the vehicle would \nneed to pull up to maintain a normal acceleration of 2.0 g until reach\xad\ning a designated flight path angle. This maneuver was designed as \na compromise between high dynamic pressures and aero loads and \nwould have provided no room for anything other than carry along \nexperiments. During reentry, the X-34 would have been limited by an \nangle of attack profile that would have provided adequate temperature \nprotection, but only subtle changes to these profiles could have been \nmade during these two phases of flight, thus limiting the remainder of \nthe flight to performing dynamic maneuvers or experiments.16 \n•\t Binary Systems: X-34 binary systems included the main propulsion \nsystem, flight controls, flight termination system, and separation from \nthe carrier aircraft. All of these would have needed to work well on the \nfirst use in order prevent loss of the vehicle. This would have required \nadequate ground testing and/or analysis to be performed on each sys\xad\ntem. Also, as many of these systems as feasible should be tested while \nthe vehicle is in captive-carry in order to reduce the risk of losing \nthe\xa0vehicle.17 \n•\t Airspace Constraints: Operational airspace should be a by-product \nof the required mission and not a limitation imposed on good test', 'The Power for Flight\n50\nCleveland. Fundamental research into fluid mechanics, heat transfer, instru\xad\nment and computing research, and radiation physics constituted 24 percent \nof the laboratory’s efforts. Finally, air-breathing engine research in support \nof advanced military projects such as the North American XB-70 Valkyrie \nlong-range supersonic nuclear bomber and its GE J93 engines represented \nonly 7\xa0percent.3\nCrossing the Hypersonic Frontier: The X-15\nNASA continued the high-speed programs of the NACA in the form of the \nX-15 flight research program (1959–1968), which investigated hypersonic \nflight at five or more times the speed of sound at altitudes reaching into space. \nLaunched from the wing of a Boeing B-52 mother ship, the X-15 was a true \n“aerospace” plane with performance that went well beyond the capabilities \nof existing aircraft powered by air-breathing engines within and beyond the \natmosphere. North American Aviation of Los Angeles, CA, had a special chal\xad\nlenge in designing the X-15. For propulsion, a Reaction Motors XLR99 rocket \nengine produced 57,000 pounds of thrust. At hypersonic speeds, the air trav\xad\neling over an airplane generated enough friction and heat that the outside \nsurface of the airplane reached a temperature of 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. \nNorth American used titanium as the primary structural material and covered \nit with a new, high-temperature nickel alloy called Inconel-X. The X-15 relied \nupon conventional controls in the atmosphere but used reaction-control jets \nto maneuver in space. The long, black research airplane, with its distinguishing \ncruciform tail, became the highest-flying airplane in history. In August 1963, \nthe X-15 flew to 67 miles (354,200 feet) above Earth at a speed of Mach 6.7, \nor 4,534 miles per hour. Overall, the 199 flights of X-15 program generated \nimportant data on high-speed flight and provided valuable lessons for NASA’s \nspace program.4 The use of rocket power to propel an air-launched aircraft into \nthe hypersonic range was successful, but it also illustrated the need for other \nforms of propulsion for practical high-speed flight.\nNASA’s Participation in the National \nSST Program, 1961–1971\nNASA’s work in high-speed commercial aviation, centering on ever-faster \nairliners, culminated with the ill-fated supersonic transport (SST). With the \nsubsonic jet airliner an everyday technology in the 1960s, the next step was \nbuilding an SST. Achieving supersonic commercial flight in the 1960s was \nviewed by many as the next logical triumph of American civil aviation, proof \nof the United States’ enduring technological superiority in aerospace. America', 'Chapter 4:\u2002 Higher, Faster, and Farther\n49\npunished by being ordered to attend the myriad X-1 technical meetings, where \nhe was out of his depth in terms of engineering knowledge.\nRegardless, Chuck Yeager made history in this program on 14 October \n1947, when he became the first human to fly faster than the sound barrier in \nlevel flight. On that date the Bell X-1 achieved Mach 1.06—about 700 miles \nper hour—at 43,000 feet. This success was not predicated on any miraculous \nengineering innovation; knowledge of how this might be achieved had been \nhoned to a high art before World War II, and it rested fundamentally on the \nrocket propulsion system that could propel the X-1 beyond the speed of sound. \nContrary to popular conceptions, moreover, there was no sense from anyone \nthat this could not be achieved; the U.S. Air Force was committed to building \nsupersonic fighters as an edge over the Soviet Union, and aeronautical research\xad\ners knew beyond any doubt that no absolute barrier to supersonic flight existed. \nThis might explain the matter-of-fact statement of Chuck Yeager about what \nwas accomplished on 14 October, when he addressed a conclave of aeronautical \nprofessionals in 1956: “We looked at our data and I pretty well had the flight \nplan down perfect, which was the most important.”5 That statement bespoke \nnone of the excitement that has come to symbolize that day. Yeager compen\xad\nsated later: “Climbing faster than you can even think…. You’ve never known \nsuch a feeling of speed while pointing up in the sky…. God, what a ride!”6 In \nall, the NACA/Air Force team made more than 80 flights with the X-1 before \nthe conclusion of the program after 157 flights in 1951. \nThere are some who have claimed that Yeager was not the first human to fly \nfaster than the speed of sound. At the same time that the X-1 research program \nwas under way at Muroc, North American Aviation’s chief test pilot, George \n“Wheaties” Welch, was engaged in flight tests of the XP-86—later to become \nthe legendary F-86 fighter—at the Muroc North Base test facility operated by \nthe Air Force. Welch made the first flight of the XP-86 on 1 October 1947, and \nsome personnel claimed at the time and since that Welch flew faster than the \nspeed of sound almost two weeks before Yeager in the X-1. Others, such as X-1 \nchase plane pilot Bob Hoover, have refuted those claims because the XP-86 was \nunderpowered and needed a new engine in its production models to achieve \nsupersonic flight. The highest Mach number reached by Welch in 1947, as indi\xad\ncated by official flight test records, was .93 during a power dive from 45,114\xa0feet \nflown on 13 November. Nothing conclusive existed supporting Welch’s fly\xad\ning supersonic before Yeager despite some who claimed to hear a sonic boom. \nThe XP-86 did achieve supersonic flight—after being re-engined—on 26 April \n1948. NACA aerodynamicist Walt Williams, who was working on the X-1 pro\xad\ngram, responded best when confronted with this claim, “show me the data.”7 \nNo one ever has.', 'Chapter 4:\u2002 Higher, Faster, and Farther\n53\nover 4,000 wind tunnel hours were devoted to finalizing the configuration for \nwhat became the X-15. \nX-15: Pushing the Boundaries\nThe X-15 would not fly until 1959, just at the point that the NACA was trans\xad\nformed into NASA, but there was a lot of preliminary work undertaken in the \n1950s to make that program a success. No question, the quest for speed and \naltitude took a bold leap forward with the X-15 program, operated by NASA \nbetween 1959 and 1968. The NASA-USAF program built three X-15 test vehi\xad\ncles with a long fuselage, short stubby wings, and an unusual tail configura\xad\ntion. A Reaction Motors, Inc., XLR99 rocket engine generating 57,000 pounds \n(253,549 newtons) of thrust powered the aircraft. This engine used ammonia \nand liquid oxygen for propellant and hydrogen peroxide to drive the high-speed \nturbopump that pumped fuel into the engine. Because the X-15 would operate \nin extremely thin air at high altitudes, conventional mechanisms for controlling \nthe aircraft were insufficient, and the aircraft was equipped with small rocket \nengines in its nose for steering. \nThe X-15’s designers anticipated that their biggest problem would be the \nintense heat that the aircraft would encounter due to the friction of air over its \nskin. The upper fuselage would reach temperatures over 460 degrees Fahrenheit \n(F). But other parts of the aircraft would reach temperatures of a whopping \n1,230 degrees F, and the nose would reach a temperature of 1,240 degrees F. \nDesigners chose to use a high-temperature alloy known as Inconel X, which, \nunlike most materials, remained strong at high temperatures. \nThe X-15 first flew on 8 June 1959 on a glide flight. It was dropped from \nunder the wing of a specially modified B-52 “mother ship.” The first pow\xad\nered flight took place on 17 September. Once the X-15 fell clear of the B-52, \npilot Scott Crossfield ignited the rocket engine and flew to a relatively pokey \nMach\xa0.79. On future flights the X-15 flew many times the speed of sound. The \nX-15 continued flying until 24 October 1968. In all, the program’s three air\xad\ncraft made a total of 199 flights, establishing many records.\nOne of the storied pilots of the X-15 program was Joe Walker. Through 25 \nflights behind the controls of the X-15, Walker had many famous moments. \nHe reached 4,104\xa0mph (Mach 5.92) during Flight 59 on 27 June 1962. He also \nmade three X-15 flights into suborbital space, 62 miles. The first was Flight 90 \non 19 July 1963 to 66 miles in altitude, and the second, Flight 91 on 22 August \n1963 at 67 miles. He then flew more, setting an unofficial world altitude record \nof 354,200 feet, or 67.08 miles, on 22 August 1963. This marked the highest \naltitude ever flown in the X-15.']","
The original rationale behind the X-planes was to explore a flight regime that the NACA’s wind tunnels could not simulate. However, by the time the X-1 and D-558 flew, researchers had figured out how to extend ground test facilities into this realm with the slotted-throat wind tunnel. Therefore, the real value of the research airplanes lay in the comparison of the ground-based tests with actual flight results to validate theories and wind tunnel results. The focus then shifted to pushing through the so-called thermal barrier predicted by Theodore von Kármán and others, which was a significant problem for vehicles venturing above Mach 5 due to increased heating rates from friction. This research was primarily authorized to support the development of intercontinental missiles."
Question: How does the use of a special test battery aid in identifying the causes of disruptions in various forms of eye movements during spaceflight?,"The use of a special test battery, such as the Computerized method of preventing and correcting unfavorable perception and sensorimotor reactions, aids in identifying the causes of disruptions in various forms of eye movements during spaceflight by providing a unique approach to the training of patients depending on their disease and selecting the most effective means of training using biofeedback. This method has been actively used during prolonged spaceflight aboard the ISS since 2013 and has demonstrated effectiveness in diagnosing conditions of the vestibular and its related sensory systems, as well as in assessing the stability of static and dynamic spatial orientation on Earth. The suppression of negative reactions during flight using the fixation reflex has been successfully applied by crew members aboard the ISS since 2013. The non-pharmacological computerized method for treating and preventing vertigo, dizziness, and equilibrium disturbances was tested in clinical conditions and demonstrated that patients acquired the capacity to fixate on and hold their gaze on both real and imagined targets, thus suppressing vertigo, dizziness, nystagmus, and equilibrium disturbances. The effectiveness of training depended not only on the disorder but also on the type of training selected. For patients with peripheral vestibulopathies, the most effective was visual training; for patients with central vestibulopathies, the vestibular method was the best option; and for patients with psychogenic vestibulopathies, the combined method was preferred. Analysis of special questionnaires demonstrated that all patients with psychogenic, 91% of patients with peripheral, and 80% of patients with central vestibulopathies subjectively noted ""good suppression of vertigo in everyday conditions"" and ""improvement in general adaptation to real life conditions.""","['175Photo of a man laying on a table.

During the testing under differing \nconditions, movements of the eyes (by electro- and \nvideo- oculography) and the head (using angular rate \nsensors and accelerometers) are recorded.\nThe eye-movement system is controlled by a complex \nhierarchy of innervation mechanisms located at different \nlevels of the nervous system. The use of a special test \nbattery makes it possible to evaluate the disruptions \nthat are occurring in various forms of eye movements \nand, given the known mechanisms of how these \nmovements are performed, to find the causes of \nthese disturbances.\nThis method has been actively used during prolonged \nspaceflight aboard the ISS in a space experiment called \nVirtual since 2013, and after crew members return to \nEarth during Sensory Adaptation study since 2001.\nRecent studies have shown that repeated spaceflight \nleads to a dramatic, statistically significant reduction in \nthe duration of postflight re-adaptation with significantly \nless severe vestibular disorders. Cosmonauts with \na prior experience of being in microgravity had \nsignificantly changed vestibular reactions only on return \nplus 1 to 2 days postflight whereas cosmonauts who \nwere in long-term spaceflight for the first time had \nsymptoms of space motion sickness and vestibular \ndisorders up to return plus 8 to 9 days postflight.\nThe procedure and hardware/software systems \ndeveloped for spaceflight have also demonstrated \neffectiveness of the computerized method and \nhardware/software systems for use in diagnosing \nconditions of the vestibular and its related sensory \nsystems (primarily visual), as well as in assessing the \nstability of static and dynamic spatial orientation on \nEarth. The systems have particularly been useful in \nexperiments simulating weightlessness (i.e., immersion \nand bed rest), in examining highly qualified athletes \n(e.g., high-performance sports: gymnastics, figure \nand speed skating, target shooting, etc.), in diagnosing \nand treating patients who are suffering from dizziness \nand equilibrium disturbances, and in evaluating the \neffectiveness of medications (i.e., betahistine drugs \nBetaver and Betaserc).

Such application in clinical practice has \nmade it possible to develop diagnostic criteria to \ndetermine the type of vestibular disturbance, while \noffering a rapid, less-expensive initial differential \ndiagnosis of dizziness and balance disturbances \ncompared to traditional clinical testing.\nSpace Research Leads to Non-\npharmacological Treatment and \nPrevention of Vertigo, Dizziness \nand Equilibrium disturbances\nThe history of spaceflight has shown that initial \nintroduction to the weightlessness environment, \nsuch as that of the ISS, can lead to space motion \nsickness, which makes crew members feel dizzy and \nuncoordinated, and even impacting their ability to track \nobjects with their eyes. The result can be a negative \neffect both on the health of crew members and on \nthe quality of their work performance during flight.\nAt present, medications are typically used to eliminate \nthe symptoms of space motion sickness; however, \nthese medications come with contraindications and \nside effects that can have a negative effect on various \ntypes of professional activity.

Assessment of eye movement reactions of cosmonauts, preflight and postflight, has led to \nfaster and less-expensive diagnoses and treatment of patients suffering from vertigo, dizziness and \nequilibrium disturbances. A patented computerized, non-pharmacological method of preventing and \ncorrecting unfavorable perception and sensorimotor reactions is used to train patients and astronauts \nto acquire the ability to suppress vertigo, dizziness and equilibrium disturbances.\nA system of hardware and software that collects information on body movements of astronauts on the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) has led to motor imagery protocols used in the research environment \nof a hospital in Rome in treatment of adult stroke patients and children with cerebral palsy. Other body \nmovement research on the ISS led to the development of a suit for astronauts to compensate for the \nlack of daily loading from gravity. The clinical version of this suit is used for the comprehensive and \ndrug-free treatment of cerebral palsy in children in Russia. Another clinical variation of this suit is \nused on patients who have suffered from stroke or brain trauma.\nNew Technology Simulates Microgravity \nand Improves Balance on Earth\nSpaceflight opportunities, such as that of the ISS, \nfacilitated the development of Earth-based models \nof weightlessness and opened the door to studying \nthe effects of the elimination of gravity. Over the \n20 years since the ISS came into existence, the \nRussian Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) \nhas compiled a large amount of data—information \nand facts that have made it possible to switch from \ndescribing occurrences and phenomena to developing \ntheories about the role and place of gravitational \nmechanisms in various bodily systems.\nOne example of an evolution in the development \nof new knowledge is the discovery of the leading \ntriggering role in maintaining vertical posture of sensory \norgans called Vater-Paccini corpuscles, which are \nlocated in the soles of the feet. These receptors were \ndiscovered back in the 19th century; however, their \nrole in gravireception was established recently, thanks \nto ground-based simulation studies designed to \nkeep cosmonauts’ balance healthy in long-duration \nspaceflights. As a result of these studies, a unique \npiece of technology was developed to help to correct \nthe motor disturbances in individuals with central \nnervous system dysfunction, injuries, balance \nproblems and motor decline due to aging.\nGround-based studies at IBMP identified a particular \npattern of stabilization between body loading on the \nsoles of the feet and subsequent motor stabilization \nprocesses associated with brain and spinal cord \nactivities. The knowledge obtained revealed that \nthe development of sensory-motor disturbances may \nbe prevented by means of “artificial” support stimuli \napplied to the bottoms of the feet. The research \nresults led to the development of new technology, \nthe “support unloading compensator,” which is a \ndevice that stimulates the support zones of the foot \nin natural human gait.\nToday, this technology is being \nused in the most acute phase \nof stroke and facilitates more \nsignificant regression of motor \ndisturbances and earlier recovery \nof locomotion than traditional \ntreatment methods. \nThe uniqueness of this device lies in its ability to \nsimulate the physical parameters that the support \nreceptor or the foot receives during walking: the \nmagnitude of pressure, temporal characteristics, \nduration of impact, intervals between stimulation', '176\nobvious need to develop non-pharmacological methods \nof preventing and treating space motion sickness.\nThe suppression of negative \nreactions during flight using the \nfixation reflex has been successfully \napplied by crew members aboard \nthe ISS since 2013.\nIt is well known that people in extreme professions \nsuch as mountain climbers, athletes, acrobats and \nballet dancers develop the capability to suppress \nunfavorable vestibular reactions at the moment high \naccelerations act on them by developing a “fixation \nreflex.” However, attempts by many clinicians to treat \npatients with vestibular problems using the same \nmethods have been unsuccessful because of the \nvestibular challenges that are unique to this population. \nTherefore, experts at the vestibular physiology \nlaboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems \ndeveloped and patented a “Computerized method of \npreventing and correcting unfavorable perception and \nsensorimotor reactions” (Russian Federation patent \n#2301622 dated 06/27/2007, Kornilova L. N. et al.). \nThe innovation of this method is in creating a unique \napproach to the training of patients depending on their \ndisease (i.e., type of vestibulopathy) and in selecting \nthe most effective means of training (e.g., visual, \nvestibular, or combined) by using biofeedback.\nDepending on the nature of the vertigo, dizziness or \nequilibrium disorder and of his/her disease (type of \nvestibulopathy), a series of patient training sessions \nis conducted to develop a unique fixation reflex using \nbiofeedback that is provided by the computer using \nthis method to record eye and head movements.\nTraining is conducted until the negative reactions \n(i.e., vertgo, dizziness and equilibrium disturbances) \ndisappear or are significantly reduced. The therapeutic \neffect of the training is assessed through a follow-\nup clinical/neurological examination, which includes \nusing the computerized method of comprehensively \nassessing the condition of vestibular function and \nvisual tracking function (Russian Federation patent \n#2307575 dated 10/10/07, Kornilova L.

The indicator of training success is the \nsuppression of experimentally induced negative \nreactions (full or partial) during the action of visual \nand vestibular stimuli while fixing the gaze on an \nimagined target.\nThe non-pharmacological computerized method \nfor treating and preventing vertigo, dizziness and \nequilibrium disturbances was tested in clinical \nconditions jointly with specialists from the nervous \ndisease department of the I.

"Query: ""The term 'progressive research' is used in the document. How is it defined and what is its significance in the context of airship development?""","In the context of the document, ""progressive research"" is defined by Max M. Munk as a scientific approach that anticipates ""future discoveries and achievements"" and what ""someone will find"" rather than an engineering approach that focuses more on what is currently being found ""along trodden paths"" that stimulates industrial improvements ""by emphasizing what seems to be harmful, combining what harmonizes, and eliminating what is at variance."" The significance of this definition in the context of airship development is that Munk asserts that airship science is still young, virile, and has many problems of progressive research not touched, or hardly touched, which are highly pregnant of important airship improvements. This paper is exclusively devoted to that assertion, and to giving color to it by enumerating a list of such problems. The list is decidedly incomplete, for it is only what occurs right now to one man who has followed up the development. To other investigators naturally other and additional problems will occur. The purpose for which the paper enumerates some airship research problems is not to concentrate on any one particular problem but to give color to the assertion that airship science is still young, virile, and has many problems of progressive research not touched, or hardly touched, which are highly pregnant of important airship improvements.

In the context of the document, the author also mentions that the technical development of airships continues to lag behind that of airplanes due to the small numbers of airships built and the limited opportunity for development of new ideas and methods of construction. However, a design competition was held by the Navy Department for the procurement of the best designs for 6,000,000-cubic-foot airships, and negotiations toward a contract for the construction of one airship generally according to this design are underway. The design includes a number of features that are novel as far as actual incorporation in airships is concerned, but have been commonly discussed in that connection for many years.

The author also mentions that experimental investigation and research for the purpose of improving existing airships and providing improved materials and methods of construction for new airships whenever they are begun has continued, although at a decreased rate. The most notable results are the satisfactory methods for the protection of duralumin against corrosion and the obtaining of substitutes for goldbeater's skin fabric.

In terms of the Los Angeles","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n130\nDocument 5-8 (a), Max M. Munk, “On the Problems of Progressive Airship \nResearch,” in Report on Airship Forum, July 25–26, 1935 (Akron, OH: The \nDaniel Guggenheim Airship Institute, Publication No. 3, 1935), pp. 89–96.\nI am very grateful to the Daniel Guggenheim Airship Institute for this oppor\xad\ntunity to talk to you, and through you to the rest of the country, about the problems \nof progressive airship research, for it seems to me very necessary that something be \nsaid about it at this moment. By the term “progressive” research I mean that study\xad\ning, meditating, investigating, and experimenting in scientific spirit, the results \nof which are intended to inspire the engineer and designer to venture upon and \nenter into new paths of industrial progress. Advancing along trodden paths, mak\xad\ning industrial improvements by emphasizing what seems to be harmful, combin\xad\ning what harmonizes, eliminating what is at variance—that too requires careful \nstudying and experimenting, and a high expert training to do it well. Research \nalong that line is also very necessary and praiseworthy, no laudable attributes like \n“fundamental” and the like are too high and too dignified for describing and \ncharacterizing it. Only, gentlemen, that is not science, but merely requires sci\xad\nence, and I will not talk about that now as not being progressive research. There \nexists, indeed, no sharp demarcation line between the two kinds of research, and \nthe distinction has to be illustrated by extreme cases. Take this for instance. I am \ninformed that the Navy, or Army, I have forgotten which (probably both of them), \nrequires a wind-tunnel test with a model of every airplane type it purchases. It has \nnow happened that the airplane was delivered long ago and was found satisfac\xad\ntory and was performing well, and everything was fine except that the model test \nwas still missing. The model test was then made after the airplane was already in \ncommission. Very good. I personally see no reason why not, and the Navy and the \nArmy generally have good reasons why they do things they are doing; and in this \ncase the belated model test may still be of great value, in keeping up the statistics \nand for preparing for a reversal of the process, to make better conclusions from \ntests to airplanes. What I want to say is merely that that is not progressive research \nas I now intend to use the word.\nDiscussing progressive research in a general and broad way is not exactly what a \ntrue scientist is fond of doing, and I have always tried to be such a scientist. Neither \nthe polemical nor the speculative is the domain of science, but rather the positive \nand definite. Speaking of progressive airship research savors of anticipating future \ndiscoveries and achievements; not the “I found” but “someone will find” is the \nkeynote of it. A scientist dislikes to assume the part of a prophet, dislikes to predict \nin such intangible manner. Only strong and forceful reasons can induce him to \novercome his dislike and to take a larger view of his subject.\nSuch reasons are now, however, present. These are critical days for the future \nof American lighter[-]than[-]air development. With exceedingly bright prospects \non one hand, with dire and costly disappointments on the other, the country needs', '89\nDocument 5-2 (a–s)\nThe development of flight research methods and the consequent necessity for \nincreased accuracy of measurements have called for greater refinement in the record\xad\ning instruments used in flight research. Laboratory tests are being conducted almost \ncontinuously on the instruments to reduce errors caused by mechanical friction and \ntime lag in the parts, changes in the viscosity of the damping oil, lack of balance of \nmoving parts, etc. This work is particularly necessary for instruments used in accel\xad\nerated flight, and a considerable portion of this work has been concerned with the \nangular-velocity recorders and recording accelerometers. For investigations where \nmeasurements must be made in a very short period of time, such as when impact \nloads are measured, it has been necessary to greatly increase the film speed. A new \nelectric motor has been constructed for driving the film in order to obtain more \ndriving torque without increasing the size or weight of the motor, and this, together \nwith a new low-friction dynamically balanced film drum, has given speeds approxi\xad\nmately ten times those obtainable with the standard motor and drum. A control \nforce recorder suitable for recording stick forces in accelerated and level flight has \nbeen designed and constructed during the year and is now being\xa0tested.\nDocument 5-2 (m), “Airships,” NACA Annual Report (1931), pp. 65–66.\nAirship progress during the past year has been marked by one outstanding \nevent, namely, the completion and satisfactory trials of the U.S.S.

This \nairship of 6,500,000 cubic feet volume (helium) was contracted for by the Navy \nDepartment in October, 1928; erection of frames was started in November, 1929; \nand the airship was completed and ready for trials in September, 1931. Trial flights \namounting to approximately 100 hours were successfully carried out within a period \nof four weeks and the airship was thereupon accepted by the Navy Department and \ncommissioned as a United States naval airship.\nThe U.S.S. Akron represents a complete new design of airship conceived and \nbuilt entirely within the United States.

No \nnew airship construction has been begun in the United States. Attention has been \nconfined to the replacement of parts of existing nonrigid airships.\nA design competition was held by the Navy Department looking toward the \nprocurement of the best designs for the 6,000,000-cubic-foot airships which have \nbeen authorized by Congress as a part of the Navy Department “five-year aviation \nprogram.” A number of designs were submitted, among them a very satisfactory \none, and negotiations toward a contract for the construction of one airship gen\xad\nerally according to this design are under way. This design includes a number of \nfeatures which, while novel as far as actual incorporation in airships is concerned, \nhave been commonly discussed in that connection for many years.\nExperimental investigation and research for the purpose of improving existing \nairships and providing improved materials and methods of construction for new \nairships whenever they are begun has continued[,] although at a decreased rate. \nThe satisfactory methods for the protection of duralumin against corrosion and \nprogress made in the obtaining of substitutes for goldbeater’s skin fabric are the \nmost notable results.\nWork with the “Los Angeles.”—The Los Angeles has been maintained in splendid \ncondition and undoubtedly has several years of useful and active life before it.

The term 'progressive research' is defined in the document as the study, meditation, investigation, and experimentation in a scientific spirit, with the aim of inspiring engineers and designers to venture into new paths of industrial progress. It is distinguished from other types of research that require science but do not necessarily lead to new discoveries or achievements.

In the context of airship development, progressive research is significant because it is critical for the future of American lighter-than-air development. The country is facing both exceedingly bright prospects and dire and costly disappointments in this field, and progressive research can help navigate these challenges by inspiring innovation and progress."
"Question: ""How is the term 'progressive research' defined in the document and what is its significance in the context of airship development, according to the author?""","In the context of airship development, the author, Max M. Munk, defines ""progressive research"" as a scientific approach that anticipates future discoveries and achievements, rather than an engineering approach that merely requires science. According to Munk, airship science is still young, virile, and has many problems of progressive research not touched or hardly touched, which are highly pregnant of important airship improvements. The author's preference for what ""someone will find"" over what ""I found"" is essential to a proper understanding of Munk himself and adds fuel to the ongoing historiographical debate over appropriate distinctions between scientific and engineering approaches to technological knowledge and understanding. Munk argues that progressive research is comparatively cheap and that the main problem is to turn the work over to capable, honest, and really fitted men, and to provide a dignified and permanent haven for them, so that they may entirely concentrate on that sublime work. Munk believes that many American universities and similar institutes, as well as agencies of the Federal Government, can provide permanent and dignified positions for capable and constructive scientists, and that fundamental improvements of the lighter-than-air art during the next decade are a distinct potentiality, provided a demand for it is exhibited.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n130\nDocument 5-8 (a), Max M.

By the term “progressive” research I mean that study\xad\ning, meditating, investigating, and experimenting in scientific spirit, the results \nof which are intended to inspire the engineer and designer to venture upon and \nenter into new paths of industrial progress. Advancing along trodden paths, mak\xad\ning industrial improvements by emphasizing what seems to be harmful, combin\xad\ning what harmonizes, eliminating what is at variance—that too requires careful \nstudying and experimenting, and a high expert training to do it well. Research \nalong that line is also very necessary and praiseworthy, no laudable attributes like \n“fundamental” and the like are too high and too dignified for describing and \ncharacterizing it. Only, gentlemen, that is not science, but merely requires sci\xad\nence, and I will not talk about that now as not being progressive research. There \nexists, indeed, no sharp demarcation line between the two kinds of research, and \nthe distinction has to be illustrated by extreme cases. Take this for instance. I am \ninformed that the Navy, or Army, I have forgotten which (probably both of them), \nrequires a wind-tunnel test with a model of every airplane type it purchases. It has \nnow happened that the airplane was delivered long ago and was found satisfac\xad\ntory and was performing well, and everything was fine except that the model test \nwas still missing. The model test was then made after the airplane was already in \ncommission. Very good. I personally see no reason why not, and the Navy and the \nArmy generally have good reasons why they do things they are doing; and in this \ncase the belated model test may still be of great value, in keeping up the statistics \nand for preparing for a reversal of the process, to make better conclusions from \ntests to airplanes. What I want to say is merely that that is not progressive research \nas I now intend to use the word.\nDiscussing progressive research in a general and broad way is not exactly what a \ntrue scientist is fond of doing, and I have always tried to be such a scientist. Neither \nthe polemical nor the speculative is the domain of science, but rather the positive \nand definite. Speaking of progressive airship research savors of anticipating future \ndiscoveries and achievements; not the “I found” but “someone will find” is the \nkeynote of it. A scientist dislikes to assume the part of a prophet, dislikes to predict \nin such intangible manner. Only strong and forceful reasons can induce him to \novercome his dislike and to take a larger view of his subject.\nSuch reasons are now, however, present.

(See Document 5-11 for \nreflections about this matter.) Flight, after all, had achieved a prominent place in \nmodem society, not just as a transportation system but as a glorious symbol—per\xad\nhaps the symbol—of human progress. It was just a question of what form of flight \nwas going to fulfill that promise the best. By the start of World War II, it was clear \nthat that form would not be the airship.\nAs we will see in the first parcel of documents below, the development of air\xad\nships in the early 20th century contributed in many significant ways to the progress \nof aerodynamics generally, as did the airplane-airship competition itself. Airship \ndesign leaned more heavily on aerodynamic theory than did airplane design \nbecause a much lesser number and variety of airships had been built, so there was \nless empirical knowledge of airships. Larger and more expensive than airplanes, \ncompleted airship structures could not be modified for experimental variations as \nreadily; hence, flight testing was extremely limited. At the same time, wind tunnel \ntests of airships proved less persuasive than those of airplanes because of the rela\xad\ntively greater difficulties caused by scale effects.2\nOne thing that should be clear from some of the documents below is that atten\xad\ntion to airships, such as that paid by NACA researchers in the 1920s and 1930s, \nstimulated some productive crossflows between airship aerodynamics and airplane \naerodynamics. These exchanges took place in ordinary ways, such as when NACA \nengineers in the mid-1920s designed experimental nacelle shapes for airplane \nengines by starting with the best airship shape available. They also occurred in \nsome rather extraordinary ways, as readers may gather from Document 5-9, a chap\xad\nter on the aerodynamics of airships written by former NACA researcher Dr.\xa0Max \nM. Munk for William F. Durand’s 1936 six-volume Aerodynamic Theory. In this \nchapter, Munk predicts that “since airship design draws on the whole domain of \naerodynamics and since special airship aerodynamics should contain as its most \nnotable problem the full analysis of airship drag, it seems quite possible that from \nairship theory may some day come forward such fundamental progress as shall \nrevolutionize our technique of air travel.” In an important way, Munk’s intuition \nproved correct: airship theory became extremely valuable when aerodynamicists \nbegan to extend airfoil theory to the near-sonic and supersonic speed ranges. Most \nnotably, in 1945, NACA researcher Robert T. Jones, a student of Munk’s at Catholic \nUniversity in Washington, DC, in the early 1930s, used as the basis for a new \nslender-wing theory a linearization formulated by Munk in 1925 for approximating \nthe forces acting on airship hulls. Jones’s approximation avoided severe mathemati\xad\ncal difficulties in determining the lift distribution of wings—difficulties involving, \namong other things, the solution of an equation containing a double integral.

The term 'progressive research' is defined in the document as the study, meditation, investigation, and experimentation in a scientific spirit, with the aim of inspiring engineers and designers to venture into new paths of industrial progress. The author emphasizes that this type of research is necessary for the advancement of airship development, as it involves exploring new ideas and techniques rather than simply improving existing ones. The author also highlights the importance of this research in the current context, where the future of American lighter-than-air development is at a critical juncture, with both promising prospects and costly disappointments.

"""What is the difference between piston and turbofan engines in terms of their applications and characteristics?""","The text discusses the evolution of aircraft propulsion technology from piston engines to turbofan engines. Piston engines were dominant during the interwar and World War II periods, with Wright Aeronautical and Pratt & Whitney being pioneers in the field. However, the development of jet propulsion, particularly the turbojet engine, led to a shift in propulsion technology. The NACA's propulsion research transitioned from wartime development troubleshooting to long-term fundamental research, with clear lines of responsibility between the NACA and industry. The text also discusses the development of turboprop and turboshaft engines, as well as the introduction of accessories such as control apparatus, oil, fuel, and hydraulic pumps, lubricants, and fuels. The text highlights the differences between piston and turbofan engines in terms of their applications and characteristics. Piston engines were primarily used for smaller aircraft and had lower fuel consumption, while turbofan engines were more efficient at higher speeds and were used for larger commercial and military aircraft. The text also discusses the development of the counter-rotating turboprop engine, which was simpler, lighter, and more efficient at higher horsepower ranges. Overall, the text provides a historical overview of aircraft propulsion technology and its evolution over time.","['Foreword\nix\nairplane rise upward. Replacing the piston engine with a gas turbine to drive a \npropeller resulted in the turbine propeller, or “turboprop,” engine. The propel\xad\nler and its power source are the most efficient at moving a large mass of air for \nthrust at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour.\nThe second type of propulsion system, the jet engine, which is another type \nof gas turbine, emerged during World War II and serves as the dominant pro\xad\npulsion system for high-performance military and commercial aviation since \nit is most efficient at speeds of over 500 miles per hour. A jet engine takes in \nair, compresses it, mixes it with vaporized fuel, ignites it, and pushes it out to \ncreate thrust. The main parts of a jet engine that accomplish that process are \nthe inlet, compressor, burner, turbine, and exhaust nozzle.\nThere are different types of gas turbine engines to suit the specific needs of \nthe various types of aircraft. The oldest configuration is the turbojet, which is a \npure jet that produces a lot of thrust at the expense of high fuel consumption. \nThe addition of a large, enclosed, multiblade fan to a turbojet harnessed higher \nefficiencies while developing the high thrust of the turbojet. The fan created \na secondary airstream that bypassed the rest of the engine and contributed to \nthe overall production of thrust. The bypass ratio—the correlation between \nthe mass flows of air traveling in those two pathways—is a gauge of propulsive \nefficiency. The widespread introduction of turbofans in the 1960s represented \na dramatic jump in efficiency for jet-powered aircraft. Supersonic fighter air\xad\ncraft feature afterburners for short bursts of extra speed. The injection of fuel \ninto the hot exhaust stream produces additional thrust at the cost of high \nfuel consumption for increased engine power at takeoff, climb, and cruise. In \nturboprop and turboshaft engines, the turbine section takes energy from the \nexhaust gas stream to turn a propeller or rotor in addition to the compressor.\nPropulsion technology is more than just piston engines; propellers; gas \nturbines; and individual components such as compressors, turbine blades, \nand disks. Support technologies, called accessories, include control apparatus; \noil; fuel; and hydraulic pumps, lubricants, and fuels. Moreover, as you will see \nin this book, there are interrelated technical goals rooted in efficiency, noise, \nand emissions. Issues related to airframe integration, primarily engine nacelle \nplacement and inlet and exhaust design, also can affect propulsion systems.\nThis is a survey of NASA’s work in aircraft propulsion from its origins as \nthe National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to the early 21st \ncentury. It stands as a point of departure rooted in an extensive body of work \nthat addresses the topic, and it is supported by primary source material. It \nintroduces NASA’s role in the technology while taking into account economic, \npolitical, and cultural dimensions.

On the \nquestion of jet propulsion, Mead, the head of the influential Power Plants \nCommittee, remarked in December 1942, “I doubt whether such a revo\xad\nlutionary change in propulsion could be developed in time to be of use in \nthis\xa0war….”82\nCatching Up with Europe\nBy the time the United States entered World War II, it was already behind in \nthe “race” with Great Britain and Germany to develop a workable jet aircraft. \nThe American aeronautical engine industry underwent a transition to meet \nthe challenge of engineering the new technology. In the process, one estab\xad\nlished company, Wright Aeronautical, left the business, while another, Pratt \n& Whitney, persevered, and a new one, GE, rose to the challenge. By 1960, \nAmerica was a leading member of a new aeronautical gas turbine industry, \nthanks, in large measure, to the NACA’s work.\nThe NACA was completely unaware of the impending “turbojet” revolu\xad\ntion. Its researchers believed that the continued evolution of the piston engine \nwas the future direction of propulsion technology. The design and operation \nof the AERL reflected that practical purpose.83 The American aeronautical \ncommunity concentrated on present and immediate needs that reflected the \ndominance of the piston engine and propeller as the primary propulsion system \nduring the interwar period. When faced with fighting a global aerial war, the \nAmerican military embraced that standard and wedded it to large-scale pro\xad\nduction programs to avoid the strategic mistake of putting too much emphasis \non new technologies that would only be practical in the long term and after \ncostly research and development, not immediately and on aerial battlefields \naround the world.84\nThe two major American manufacturers of aeronautical engines were \nWright Aeronautical and Pratt & Whitney. Both were pioneers in the field \nand were responsible for the dominance of the piston engine during the \ninterwar and World War II periods. Wright’s innovative designs included the \n610-horsepower V-1400 racing engine that powered famed aviator Jimmy \nDoolittle’s Schneider Trophy–winning Curtiss R3C-2 Racer in 1925; the \n225-horsepower J-5 Whirlwind that powered Lindbergh’s Spirit of St. Louis \nin 1927; and the four 2,200-horsepower R-3350 turbosupercharged radials \nof the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which spearheaded the American strategic \nbombing campaign against Japan in 1944–1945, serving as the world’s first', 'The NACA and Aircraft Propulsion, 1915–1958\n31Right side view of General Electric I-A Turbojet mounted on a wheeled engine stand, with two unidentified General Electric employees posed standing behind on either side of the engine; circa 1943-1945.\nFigure 1-11.

Would it continue with propeller-driven piston engine \naircraft or go with the new jet technology? In 1945, the piston engine was \nthe main power plant for aviation. Within 3 years, there were multiple alter\xad\nnatives.104 The NACA’s propulsion research in Cleveland transitioned from \nwartime development troubleshooting to long-term fundamental research. In \nDecember 1945, a laboratory plan divided agency research into nine categories \nwith varying emphasis: turbojets (20 percent); turboprops (20 percent); contin\xad\nuous ramjets (12.5 percent); intermittent ramjets (5.5 percent); rocket engines \n(4 percent); reciprocating engines (13 percent); compound engines (reciprocat\xad\ning engine and turbosupercharger) (15 percent); icing research (5\xa0percent); and \n“engines for supersonic flight” (5 percent). The priorities reflected the overall \nshift toward fundamental research, with clear lines of responsibility between \nthe NACA and industry, which reflected overall the National Aeronautical \nResearch Policy approved in March 1946.105', 'The Quest for Propulsive Efficiency, 1976–1989\n121\nStandard developed with Lewis engineers a flow visualization method based on \na three-dimensional Euler solution and a high-resolution grid.

Company engineers ventured from conven\xad\ntional turboprop design by choosing not to use a complicated gearbox. In \nprevious designs, a system of gears ensured that the propeller and the gas tur\xad\nbine turned at their individually ideal rpms. GE elected to remove the entire \nchallenge of designing a gearbox capable of 20,000 shaft horsepower and, \ninstead, to drive the two rows of blades with turbine stages powered by the \ncore section from an F404 military turbofan. In other words, the power from \nthe exhaust of the core engine was transmitted to the blades directly, without \na gearbox; although unorthodox, this approach was simpler, lighter, and more \nefficient at higher horsepower ranges.58 Performance estimates indicated a 32:1 \nbypass ratio, a 4:1 thrust-to-weight ratio, and a specific fuel consumption of \n0.52 at Mach 0.8 and 35,000 feet. Estimates put fuel consumption at 30\xa0per\xad\ncent less than that of most contemporary turbofan engines and 50 percent \nlower than that of engines used on 150-passenger airliners.

The work focused on the initial design and ground tests, which \nalleviated GE’s startup risks and accelerated the overall development time for \nthe UDF. The shared objectives centered on the successful demonstration of \nthe gearless propfan concept as a viable alternative to turbofan engines. The \npartnership consisted of scale-model, full-scale fan blade, and static engine \ntests, as well as the design of the nacelle and specific engine components.60\nEager to pursue the new idea, GE engineers designed and fabricated three \ncounter-rotating model rigs for the aerodynamic, acoustic, and aeroelastic test\xad\ning of various blade designs, speeds, and blade row spacing.

Piston engines are primarily used in general aviation and smaller aircraft, while turbofan engines are used in larger commercial and military aircraft. Piston engines operate by using reciprocating motion to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, while turbofan engines use a gas turbine to compress and expand air to produce thrust.

Piston engines have a lower specific fuel consumption (SFC) compared to turbofan engines, but they produce less thrust and are less efficient at high altitudes and speeds. Piston engines also have a lower power-to-weight ratio compared to turbofan engines.

Turbofan engines, on the other hand, have a higher SFC compared to piston engines, but they produce more thrust and are more efficient at high altitudes and speeds. Turbofan engines also have a higher power-to-weight ratio compared to piston engines. Additionally, turbofan engines are quieter than piston engines due to the use of a fan to produce additional thrust, which reduces the noise generated by the engine.

In terms of applications, piston engines are commonly used in general aviation, training aircraft, and smaller aircraft, while turbofan engines are used in larger commercial and military aircraft. Turbofan engines are also used in business jets and regional jets.

In summary, piston engines are typically used in smaller aircraft and have a lower SFC and power-to-weight ratio compared to turbofan engines. Turbofan engines are typically used in larger aircraft and have a higher SFC and power-to-weight ratio compared to piston engines, but they produce more thrust and are more efficient at high altitudes and speeds. Turbofan engines are also quieter than piston engines."
How does the planetary decadal survey process differ from the NAC process?,"The planetary decadal survey process, which is conducted by the Space Studies Board (SSB) under the auspices of the National Research Council (NRC) for NASA, differs from the NAC process in several ways. The NAC is an organization internal to NASA, while the SSB is external to NASA and conducts studies for the Agency on a contractual basis. The NAC is independent from the NASA program offices, but its recommendations can be implemented or not by the NASA Administrator, while the SSB's recommendations are more detailed and programmatic, and nearly all SSB reports are available to the public. The SSB's decadal surveys for planetary science represent a shift in programmatic decision-making for NASA, as they include more detailed programmatic recommendations than most previous SSB works.

In the 1990s NASA \nofficials began to use the “Flagship” rubric to characterize those costing more \nthan $1 billion, sometimes significantly more than $1 billion.

The NAC is an organization that is internal to NASA, meaning it is part of the agency. The NASA Administrator has the authority to implement NAC recommendations, or not. The NAC does not publish many formal studies, and the recommendations may or may not be made public.

On the other hand, the SSB is external to NASA and conducts studies for the agency on a contractual basis. Nearly all SSB reports are available to the public, and the board regularly briefs Congress on findings. This means that the SSB's recommendations are more likely to be made public and accessible to the general public.

In terms of the planetary decadal survey process, the SSB has been conducting decadal surveys for planetary science since the early 2000s, providing recommendations from the science community on programs within NASA and prioritizing the most important questions in planetary science. The SSB's decadal surveys have shifted the focus of programmatic decision-making for NASA, as they include more detailed programmatic recommendations than most previous SSB works.

Congress has often instructed NASA to fund studies on various topics and now regularly includes language in legislation directing NASA to execute the recommendations of SSB decadal surveys. Excerpts from decadal surveys have appeared in congressional authorization legislation, indicating the high regard in which members of Congress now hold these reports.

Therefore, the SSB's planetary decadal survey process is more transparent and publicly available than the NAC's process, and it has a more significant impact on NASA's programmatic decision-making."
What was the objective of Luna 13 and what were the results of its mission?,"Luna 13 was a Soviet spacecraft launched on December 21, 1966, with the objective of a lunar soft-landing. After a routine course correction on December 22, 1966, Luna 13 began its approach to the Moon. The retro-rocket engine fired at 17:59 UT on December 24, 1966, about 70 kilometers above the surface. Within two minutes, by 18:01 UT, Luna 13 was safely on the lunar surface, having landed in the Ocean of Storms between the Krafft and Seleneus craters at 18° 52′ N / 62° 04′ W, some 440 kilometers from Luna 9. The first signal from the probe was received at 18:05:30 UT. Unlike its predecessor, the heavier Luna 13 lander (113 kilograms) carried a suite of scientific instruments in addition to the usual imaging system. A three-axis accelerometer within the pressurized frame of the lander recorded the landing forces during impact to determine the regolith structure down to a depth of 20–30 centimeters. A pair of spring-loaded booms (not carried on Luna 9) capable of extending 1.5 meters beyond the lander, was also deployed. One of these was equipped with the RP radiation densitometer for determining the composition of the lunar surface, and the other with the GR-1 penetrometer to investigate the mechanical strength of the soil. At 18:06 UT, a small solid-propellant motor fired and forced the GR-1 instrument, a 3.5-centimeter diameter titanium-tipped rod, into the lunar surface. The instrument recorded how fast and how far into the soil (4.5 centimeters) the probe penetrated, thus helping scientists gain valuable information for future landers.

The Luna 13 mission was part of the Soviet Union's Luna program, which aimed to study the Moon and its environment. The program was initiated in 1958 and continued until 1976, with a total of 24 spacecraft launched.","['64\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016\nchange its orbital plane in order to provide tracking \ndata of the Moon’s gravitational field over a wider \nswath.

Initial orbital parameters \nwere 100 × 100 kilometers at 65° inclination. \nThree days later at 19:13 UT, the spacecraft fired \nits main engine for 267 seconds to begin descent \nto the lunar surface. A second firing at an altitude \nof 760 meters further reduced velocity before Luna \n20 set down safely on the Moon at 19:19:09 UT \non 21 February 1972 at coordinates 3° 32′ N / 56° \n33′ E (as announced at the time), only 1.8 kilo\xad\nmeters from the crash site of Luna 18, in a high\xad\nland region between Mare Fecunditatis and Mare \nCrisium. The spacecraft settled on a slope of about \n8° to 10°. After landing, the imaging system was \nused to locate a scientifically promising location to \ncollect a sample, which was done on 23 February, \nbut in stages due to increased soil resistance. After \nthe sample was safely collected, the spacecraft’s \nascent stage lifted off at 22:58 UT on 22 February \nand quickly accelerated to 2.7 kilometers/second \nvelocity, sufficient to return to Earth. The small \nspherical capsule parachuted down safely on an \nisland in the Karkingir river, 40 kilometers north\xad\nwest of the town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at \n19:12 UT on 25\xa0February 1972.

The objective of Luna 13 was a lunar soft-landing. It was launched by the USSR on 21 December 1966. Luna 13 successfully soft-landed on the surface of the Moon in the Ocean of Storms between the Krafft and Seleucus craters at 18° 52′ N / 62° 04′ W, some 440 kilometers from Luna 9. The first signal from the probe was received at 18:05:30 UT. The lander carried a suite of scientific instruments in addition to the usual imaging system. A three-axis accelerometer within the pressurized frame of the lander recorded the landing forces during impact to determine the regolith structure down to a depth of 20-30 centimeters. A pair of spring-loaded booms capable of extending 1.5 meters beyond the lander were also deployed. One of these was equipped with the RP radiation densitometer for determining the composition of the lunar surface, and the other with the GR-1 penetrometer to investigate the mechanical strength of the soil. The GR-1 instrument, a 3.5-centimeter diameter titanium-tipped rod, was forced into the lunar surface and recorded how fast and how far into the soil (4.5 centimeters) the probe penetrated. The RP densitometer emitted gamma quanta from a cesium-137 sample into the soil and recorded the scattering to provide an estimate of the density of the soil, found to be about 0.8 g/cm3. Four radiometers recorded infrared radiation from the surface indicating a noon temperature of 117±3°C while a radiation detector indicated that radiation levels would be less than hazardous for humans. The lander returned a total of five panoramas of the lunar surface, showing a terrain smoother than that seen by Luna 9. The mission concluded successfully with a last communications session between 04:05 UT and 06:13 UT on 28 December when the onboard batteries were exhausted."
"What are some of the key factors that contribute to the success of a space mission, as highlighted by the experiences of the Genesis, CONTOUR, and MESSENGER projects?","1. Strong leadership and management: The Genesis project manager was described as a ""visionary"" who was able to keep the team focused on the mission's goals and objectives. The CONTOUR project manager emphasized the importance of making decisions in short time frames and not letting optimism about the mission distract from potential issues. The MESSENGER project manager acknowledged the trust placed in the contractor to deliver on its promises and the need for close-knit teams to ensure critical crosstalk between engineers, scientists, and managers.

2. Collaboration and teamwork: The experiences of the Genesis, CONTOUR, and MESSENGER projects highlighted the importance of teamwork at all levels, including making sure that everyone down to the most peripheral contributor knows that their contribution is part of the success. Close-knit teams ensure critical crosstalk between the engineers, the scientists, and the managers. Scientists are often found talking to engineers on campus, and vice versa. This collaboration is both spurred on by and contributes to an overall excitement about the pending data return.

3. Decisiveness, fairness, and resistance to scope creep: The CONTOUR project manager named decisiveness, fairness, and taking a stand against scope creep (the temptation to add capabilities after design) as top qualities for a PI. It is very difficult for a scientist leading a team of scientists to resist recommending or approving small engineering tweaks that promise great increases in the science return. The temptation to improve the mission during development is present in every mission, often accompanied by pressure from the science team also invested in mission success. A good PI keeps careful watch on his or her payload, resisting changes in instruments that deviate significantly from the requirements in either direction, as small changes in scope can have disastrous effects on mission budgets.

4. Open communication: The experiences of the Genesis, CONTOUR, and MESSENGER projects highlighted the importance of open communication between scientists, engineers, and managers. The PI on CONTOUR brought forth proposed changes, and the project manager detailed the impact that each would have on the spacecraft, and together they struck a balance between the needs of the science team and the engineering team. This open communication enhanced their teamwork, and the project manager was not threatened by the PI also directing instrument developers at her institution.

5. Respect for science and scientists","['NASA′s Discovery Program\n352\nMESSENGER, Dawn, and Kepler. Of the seven planetary missions (Mars Reconnaissance \nOrbiter, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and New Horizons were also studied; Kepler \nwas classified as an Astrophysics mission), six experienced 28 percent or more growth \nin cost. Two had 85 percent or more growth in power, two had about 27 percent growth \nin power, and two had less than 10 percent growth in power (one showed no data). As \nfor cost growth, three planetary missions showed just less than 40 percent cost growth, \none had about 25 percent cost growth, two had a little more than 15 percent cost \ngrowth, and one was less than 10 percent. This growth, while unfortunate, was dwarfed \nby the growth in Earth-orbiting missions (five Astrophysics, five Earth Science, and \nthree Heliophysics, considered as a group) in development during the same decade. \nFour Earth-orbiting missions doubled their Phase B cost, and five more missions had \nmore than 60 percent cost growth. Only two of the 13 experienced 25\xa0percent or less \ngrowth in cost.118\nThe weakness of many CADRe cost studies of the time was the absence of reasons \nfor cost growth. Sometimes numbers can be misleading—and nowhere was this more \nthe case than in the early days of Dawn and Kepler, when institutional and management \nchanges caused the costs committed at the start of Phase B to be almost meaningless in \nthe face of changes in institutional burden and the layering of an additional management \ninstitution at no fault of the project. These factors, and factors such as additional costs \nincurred to comply with the NASA Integrated Action Team recommendations for the \nearlier missions such as Genesis, Deep Impact, and MESSENGER, were essential to \nunderstand and track before making sweeping statements. This study notwithstanding, \nit was not at all clear that missions like Dawn were underscoped; instead, there were \nnot sufficient reserves or commitment to proposed costs on the part of the managing \ninstitutions involved. Numbers alone do not tell the whole story.\nComparisons were also made between the individual missions and types of mis\xad\nsions in schedule growth. Taken as a whole, the set of 20 missions showed 38 percent \nschedule growth. Seven Earth-orbiting missions had growth at about the 50 percent \nlevel or greater. Another four Earth-orbiting and two planetary missions had greater \nthan 30 percent schedule growth. Only two planetary missions had 10 percent or less \nschedule growth, with the remaining three between 15 and 30 percent. But the study \nmay not account for program-directed changes, such as the effects of the late start \nfor both Dawn and Kepler after the 2000 selection, when the money to start Phase\xa0B \nwas not available as predicted. Indeed, while schedule growth was a real problem \nfor Astrophysics, Earth Science, and Heliophysics missions, it tended to be less of \nan issue for planetary and Discovery missions with fixed launch windows. Schedule \ngrowth of planetary missions was typically constrained by launch windows, but when \n118 \t\nFreaner, C., et al.

Another remnant of the earlier era, when Discovery was a grand experi\xad\nment in possibilities, was the removal of requirements that critical areas of spacecraft \ndesign be built with multiple safeguards. It was not uncommon for mechanisms to be \n“single string,” without a built-in backup in case part of the mechanism failed. Genesis \nwould have benefited from a second redundant technique—not just redundancy in \nparts—for sensing deceleration upon Earth return, for example. Safeguards like that, \nnot deemed essential in the earlier era, were reintroduced over time.\nThrough formulation, design, development, and testing, the CONTOUR project \nmanager echoed the Genesis experience; she added that one of the key things she liked \nabout Discovery is that managers are forced to make decisions in short time frames \nand not let matters remain unresolved. The constraints force project managers to be \neven more proactive in addressing potential issues, as there is little time built in to \ncorrect problems that have gone on too long. Experienced project managers know \nto keep vigilant for potential issues, not letting optimism about the mission distract \nthem, and for that reason, experience is important. Even small issues can have large \nconsequences if not rapidly resolved. CONTOUR’s early financial difficulties also high\xad\nlighted the importance of selecting savvy project managers with experience in costing \nand replanning space missions.\nThe second MESSENGER project manager reiterated the point about carefully \nscheduling or agreeing to delivery dates. The initial bid must be planned carefully, \nand the project manager should be involved at proposal so that he or she can not only \nenforce the words in the proposal, but also carry through with the intent, with full \nknowledge of the assumptions and context. Both project managers emphasized the \nimportance of teamwork at all levels, including making sure that everyone down to \nthe most peripheral contributor knows that their contribution is part of the success. \nAs the second project manager put it, “I know the guy that loads the spacecraft on \nthe truck and takes it down to the Cape.”15 Close-knit teams ensure critical crosstalk \nbetween the engineers, the scientists, and the managers. Scientists are often found \ntalking to engineers on campus, and vice versa. This collaboration is both spurred on \nby and contributes to an overall excitement about the pending data return.\nThe Dawn mission, managed on the opposite coast and in a different engineering \nculture, ran into trouble in part because faraway contractors did not make satisfac\xad\ntory progress on technical deliveries, and the team did not realize the full extent of \nthe problem in time. The second project manager faulted his trust in the contractor to \ndeliver on its promises; the third project manager then acknowledged that trust was \n15 \t\nNiebur, S. (2009, 27 July).

Where this failed, however, the results were significant: both \nDeep Impact and MESSENGER, for example, experienced crises in project management \nand large overruns in 2002–2003, nearly ten years after the Discovery Program began.\nDuring this time, Deep Impact, largely built by an engineering team in Colorado \nwith a West Coast project manager and an East Coast PI, suffered from insufficient \noversight of subcontractors. This problem deteriorated to the crisis point, requiring \nreplacement of the project manager and a change in management style. The PI began \nspending increased amounts of time onsite with the prime contractor, getting to know \nits engineering culture and inviting informal questions in the hallway. Once the PI \ntook these steps and the new project manager spent more time onsite managing the \nprime contractor and checking on the progress of subcontractors, the project turned \naround and delivered a successful spacecraft and spectacular science.\nIn the case of MESSENGER, technical challenges such as late deliveries coincided \nwith an unexpected change in project management as the original project manager \nretired and his deputy disappeared, not returning to work after a particularly chal\xad\nlenging trip to an underperforming subcontractor. The implementing organization \nwas left scrambling, and the new project manager began a fresh costing effort that \ndetermined that the mission was in far greater trouble than imagined. This manager \nworked closely with the PI and NASA management to bring the mission back on \ntrack, and, after several infusions of additional funding, it went on to become one of \nNASA’s greatest successes.\nAs PIs delegated more and more responsibility to project managers, increasingly \nthe roles returned to those of the pre-Discovery era, where the project manager was \n5 \t\nBinder, A.

The Kepler PI spent decades working to make his mission \na success. These PIs worked day and night for many years to ensure mission success.\nInsights from the Project Managers\nThese efforts did not go unrecognized by the project managers. In their formal oral \nhistory interviews, the project managers were also asked to identify the characteristics \nor skills that are important for a good PI. While a few reiterated points they had made \nearlier while discussing mission challenges, others credited the level of involvement of \nthe PI who they had worked with, and how it contributed to mission\xa0development.11\nThe CONTOUR project manager for design and development named decisiveness, \nfairness, and taking a stand against scope creep (the temptation to add capabilities \nafter design) as top qualities for a PI. It is very difficult for a scientist leading a team of \nscientists to resist recommending or approving small engineering tweaks that promise \ngreat increases in the science return. The temptation to improve the mission during \ndevelopment is present in every mission, often accompanied by pressure from the \nscience team also invested in mission success. A good PI keeps careful watch on his \nor her payload, resisting changes in instruments that deviate significantly from the \nrequirements in either direction, as small changes in scope can have disastrous effects \non mission budgets. The CONTOUR PI also was described as a good listener, allowing \nnew ideas from all sorts of sources, taking them into account while remaining focused \non the carefully plotted next steps to mission success.\nStardust’s PI was focused on the science return of the mission and delegated the \nday-to-day work of management to the project manager. He understood the engineering \nenough, as the first project manager put it, that he felt it best to delegate its manage\xad\nment and trust that he would be consulted on tough issues. Both project managers \nappreciated that, cajoling him occasionally to join them at certain meetings or travel to \nthe implementing organization to review progress. The second project manager spoke \njust as highly of him as the first, calling him a gem who gave the project manager all \nthe freedom he needed to get the job done. By delegating the contract management, \ncost and technical oversight, and mission planning to the project manager and his \nimplementing organization, the PI was free to keep working on his own science, to \nserve on community panels, to give public talks, and to do interviews in support of \nthe mission. He sparked interest in the mission by being present in another way—not \nat the engineering level, but at the level of public engagement.\n11 \t\nNiebur, S. (2011, 19 March).

That power \nwas rarely used, but everyone appreciated the possibility that they might not agree \nand briefed each other thoroughly.\nAs the PI on CONTOUR brought forth proposed changes, the project manager \ndetailed the impact that each would have on the spacecraft, and together they struck \ncompromises that improved the science without increasing scope. Both kept tight \nrein on scope and how it affected the program budget. Their weekly conversations \nwere wide-ranging and supplemented by phone calls as needed, both with the project \nmanager and with instrument developers. This open communication enhanced their \nteamwork, and the project manager was not threatened by the PI also directing instru\xad\nment developers at her institution.\nTight collaboration between scientists, engineers, and managers such as that exhib\xad\nited on MESSENGER fed forward into excitement about engineering challenges met \nand anticipated data return, on all sides, making conflicts more negotiable. When \nscientists and engineers are used to working together in a culture and a problem \narises, they have a common language and mutual respect that make issue resolution \nmore straightforward and more effective. No one throws issues to the other side of \nthe fence because everyone is already sitting at the table. Everyone’s contributions are \nwell defined and valued, all in support of the successful launch and data return. This \ncollaborative atmosphere increases the willingness of team members to take direction \nand implement decisions, since they have a greater understanding of the efforts of \npeople on other sides of the interface.\nThe second Dawn project manager came to the project after much of the formula\xad\ntion work had been done, but he fit into the mission smoothly due to his two decades \nof experience working with scientists and engineers at a federally funded research and \ndevelopment center. As a deputy director for the Engineering and Science Directorate \nbefore joining Dawn, he spoke the language of both sides, appreciating science as well \nas the engineering that it took to obtain groundbreaking science results. It was this \nrespect for science and scientists that gained the respect of the PI, and they worked \ntogether to heal the rifts left in the team after the systems requirements definition \nfailures highlighted at the program mission and systems review. The two were able, \nquickly, to address the mass, power, and budget problems, facing them as a team rather \nthan leaders of opposing sides. Working together, they harnessed their resources to \nproceed in a unified direction and keep the mission from being canceled.\nThe next Dawn project manager, who appeared at another critical juncture, agreed \nthat the working relationship between the project manager and PI was essential. The \nPI needs to know when not to interfere in the engineering, and the project manager \nneeds to honor the science requirements.

1. Short decision-making time frames: This forces project managers to be proactive in addressing potential issues and not let matters remain unresolved.
2. Experience: Experienced project managers are crucial as they can keep vigilant for potential issues and have the knowledge to address them promptly.
3. Careful planning and scheduling of delivery dates: The initial bid must be planned carefully, and the project manager should be involved at the proposal stage to enforce the words in the proposal and carry through with the intent, considering the assumptions and context.
4. Teamwork and communication: Close-knit teams ensure critical crosstalk between the engineers, the scientists, and the managers. Collaboration between different levels and roles is essential for the success of the mission.
5. Redundancy and safeguards: Mechanisms should not be ""single string"" without built-in backup in case part of the mechanism fails. Additional safeguards can help prevent issues, especially during critical phases like Earth return.
6. Trust and verification: Trust in contractors should be balanced with verification of their progress on technical deliveries to avoid unexpected issues.
7. Costing and replanning: Selecting project managers with experience in costing and replanning space missions is important, especially when facing financial difficulties.
8. Excitement and anticipation: A shared sense of excitement and anticipation about the pending data return can contribute to the overall success of the mission."
"Question: What was the significance of Gordon Fullerton's landing of the NASA F-15 using only engine power to turn, climb, and descend on April 21, 1993?","The significance of Gordon Fullerton's landing of the NASA F-15 using only engine power to turn, climb, and descend on April 21, 1993, was that it proved the capability of the PCA system, which was a computer-assisted engine control system that lets a plane land safely with only engine power if its normal control surfaces such as elevators, rudders or ailerons are disabled. The flight control system helped the pilot control the engines to turn the aircraft, climb, descend and eventually land safely by varying the speed of the engines one at a time or together.

Fullerton descended in the F-15 in a shallow approach to approximately \n20 feet above the runway. The rate of descent increased dramatically, but the \nveteran test pilot brought the aircraft down safely and effectively proved the \ncapability of the PCA system. Burcham remarked that while the technology \nwas proven for incorporation into future aircraft designs, he hoped “it never \nhas to be used.”35 A series of guest pilots from industry and the military went \non to fly the F-15 in a series of trial approaches and go-arounds, and their \nenthusiasm for PCA was unanimous.36NASA's HIDEC (Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control) F-15 aircraft nears the runway after a flight out of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California. The last project it was used for at Dryden was development of a computer-assisted engine control system that lets a plane land safely with only engine power if its normal control surfaces such as elevators, rudders or ailerons are disabled.

Bob Whitehead, Director \nof Subsonic Transportation in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology \n(OAST), who convened the meeting, believed that industry had to support \nthe project for it to receive the appropriate funding and move forward. He \nintroduced the topic and set in motion a roundtable discussion of the program. \nAt the end of the meeting, everyone was in agreement that the PCA project \nshould move forward. They created a full-fledged Government-industry col\xad\nlaborative project with $2.5 million in funding.37\nMcDonnell Douglas became the primary contractor. The company built the \nlatest-generation airliners, which were a perfect example of the type of aircraft \nthat needed PCA. The MD-11 was a three-engine wide-body airliner derived \nfrom the earlier DC-10, but with the latest computerized full flight control \nsystem and digital engine controls. The company started with simulations, to \nwhich the initial reactions were very good.38This McDonnell Douglas MD-11 transport aircraft approaches its first landing under engine power only on Aug. 29, 1995, at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California.\nThe milestone flight, flown by NASA research pilot and former astronaut Gordon Fullerton, was part of a NASA project to develop a computer-assisted engine control system that enables a pilot to land a plane safely when its normal control surfaces are disabled. The Propulsion-Controlled Aircraft (PCA) system uses standard autopilot controls already present in the cockpit, together with the new programming in the aircraft's flight control computers.\n\nThe PCA concept is simple--for pitch control, the program increases thrust to climb and reduces thrust to descend. To turn right, the autopilot increases the left engine thrust while decreasing the right engine thrust. The initial Propulsion-Controlled Aircraft studies by NASA were carried out at Dryden with a modified twin-engine F-15 research aircraft.\nFigure 5-7. In August 1995, Gordon Fullerton brings the MD-11 in for the first PCA landing of \nan airliner. (NASA)\nWith the help of Drew Pappas, McDonnell Douglas project manager, the \nproject received an MD-11 for flight testing. The first PCA flight over the \nmanufacturer’s Yuma, AZ, facility occurred on August 27, 1995. The pilots \nclimbed to 10,000 feet and turned on the PCA system. It held the wings level \nand on the desired flightpath with minor deviations in direction and altitude. \nTwo days later, Gordon Fullerton flew the MD-11 during its first landing"", 'The Power for Flight\n148A simple sketch on a TWA napkin by NASA Dryden engineer Frank W.

Bill Burcham’s sketch of the PCA concept. (NASA)\nBurcham’s goal was to create a backup landing system—based solely on the \nthrust of an aircraft’s engines—for aircraft that had lost their flight controls. \nThe key was using technology already found in the latest aircraft: digital flight \nand engine control computers. The question was whether that equipment \ncould be utilized for that purpose. PCA amounted to a reconfiguration pro\xad\ngram where Burcham and Stewart’s team replaced traditional means of control \nwith a new system based on engine thrust.28\nThe first step in the program was to ascertain if a pilot could alter the \ncourse of an airplane through the use of engine throttles, or Throttles Only \nControl (TOC). By manipulating the throttles, a pilot could maneuver the \nairplane with two forms of thrust. Collective thrust controlled flightpath, or \nlateral control, while differential thrust controlled bank angle.29 Starting in the \nsimulator, Burcham had the F-15’s controls locked in place. A pilot himself, \nhe maneuvered the aircraft using only the engine throttles. He advanced one \nthrottle and retarded the other to roll the aircraft. Pushing both throttles for\xad\nward pitched the nose up. Pushing them back dipped the nose down. After a \nfew crashes, Burcham was able to safely land the F-15 in the simulator.30', 'Propulsion Control Enters the Computer Era, 1976–1998\n149\nThe software model of an aircraft and its flying environment found in a \nsimulation offered flight experience without the risks of actually being in the \nair. Besides the airplane’s various systems, including the propulsion system, the \nsimulator included an airport and weather, which all amounted to “an elaborate \nvideo game” for the research team. “Flying” the Dryden Boeing 720 simulator \nrevealed that a PCA aircraft suffered from a lethargic response of the engines \nto control inputs during TOC.31\nPCA firmly straddled both worlds of flight control and propulsion research. \nIn response, both communities were lukewarm to the idea initially, and it \nplayed to very mixed reviews. One initially skeptical engineer remembered, \n“PCA wasn’t intuitively obvious,” while another labeled it as “hare-brained!” \nNASA Headquarters feared premature regulatory action by Federal agencies \ncentered on safety that would curtail manufacturer interest and develop\xad\nment before the idea could be fully explored. They advised Dryden Director \nKen\xa0Szalai to discontinue work on PCA.32\nNevertheless, the work continued, and it fortified the reasons for the pro\xad\ngram. The addition of well-known research pilot and former Space Shuttle \nastronaut C. Gordon Fullerton to the team instantly added credibility. He \nexperienced the same problems with the lethargic response of the controls. If \npilots continued to use the control stick, they would expect the same quick \nresponse as from traditional flight controls, which could lead to fatal errors \nfrom over- or under-compensation. Fullerton suggested a new control system \nbased on the twin thumbwheels used in autopilot systems. One wheel con\xad\ntrolled lateral movement while the other offered longitudinal movement. To \nanswer the concern over what would happen to a PCA-controlled aircraft in \nbad weather, Dryden engineer Joe Conley designed and incorporated an instru\xad\nment landing system (ILS) component.33\nPCA in Flight Test: The F-15 and MD-11 Experience\nWith an influx of funds from the Air Force, Burcham went in search of a \nresearch aircraft for the project. NASA Dryden’s extensively instrumented \nMcDonnell Douglas F-15 could be employed for the tests, and the F-15 sim\xad\nulator at McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis would be available for setup and \npreparation of the flight-test program. Earlier projects had left the aircraft \nloaded with test instrumentation from programs like HIDEC, as well as two \ncomputer systems, a digital flight control computer (FCC) and DEEC, which \nwere programmable and capable of communicating with each other in flight. \nResearchers incorporated interim control-system software to produce a slower \nengine response at low power settings to emulate the characteristics of high-\nbypass turbofan engines.

Gordon Fullerton's landing of the NASA F-15 using only engine power to turn, climb, and descend on April 21, 1993, was significant because it proved the capability of the PCA (Powered Lift Control Augmentation) system. This technology was proven for incorporation into future aircraft designs, demonstrating the potential for aircraft to maneuver using only engine power. The successful landing by Fullerton, a veteran test pilot, also showcased the safety and effectiveness of the PCA system. The event was a major milestone in the PCA program and generated enthusiasm among guest pilots from industry and the military who went on to fly the F-15 in a series of trial approaches and go-arounds."
"What was the primary objective of the Luna 17 mission, and what role did Lunokhod 1 play in achieving this goal?","The primary objective of the Luna 17 mission was to land a lunar roving operations vehicle, Lunokhod 1, on the Moon's surface and conduct scientific investigations. Lunokhod 1 was equipped with a set of scientific instruments, including an imaging system, RIF-MA x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, PROP penetrometer, TL-1 laser reflector, RV-2N radiation detector, x-ray telescope, odometer/speedometer, AF-3L visible/ultraviolet photometer, SG-70A tricomponent magnetometer, and a photodetector. The mission was successful, and Lunokhod 1 outperformed its expectations, operating for 11 lunar days (about 21 Earth days) instead of the planned design life of only 3 lunar days (about 21 Earth days).

The Luna 17 mission was launched on April 22, 1968, using a Proton-K rocket with a Blok D upper stage. The spacecraft consisted of a lunar orbiter and a landing module, which separated from the orbiter and landed on the Moon's surface on November 17, 1968. The landing site was in the Oceanus Procellarum region, near the crater Alphonsus.

The Luna 17 mission was part of a series of Soviet lunar exploration missions, which included the Luna 16 mission that successfully returned a lunar sample to Earth in 1970. The Luna 17 mission was also followed by the Luna 21 mission, which landed the Lunokhod 2 rover on the Moon's surface in 1970.

The Luna 17 mission was significant in advancing our understanding of the Moon's surface and geology. The Lunokhod 1 rover was able to travel over 37 kilometers and collect data on the Moon's surface composition, topography, and other properties. The mission also provided valuable insights into the Moon's magnetic field and radiation environment.

The primary objective of the Luna 17 mission was to conduct lunar roving operations. Lunokhod 1, a robot lunar roving vehicle, played a crucial role in achieving this goal. It was the first in a series of lunar roving vehicles, whose concept had begun in the early 1960s, originally as part of the piloted lunar landing operations. Lunokhod 1 was designed and built by VNII Transmash, while Lavochkin retained overall design conception of the vehicle. The descent stage of Luna 17 was equipped with two landing ramps for Lunokhod 1 to disembark on to the Moon's surface. The 756-kilogram rover stood about 1.35 meters high and was 2.15 meters across, with each of its eight wheels controlled independently for two forward and two reverse speeds. The rover was driven by a five-man team of ""drivers"" on Earth who had to deal with a minimum 4.1 second delay. The set of scientific instruments on Lunokhod 1 was powered by solar cells and chemical batteries."
What is the Mars Surveyor program and what are some of its key missions or components?,"The Mars Surveyor program was a small-mission program initiated by Scott Hubbard and his team at NASA Headquarters in the early 2000s. The program's first mission was the Phoenix lander, which launched in 2007 to examine the polar ice caps of Mars. The program's second mission was the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which launched in 2005 and was designed to search for signs of past or present water on Mars. The MRO also carried the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HiRise), which provided detailed images of the Martian surface. The program's third mission was the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), also known as the Curiosity rover, which launched in 2011 and was designed to search for signs of past or present life on Mars. The MSL carried a suite of scientific instruments, including a mass spectrometer, a laser spectrometer, and a drill, which allowed it to collect and analyze samples of Martian soil and rock. The Mars Surveyor program was intended to support NASA's Constellation human spaceflight program, but the program was canceled in 2010 when the Constellation program was discontinued.

In the context of the larger space science program, the Mars Surveyor program was part of a series of ""Flagship"" missions recommended by the scientific community in decadal surveys. These large-scale space science missions, such as the Viking program to Mars and the Voyager probes to the outer planets, were designed to be long lasting and expensive, costing more than $1 billion. The Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover) and other proposed missions, such as two outer planet missions to Europa and Titan, are also part of this program. The decadal planning effort by the science community has proven remarkably robust and successful.

Early exploration of the terrestrial planets, including Mars, was also a significant part of NASA's research program during the 1960s. The Mariner program, initiated by NASA in the early part of the 1960s, proved enormously productive, with satellites sent to investigate the nearby planets. In 1962, Mariner 2 launched toward Venus and in December it arrived at the planet, probing the clouds, estimating planet","['73\nCHAPTER 2\u2002 •\u2002 Funding Planetary Science: History And Political Economy \nMars Surveyor program, launched in 2001. In addition to acquiring science \ndata, and in concert with the Mars Global Surveyor already in orbit, Mars \nOdyssey would serve as a communications link for future rover missions. In \n2003, NASA launched the highly successful solar-powered Mars Exploration \nRovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, with the goal of providing ground \ndata to support orbital observations indicating evidence of past liquid water \non the surface of Mars. NASA selected the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter \n(MRO), which competed with the MER rovers for the 2003 Mars launch \nwindow, as the next Mars mission. MRO launched in 2006 and provided \nthe most detailed mapping of the Martian surface to date. Based on the suc\xad\ncess of NASA’s Explorer and Discovery small-mission programs, Hubbard \nand his team initiated the competitively selected Mars Scout small-mission \nprogram. The first Mars Scout was the Phoenix lander, a project originally \nslated as a Mars Surveyor mission. Phoenix launched in 2007 to examine the \npolar ice caps of Mars. By the end of the decade, NASA had started work on \nthe first flagship mission to Mars since Viking, the Mars Science Laboratory.\nWith an increased budget in the 2000s, NASA’s overall planetary pro\xad\ngram benefited from a high rate of missions. The Discovery program’s \nMESSENGER spacecraft, launched in 2004, became the first U.S. mission to \nMercury since Mariner 10 in 1973. MESSENGER flew past the small planet \nthree times in complicated deceleration maneuvers before becoming the first \nspacecraft to orbit Mercury. In 2001, NASA established the New Frontiers \nprogram for medium-class missions, based on the success of the Discovery \nprogram, and intended to launch a new spacecraft every three years. In 2006, \nthe first New Frontiers mission, New Horizons, lifted off toward Pluto as the \nfirst spacecraft dedicated to the study of the dwarf planet.69 The second New \nFrontiers selection candidate, a solar-powered mission to Jupiter called Juno, \nlaunched in 2011 on a six-year mission. In 2009, NASA launched the Lunar \nReconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Lunar CRater Observation and \nSensing Satellite (LCROSS) aboard the same Atlas Centaur launch vehicle. \nThe two satellites were part of a Lunar Precursor Robotic program, intended \nto support NASA’s Constellation human spaceflight program. President \nBarack Obama canceled the Constellation program in 2010, but LRO and \nLCROSS completed their missions. LCROSS examined a dust plume created \nby the mission’s depleted Centaur upper stage when it impacted the lunar \nsurface, while LRO provided three-dimensional mapping data of the entire \nlunar surface.\n69.\t In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally defined the term “planet,” \nand Pluto fell outside the definition. The IAU designated Pluto as a dwarf planet.', '121\nCHAPTER 4\u2002 •\u2002 DESIGNING MARS SAMPLE RETURN\nThe Senate agreed. The White House continued to promote the initiative, \nand although NASA officials continued to act as if it could be revived, it was \neffectively over.26\nGeoff Briggs at NASA Headquarters had converted the Mars Rover \nSample Return Science Working Group into the Mars Science Working \nGroup in mid-1989. The reconstituted group met in August 1990, where a \nmajor topic of discussion was the ramifications of cuts for Mars science. The \nbudget would no longer support a sample-return mission of any description. \nYet sample return was still a top desire of scientists. Only a few years would \nelapse before it reappeared in NASA’s plans.\nSAMPLE RETURN IN THE FASTER, BETTER, CHEAPER ERA\nDuring the 1990s, NASA embarked on new approaches to developing low-\ncost robotic space missions. This period of experimentation is referred to \nas the “faster, better, cheaper” era at the Agency.27 This era resulted in the \nfirst Mars sample-return mission proposal to make it out of the “pre-project” \nstudy phase into project status. That sample-return project did not last long, \nbut several Mars missions undertaken in the 2000s were influenced by it, \nand the Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity mission is an indirect derivative.\nAfter the loss of the Mars Observer in 1993, NASA created its first Mars \nexploration program proposing a funded sequence of missions rather than \nfollowing its old approach—of seeking funding for single missions via \n“new start” proposals. This program was called Mars Surveyor, and it was \nintended to achieve at least one launch every Mars opportunity (i.e., every \n26 months). Surveyor-funded projects were to be launched in 1996 (Mars \nGlobal Surveyor), 1998 (Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander), and \n2001 (an orbiter-lander pair was planned, but only the orbiter, Mars Odyssey, \nwas completed). The Surveyor program was supposed to launch a two-part \nsample-return mission in 2003 and 2005. Given the small budget allocated \nto the Surveyor program, originally about $200 million a year, NASA struc\xad\ntured the sample-return mission as a partnership with the French space \nagency Centre National d’Études Spatiales, or National Center for Space \nStudies (CNES). \nThe sample-return mission architecture developed by NASA and \nCNES in 1998 involved sending a large lander to Mars in 2003, with a \n26.

The Mars Surveyor program was a series of robotic space missions to Mars conducted by NASA in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was a key component of NASA's long-term exploration strategy for the planet.

Some of the key missions or components of the Mars Surveyor program include:

* Mars Surveyor Orbiter: This was a mission that consisted of an orbiter and a lander. The orbiter was designed to study the Martian atmosphere and climate, while the lander was intended to investigate the planet's surface and geology.
* Mars Surveyor 98: This was a mission that included two spacecraft, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander. Unfortunately, both spacecraft failed during their missions.
* Mars Surveyor 2001: This mission included two spacecraft, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. Mars Odyssey successfully entered Mars orbit and continues to operate today, while the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander was lost during its descent to the Martian surface.

Overall, the Mars Surveyor program played an important role in advancing our understanding of Mars and paving the way for future missions to the planet."
"What was the role of the NACA computers of World War II and how did they contribute to the social transformation during that time? Additionally, describe the background of the first engineers hired at the NACA during the World War II era.","During World War II, the NACA employed women as ""human computers"" to undertake calculations necessary to complete research reports.

Within a short time, this team consisted of more than \n20 African American women. Despite the restrictions imposed by Virginia’s \nlaws, many of these women worked for years at Langley and eventually inte\xad\ngrated into engineering groups focused on flight research and later into NASA’s \nspace\xa0operations.\nThe women working as computers at the NACA found both opportunities \nand challenges. It was a way to use their degrees in the hard sciences in profes\xad\nsions formerly closed to them. Even so, they still found their careers hamstrung. \nThey proved themselves, however, and many enjoyed long-term careers at the \nlaboratory. A few used the computer position as a stepping-stone for other posi\xad\ntions in the NACA and NASA. The NACA computers of World War II were \nonly a few of the thousands of women employed in similar positions in techni\xad\ncal organizations in World War II. They played an important role not only at \nthe NACA, but also in the Manhattan Project, in various other scientific and \ntechnical organizations, and in ciphers and related fields. \nThe social transformation just getting under way in World War II and mani\xad\nfested at the NACA in the story of the female computers was not confined to \nquestions of race and gender. The rise of a professional aerospace engineering \nclass began to be seen fundamentally during this era as well. Perhaps the most \nstriking feature of the first engineers hired at the NACA was how much they \nlooked like mainstream America. At a fundamental level they were “everyman,” \nand they were male through the end of the war. Diligence, excellence in school, \nand an unfaltering devotion to national duty were all that was\xa0necessary. \nIn part this arose because overwhelmingly the NACA’s engineers were of \nmiddle-class background, often military veterans, and usually receiving educa\xad\ntions at state universities.

It represented the rise of an educated, techno\xad\nlogical middle\xa0class. \nWartime Priorities\nIn one of its earliest wartime R&D efforts, the NACA focused on refining the \nshape of wings and bodies; developing devices to improve engine power and \npropeller thrust, stability and control; and protecting planes against ice and', 'Chapter 3:\u2002 Defeating Fascism\n35\nwhen they drove friends to the laboratory and heard about the computer jobs \nwhile there. They went on to careers that extended into the NASA era. \nOfficially classed as “subprofessionals,” these were still exceptionally good \njobs that only a college graduate could aspire to. By a 1942 report, Langley \nemployed 75 female computers. A report noted: “A good number of the com\xad\nputers are former high school teachers. Their ages may average near 21, but there \nare a surprising number nearer 30 years old. There is no restriction because of \nmarriage; in fact, some of the computers are wives of the engineers of various \nclassification[s] here at NACA.”11 Rowena Becker had made $550 a year teach\xad\ning public school in North Carolina. In contrast, she earned more than $1,400 \na year at Langley. A computer’s work varied somewhat based on the research \nproject underway, but the computational work involved fundamentally reading \nraw data, running calculations, and plotting coordinates. They used standard \nslide rules, Monroe calculators, and other calculating machines to support the \norganization’s flight research and engineering endeavors.\nDuring World War II, African American women also found employment as \ncomputers at Langley. In 1943, the first six women—Dorothy Vaughan, Miriam \nMann, Kathryn Peddrew, Lessie Hunter, Dorothy Hoover, and Kathaleen \nLand—had entered the NACA as female computers. Langley, located in a part \nof the Jim Crow South, was segregated and these computers worked in the \nFigure 3-4. Female computers working at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in \n1943. (NASA, L33025)', 'NACA to NASA to Now\n34\nmanner, the NACA became part of the “science team” that went to war, the \n“Scientists Against Time” that later became famous. The NACA agreed that its \nproper role in wartime would be to serve “as an unbiased technical advisor to \nany branch of the government on aeronautical matters.”9\nHuman Computers and Social Change at the NACA\nTo maximize the research of the NACA’s engineers as the agency geared up for \nthe war effort, the NACA began to employ women as “human computers” to \nundertake calculations necessary to complete the research reports so prized by \nthe NACA’s clients. The term “computer” had been in long-term use as a job \ntitle identifying people who performed mathematical calculations by hand or \nwith mechanical calculators. Although there were already “human computers” \nat Langley prior to 1935, all of them were male, so the hiring of the first women \nto perform these tasks proved radical. They found themselves in a men’s club, as \nthe only women up to that point had been in secretarial positions.\nThe first to arrive, Virginia Tucker, reached Hampton, Virginia, just after \nLabor Day in 1935 to join the laboratory’s “Computer Pool.” She found the \ncomputers organized into a central office in the Administration Building. They \ntook the readings from the engineers and worked with them to calculate tables \nsupporting the research. A 1942 report glowed with praise about the work of \nthis group. Many more women would follow, with Tucker herself recruiting \nmany of them. Reading, calculating, and plotting data from tests in Langley’s \nwind tunnels and other research divisions, these women played an integral role \nin research at the laboratory from the mid-1930s into the 1970s. They also \nchanged the social dynamics of the NACA; for the first-time, male engineers \nhad other professionals working with them that were not of the same gender.\nWorld War II dramatically increased the speed of social change at the \nNACA. Virginia Tucker, the first, took a lead in expanding the program. She \ntraveled to universities around the nation seeking women educated in math\xad\nematics and related fields for work in the NACA laboratories. The engineers \ncame to rely on these computers, remarking that they calculated data “more \nrapidly and accurately” than the engineers.10 \nDuring the war, employees at Langley expanded dramatically from fewer \nthan 1,000 to more than 5,000 by 1945. Female computers employed there, like \nwomen employed throughout the war effort, proved critical to wartime success. \nThese computers came from everywhere, answering advertisements in trade \njournals and on pamphlets at colleges and universities as well as being recruited \nby women already at Langley. Some had friends who told them of the oppor\xad\ntunity.

This was \nnot uncommon. \nAll these employees contributed to a culture of innovation at the NACA. At \nevery step, aeronautical innovation presented itself to those involved in devel\xad\noping new technology. The choice of options helped to shape the course of \naeronautics, along with thousands of other choices made by designers at other \nlocations. Gradually a consensus emerged to move in a certain direction with \nthe technology. It did not emerge without complex interactions, differing ideas \nexpressed, mutually exclusive models built, and minority positions eventually \ndiscarded after considering different options.\nA Revolution in Aeronautics\nDuring the second half of the interwar period, significant technological and \neconomic advances came to aviation. The NACA was responsible for several \ngroundbreaking innovations during this period. Also during this time, congres\xad\nsional legislation and appropriations fueled rapid developments in the capability \nof aircraft in the United States. The period has been characterized as a time of \na “revolution in aeronautics.” \nTo a very real extent, aeronautical innovation is an example of heterogeneous \nengineering, which recognizes that technological issues are simultaneously \norganizational, economic, social, cultural, political, and on occasion irrational. \nVarious interests often clash in the decision-making process as difficult calcula\xad\ntions must be made. What perhaps should be suggested is that a complex web or \nsystem of ties between various people, institutions, and interests shaped aircraft \nas they eventually evolved. These ties made it possible to develop aircraft that \nsatisfied most of the priorities, achieving an optimum if not elegant solution.\nThe NACA’s efforts contributed to the development of the first modern airlin\xad\ners. The Boeing 247, based on a low-wing, twin-engine bomber with retractable \nlanding gear, accommodated 10 passengers and cruised at 155 miles per hour. \nIt paved the way for the airplane that represented the revolution in ways unseen \nbefore. The Douglas Aircraft Company’s DC-3 was the most prevalent com\xad\nmercial aircraft developed before World War II. Inaugurated in 1932 as a con\xad\ntract for Transcontinental and Western Airlines (TWA), it was a new all-metal, \nmono-winged, airliner. As a result of this, the famous Douglas Commercial \n(DC) series began. The DC-1 prototype of 1932 became the DC-2 that filled \nthe TWA order and then emerged in 1936 as the revolutionary DC-3 com\xad\nmercial transport. It accommodated 21 passengers while cruising at 180 miles', 'Chapter 3:\u2002 Defeating Fascism\n43\nin the postwar world? The NACA tried to do so, much as did the Army Air \nForces, which planned for peacetime autonomy even while the war was going \non, and Committee leaders sought to define the agency’s relationship with the \nmilitary, industry, and other research institutions in such a way as to preserve \nits autonomy.\nIt was never able to do so. The NACA had changed during the war, and even \nmore important, its clients and the federal government overall had changed. \nThe most serious change was, without question, the institutionalization of \nscience and technology into virtually every aspect of government operations. \nWorld War II brought that about in a way that would not have happened until \nmuch later otherwise. This development ensured that the military services and \nother organizations of the government created vehicles to obtain the knowledge \nthey believed necessary to survive in the postwar world. The model they used \nwas not the one pioneered by the NACA, and explicit rejection of it took place \neven while the war was still under way. The traditional friends and clients of the \nNACA, the uniformed services and the aircraft industry, were generally sup\xad\nportive of a postwar role for the NACA, but they were less willing to turn over \nexclusive responsibilities for R&D to the NACA than before the war. \nEqually important, the NACA emerged from the war a transformed orga\xad\nnization. As a result of World War II, during which the NACA focused almost \nentirely on military R&D, the structure of the aeronautics research system in \nthe United States changed, and the prewar NACA approach became outmoded. \nDuring the war, aircraft companies and the Army Air Forces developed a signifi\xad\ncant in-house R&D capability, and the NACA’s research infrastructure became \nless critical. Despite expansion in its annual budget, which by 1944 exceeded \nthe cumulative total of the Committee’s appropriations from its establishment \nthrough 1940, the NACA declined in relative significance to other R&D agen\xad\ncies. It was easily consolidated into another institution as a result, something \nthat Victory and other Committee leaders had always tried to avoid before the \nwar. Regardless of these developments, World War II was an important tran\xad\nsition point for the NACA. In the postwar era it would engage in ever more \ncooperative ventures, especially with the military services, and emphasize an \nagenda focused on developing aircraft that could go higher, faster, and\xa0farther.']","

"Question: What was the potential risk associated with the use of falsely certified titanium in the Kepler spacecraft, and what actions were taken by NASA to address this issue?","The potential risk associated with the use of falsely certified titanium in the Kepler spacecraft was that the falsely certified titanium could cause the substituted titanium to be a mission catastrophic risk should it fail. This was discovered in late 2008 when engineers discovered that the titanium used to build the spider ring of the spacecraft was falsely certified and made from “substandard and non-conforming titanium,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. In response, NASA inquired into the actual material properties of the titanium and indicated that testing would be done to determine whether the incorporated titanium would be appropriate for the spacecraft. This issue falls under the category of design problems, as classified by Elias, and was identified as a mission catastrophic risk during the operational and mature phases of the program. The root cause of this problem involved design errors, including specification errors, as well as testing or test specification errors. NASA took actions to address this issue by investigating the effects of falsely certified titanium and working with Ball Aerospace and its subcontractors for the Kepler mission. Internal e-mails cited by the media indicate that “it was concluded by the program personnel that the substituted titanium was a mission catastrophic risk should it fail.”","['Chapter 7: Renewed Commitment: Kepler\n279\nBy September 2007, the precision coating process of Kepler’s primary mirror and \nthe integration of the detector array assembly had been completed.126 The spacecraft \nassembly had started, including work with the reaction control system, reaction wheels, \nattitude determination and control, and power. All subsystems had passed their envi\xad\nronmental and performance tests. It was set for launch in February 2009. After much \ndiscussion at NASA Headquarters, the project initiated a Guest Observer program, in \nwhich scientists could propose that Kepler view objects within its field of view but not \nalready in the Kepler Target Catalog. In Paris, meanwhile, the Kepler Asteroseismic \nScience Consortium, comprising over 100 astrophysicists led by Jørgen Christensen-\nDalsgaard, held its first meeting in 2007 to organize an international data analysis \nteam to determine the sizes and ages of a portion of the stars monitored by Kepler.127\nIn late 2008, however, an unexpected technical problem arose when engineers \ndiscovered that the titanium used to build the spider ring of the spacecraft was falsely \nqualified and made from “substandard and non-conforming titanium,” according to \nthe U.S. Attorney’s Office.128 The discovery of counterfeit parts led to a search warrant \nin April 2008 and a federal indictment against Western Titanium Incorporated and \nfour company executives, including CEO Daniel Schroeder, in December 2009.129 The \nindictment accused the company of “knowingly and intentionally” misrepresenting the \nquality of 7,900 parts made of nonconforming titanium to the Defense Department, in \naddition to the parts delivered to Ball Aerospace and its subcontractors for the Kepler \nmission. The titanium was bought at about the same time as titanium bought by the U.S. \nAir Force under military specification MIL-T-9046, reportedly requiring a rolled plate \nprocess in manufacturing, but the parts were alleged to be forged instead. “Titanium \nmade with a forging process results in different properties and the strength of the metal \nis diffused through the finished product,” explained Keith Meyer, Boeing materials \nspecialist.130 (The charges against the four executives were dismissed in 2011.)131\n126 \t\nBall Aerospace.

For each hazard, the team noted \nthe cause, effect, planned risk reduction action, and probability of occurrence, \nincluding the severity of the occurrence. The team constructed a matrix to \nplot the risk using five categories: 1) risks likely to occur frequently; 2) risks \nlikely to occur several times in the program; 3) risks likely to occur sometime \nin the program; 4) risks unlikely to occur; and 5) risks that were extremely \nimprobable. Within each of these categories, the level of severity was identified \nas catastrophic (loss of vehicle), critical (serious damage to vehicle), degradation \nto the program, and safe. \nNASA Enumerates Likely X-34 Failures\nThe team identified nine hazards constituting potential failures.52\nHazard 1: Aerodynamic Loss of Control. The first identified poten\xad\ntial cause of failure was if the aerodynamic models used in the \ncontrol system design did not adequately predict the stability and \ncontrol characteristics of the vehicle. The effect would be “Loss of \ncontrol of vehicle in critical stage of flight (launch, high Mach, \nlanding, etc.).” The planned risk reduction action was “Use of \nconventional planform, with relatively known aero characteristics \n[and] wind tunnel testing of vehicle with supporting computa\xad\ntional analysis.” The current status probability of occurrence was \nrated as unlikely.53 \nHazard 2: Failure of Flight Control System (FCS) Hardware. The \nsecond potential identified cause was the failure of a single FCS \ncomponent of the single string system. For this hazard, the team \nlisted several risk-reduction options A) design redundancy man\xad\nagement in the currently planned single-string system; B) install \na flight recovery system; C) implement an uplinked remotely \npiloted vehicle system as backup; D) conduct additional reliability \ntesting; and E) design and implement a redundant flight control \nsystem. The team listed the current status probability of occur\xad\nrence as likely to occur sometime in the program, again causing the \ncatastrophic loss of the vehicle. Using option A, option C, and', 'Designing and Building the X-34\n147\nHazard 9: Failure of Thermal Protection System. The potential iden\xad\ntified cause was the failure of the TPS to “provide adequate ther\xad\nmal protection to the vehicle, due to flawed thermal analysis or \nmechanical failure of TPS.” The impact of this failure would have \nbeen “Damage to critical structure or systems result[ing] in serious \ndamage or loss of control of vehicle.” For this hazard, the team risk \nreduction plan consisted of a combination of ground testing of \nTPS, previous experience with similar TPS, and expansion of the \nflight-testing envelope. The current probability of occurrence was \nthe unlikely to occur scenario with a critical severity rating. This level \nremained at the unlikely level after taking the proposed risk reduc\xad\ntion action, but with the lower degradation resulting probability.61 \nThe study team made the following recommendations for a backup vehicle \n(and for the first flight vehicle, if possible):\n•\t Provide pilot intervention through remotely piloted vehicle capability \nat least in the terminal area.\n•\t Implement redundancy management into current single string flight \ncontrol system where possible.\n•\t Provide for a parachute recovery system.\n•\t Conduct additional verification and validation of the flight control \nsystem.\n•\t Design a CG (center of gravity) control system to maintain CG \nwithin controllable limits throughout the flight envelope.\n•\t Provide immediate abort capability.\nRecommendations for the first flight vehicle:\n•\t Demonstrate an autoland system on a piloted test bed prior to the \nfirst flight.\n•\t Consider schedule modifications that would include inert drop tests \n(approach and landing test-glide only, no engine used) as early in the \nschedule as possible.\n•\t Conduct early landings on the lakebed.\n•\t Consider removing the second LOX tank during early flights.62 \nFollowing up on its continued interest in risk mitigation, NASA modified \nits X-34 contract with Orbital to approve fabrication of a second flight vehicle \nin January 1998. Mike Allen, then NASA Marshall’s X-34 deputy program \nmanager, commented on the decision, stating that “[t]he purpose of a second \nvehicle is to reduce risk to the X-34 program [noting that] one of the lessons \nwe learned from the Clipper Graham [DC-XA] program is that it is desirable \nto have a second flight vehicle available, especially if it can be acquired at a \nrelatively low cost.”63', 'Orbital Gets a Second Chance\n115\nrisks, you are not taking big enough steps.

A sorry \nstate of affairs.52 [Emphasis added.]\nThere was, of course, a difference between accepting the risk associated with \nan inhabited flight vehicle and the risk associated with an uninhabited one \n(though an out-of-control or disintegrating uninhabited vehicle could itself \nbecome a deadly missile to any in its way).\nIn January 2000, which was well into the X-34 program and just after a \nstring of highly publicized NASA mission failures, Orbital’s Antonio Elias \nproposed “a framework for the analysis and evaluation of mission success risks \nfor reusable launch vehicles (RLVs), assessment of the impact (cost/benefit) of \nrisk mitigation alternatives, and its application to reducing X-34 risks.”53 Elias \ngrounded his evaluation in three assumptions:\n•\t Mission success risk areas include design, interface, and specification \nmistakes; hardware failures; and operational errors.\n•\t Some risks are higher during the early developmental flights, while \nother risks dominate during the operational and mature phases of \nthe\xa0program.\n•\t The nature of mission success risks is different for reusable launch \nvehicles as compared with spacecraft and expendable launch vehicles.\nHe concluded that the history of flight failures for both expendable launch \nvehicles and remotely piloted vehicles revealed root causes of the failures that \ncould be grouped into categories sharing one or more common features. \nAnalyzing and understanding these causes would ease the complex challenge \nof evaluating risk mitigation. Elias classified mission success risks into the three \ncategories that he designated as “A, B, and C.”54\nCategory A—Design Problems: The risks in this category mani\xad\nfest themselves early in the flight program, typically in the first \nflight. Examples of these problems were the Pegasus XL STEP\xa01 \n(F6) lateral autopilot instability, the Ariane V (F501) software \noverflow bug, and the Delta 3 (D3-1) structural mode/auto\xad\npilot interaction problems.55 Elias noted that the root causes \nof problems in this category involved design errors, including \nspecification errors; analysis, such as incorrect aerodynamic coef\xad\nficients (Lockheed/Boeing Tier III Minus) second flight instabil\xad\nity; testing or test specification errors (Athena 1 Ring Laser Gyro']","
The potential risk associated with the use of falsely certified titanium in the Kepler spacecraft was a mission catastrophic risk should it fail, as stated by NASA lead counsel Richard McCarthy. This was due to the fact that the titanium was used on U.S. Air Force F-15s, F-22s, and C-17s, and its actual material properties were not known. NASA inquired into the material properties of the titanium and indicated that testing would be done to determine whether the incorporated titanium would be appropriate for the spacecraft. Despite these concerns, the spacecraft passed its pre-ship review and was shipped to the Cape, arriving on 6 January 2009.

It is also worth noting that the Kepler spacecraft was fitted with a DVD containing the names of millions of people wanting to participate in some small way in a mission to space, as part of the celebration of the International Year of Astronomy 2009.

What was the significance of propeller cuffs in the refinement of aircraft propeller blade design and how did they contribute to the performance of the North American P-51 Mustang fighter and the cooling of radial engine designs such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the Boeing B-29 Superfortress long-range bomber?,"Propeller cuffs, which covered over 45 percent of the blade, were added to the single-engine fighter that was theoretically capable of 400 mph with the right propeller root-shape, but could not yet reach that speed with a conventional propeller root-shape.

In 1939, Langley researchers in the Full-Scale Tunnel investigated a \nsingle-engine fighter that was theoretically capable of 400 mph with the right \npropeller but could not yet reach that speed with a conventional propeller \nroot-shape.

Langley carried on with extensive research on \ncuffs that allowed for the modification of existing blade designs.49 The North \nAmerican P-51 Mustang fighter was modified with blade cuffs for increased \nperformance, and cuffed propellers likewise improved the cooling of radial \nengine designs such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and—very significantly, \nbecause of its notorious cooling and engine fire problems—the four-engine \nBoeing B-29 Superfortress long-range bomber.Three quarter left front close up view of the forward section of a North American P-51B Mustang fighter plane on ground.\nFigure 1-2.

They \ndetermined that the use of propfans helped increase mission duration and loiter \ntime, which was desirable from the perspective of operators.45 Those studies \nworked to overcome the initial industry and operator resistance to the ATP\n.\nThe next phase of the ATP\n, large-scale integration of the propfan technol\xad\nogy, took place from 1981 to 1987. Up to that point, the model tests and \nmanufacturer studies were promising, but it was another matter to incorporate \nthose data into full-scale experimental propfans. NASA initiated the Large-\nScale Advanced Propfan (LAP) project in 1981. Hamilton Standard received \nthe contract for the design, fabrication, and ground testing of a LAP with a \npitch-change mechanism and the production of additional propfans for flight \ntesting. The propeller maker finished the SR-7L in September 1985. Initial \ntests indicated that the blades vibrated in excess of their design threshold, \nwhich placed the program’s major emphasis on structural integrity over blade \nefficiency and noise.46\nAfter constructing the first full-scale propfan assembly, the SR-7L, Hamilton \nStandard sent it to the Propeller Laboratory of the Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase for static testing of aerodynamic performance and blade stability. Since \n1928, the Air Force and its predecessor organizations had operated three large \nwhirl test rigs for the purpose of establishing the strength and endurance of spe\xad\ncific propeller designs. While thrust, torque, centrifugal force, and gyrostatic \nmoments could be calculated mathematically, physically whirling a propeller in \nexcess of a propeller’s operating regime provided concrete results, especially for \ndetermining overall safety. Air Force engineers tested the SR-7L at 1,900 rpm \nat 6,000 shaft horsepower, which generated 9,000 pounds of thrust. Tests con\xad\nfirmed that the design did not present any unanticipated structural problems \nin the blades or weaknesses in the pitch-change mechanism. NASA engineers \nadded new tools to the Air Force process. They used the Air Force’s optical \nsystem and a laser measurement apparatus developed by their fellow researchers \nto measure blade deflection caused by aerodynamic and centrifugal loads. They \nalso made one of the first applications of another innovation, Laser Doppler \nVelocimetry (LDV), to measure flow velocities.47\nThe next step was high-speed rotor tests in the S1MA Continuous-Flow \nAtmospheric Wind Tunnel in Modane, France. Capable of Mach 0.5 to 1 \nperformance, the tunnel was part of the extensive Office National d’Etudes \net Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) in eastern France. Built from a nearly \ncomplete Nazi wind tunnel found at war’s end in Austria and brought across the \nborder into France, the tunnel was capable of evaluating the 9-foot-diameter \nSR-7L at Mach 0.8 at conditions of 12,000 feet of altitude. Two series of tests \nwith the SR-7L assembly in two-, four-, and eight-blade configurations took \nplace from 1986 to 1987. The full loading tests in Modane were limited to two', 'The NACA and Aircraft Propulsion, 1915–1958\n15\nPropulsion Integration: Beginnings \nof Engine-Airframe Matching\nUp to World War II, the NACA was known primarily for its pioneering \nfundamental work in aerodynamics, specifically drag reduction. The NACA \nmodel of engineering methodology centered on experimental parameter varia\xad\ntion, a systematic process of elimination based on repetition and the varia\xad\ntion of parameters until an ideal solution for an engineering challenge was \nfound. The application of that knowledge to making a foundation technol\xad\nogy of the aeronautical revolution—in this case, the radial, air-cooled piston \nengine—aerodynamically feasible became a hallmark of the NACA’s work. The \nAmerican aeronautical community, recognizing the engine’s light weight for \nthe horsepower produced and its simplicity placed a major emphasis on the \nradial engine. New and fast “express” aircraft like the Lockheed Vega benefited \ngreatly from the inclusion of a 450-horsepower Pratt & Whitney Wasp in their \ndesign. Unfortunately, the protruding cylinders of the radial engine—a “wheel-\nlike” engine that is both broad and flat in the airstream—created a great deal \nof drag for an otherwise streamlined airplane.63\nFred E. Weick and his colleagues at Langley addressed the fundamental \nproblem of incorporating a radial engine into aircraft design in the PRT. The \nwind tunnel’s 20-foot opening allowed them to test full-size aircraft structures. \nTheir pioneering work on a new engine-encircling structure, called the NACA \ncowling, simultaneously reduced drag and improved engine cooling.\nThe NACA cowling arrived at the right moment to increase the perfor\xad\nmance of new aircraft, and it became a standard design feature on radial-engine \naircraft, whether high-speed commercial express aircraft, military fighters and \nbombers, or general aviation designs. Famous aviator Frank Hawks flew his \nscarlet-red Texaco Lockheed Air Express, with an NACA cowling installed, \nfrom Los Angeles to New York nonstop in a record time of 18 hours and \n13\xa0minutes in February 1929. Tests of a Curtiss AT-5A Hawk fighter with an \nNACA cowling increased its top speed from 118 mph to 137 mph, equivalent \nto adding 83 horsepower to the engine. The National Aeronautic Association \nrecognized that the NACA’s contribution to overall aircraft design was so great \nthat the association awarded the Committee its first Collier Trophy in 1929 \nfor its innovative work.\nThe combination of aerodynamic streamlined design, radial engines with \nNACA cowlings, variable-pitch propellers, retractable landing gear, and other \ninnovations resulted in the “modern airplane.”64 The Douglas DC series was \nthe most successful of these new aircraft. The first, the DC-1, debuted in July \n1933 with the major innovations of the aeronautical revolution, including \nan advanced NACA-designed airfoil and radial engines covered with NACA', 'The NACA and Aircraft Propulsion, 1915–1958\n35\nif they could provide the answer. One focus was on developing supersonic \npropellers capable of taking long-range transport aircraft into the transonic \nregime between Mach\xa00.8 and 1.2.118 At the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory \nin Virginia, NACA engineers created a “propeller research airplane” by install\xad\ning an Aeroproducts propeller in the nose of a McDonnell XF-88B test bed \n(the predecessor to the far more capable F-101A Voodoo). The flight pro\xad\ngram, which ran from 1953 through 1956, revealed a propeller design that \nwas 79\xa0percent efficient at a speed of Mach 0.95.119\nSuch promising programs appeared to be futile in the early days of the Jet \nAge. At a 1949 NACA conference on transonic aircraft design, a Hamilton \nStandard engineer, having just reported on the results of wind tunnel tests \non a supersonic propeller for a U.S. Air Force contract, remarked that when \nthere was a choice between a propeller and a jet engine, “even if the propeller \nis good, it is not wanted.”120 The aeronautical community faced many devel\xad\nopmental problems with supersonic propellers in the 1950s, and the propellers \nseemed unnecessary if jet technology provided equal or better performance. A \nmajor challenge was reducing the noise that resulted from the shock waves at \nthe blade tips. The four-blade supersonic Aeroproducts propeller on the Air \nForce’s experimental Republic XF-84H propulsion test bed, which offered \nmediocre performance overall, generated such high-intensity noise and reso\xad\nnance effects that it rendered bystanders sick.121 The NACA, which targeted \nforeseeable fundamental aeronautics problems facing America, lost interest \nand disbanded the longstanding Subcommittee on Propellers for Aircraft in \n1957 as the four-decade history of the organization came to an end. Propellers \nas a major research area disappeared in the early days of NASA (established \nin 1958).122\nEstablishment of the Propulsion Systems Laboratory\nThe Lewis Laboratory in Cleveland struggled to keep up with the rapid pace \nof aircraft engine development in the wake of World War II. With a war \nmentality in full effect, the NACA marshaled its resources to help develop \nand refine new aircraft, missile, and rocket engines for the American military. \nDesign work began in 1948 on a facility with expanded capability as tensions \nbetween East and West increased during the early days of the Cold War. Two \n14-foot-diameter and 24-foot-long test chambers, called Nos. 1 and 2, com\xad\nbined the static sea level test stands with the complex Altitude Wind Tunnel, \nwhich recreated actual flight conditions on a larger scale. The new Propulsion \nSystems Laboratory (PSL) opened 4 years later in 1952 as full-out war raged \non the Korean Peninsula. The PSL was the only facility in the United States \ncapable of operating increasingly powerful and complex large, full-size aircraft \nand rocket propulsion systems in simulated altitude conditions.

Many of the questions such as the extensive sta\xad\nbility investigations are of an entirely theoretical character. Others, for example, the \nproblems of simple manipulation and control, are primarily of a practical nature. \nBetween these are to be found the difficult problems in connection with the con\xad\nstruction of the aircraft parts.\nThe production of lift of a propeller.—The generation of a propeller thrust \nwhich is here equivalent to lift offers nothing particularly new. The computation \nhas been performed so often and so \nthoroughly that little remains to be \nadded. The three-blade propeller of \ntapered plan form was also subjected \nto extensive wind tunnel investiga\xad\ntions both as a helicopter and as an \nautogiro propeller. Figure 1 shows a \nmodel of this three-blade propeller \ndriven by a three-horsepower electric \nmotor. The outfit rests on the wind-\ntunnel scales, which measure all air \nforces and moments.\nThe measurements require great care since there are many sources of distur\xad\nbance, the details of which cannot be individually discussed here. One essential \ncircumstance will be mentioned, however, since it also has a direct bearing on \npractical helicopter flight, and that is ground effect. On approaching a sufficiently \nlarge horizontal plane there is a considerable increase in the thrust and to a smaller \nextent also in the torque of a pro\xad\npeller, as soon as the distance \nbecomes comparable with the \npropeller diameter. In practice \nthis effect is very marked. With \na given throttle setting the heli\xad\ncopter lifts off the ground, but \nwith no more power supplied to \nthe engine, does not rise above a \nfew meters. A helicopter without \nsufficiently great excess power \nwill never rise above this “float\xad\ning level.” On the other hand, \nthis phenomenon gives rise to a Photo of a model of a three-blade propeller driven by a three-horsepower electric motor. It is ready for tests in a wind tunnel.\nFIGURE 1.

Propeller cuffs were significant in the refinement of aircraft propeller blade design as they allowed for the modification of existing blade designs, particularly in increasing the blade area. This modification enabled aircraft to reach higher speeds, as demonstrated by a single-engine fighter that was theoretically capable of 400 mph with the right propeller but could not yet reach that speed with a conventional propeller root-shape.

The North American P-51 Mustang fighter was modified with blade cuffs for increased performance, which maximized the aircraft's overall performance. Similarly, cuffed propellers improved the cooling of radial engine designs such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the four-engine Boeing B-29 Superfortress long-range bomber, which were known for their notorious cooling and engine fire problems.

Therefore, propeller cuffs played a crucial role in enhancing the performance of fighter aircraft and improving the cooling of radial engine designs, contributing to their overall efficiency and safety."

The PI's authority should be respected because a PI who disappears into the background between selection and data return may not be able to address future problems before they become crises, and may not have the necessary authority to make decisions that affect the mission's success.

The Genesis project managers were recognized for going out of their way to meet the science team and get to know them and what was important to their research.

This partnership is critical, and the institution puts a high premium \non making a good match between the PI and project manager for new missions, in \nlarge part because a well-founded relationship and close-knit team make addressing \nfuture problems possible before they become crises requiring the attention of senior-\nlevel management and the costs that those incur.\nThe former head of the Space Department at another institution heavily engaged in \nthe design, development, and implementation of Discovery missions—a scientist who \nhas sent instruments to every planet in the solar system—agreed that the partnership \nis key, but the leadership of the PI is critical in the successful implementation of a \nmission, and his or her authority should be respected. When asked about the concept \nthat a PI should stay out of the way of the implementing engineers, he called such an \nassertion “damn arrogant” and shortsighted for those interested in maximizing the \nscience return within available resources.22\nA program executive charged with the oversight of the Dawn and New Horizons \nmissions at NASA Headquarters cautioned that project managers need to be receptive to \nrequests from all sides without taking comments as direction. Communication is critical, \nbut the project manager that is accommodating to everyone—or no one—may become \ndistracted from achieving the defined requirements. Mission success often hangs on \nthe willingness of project managers to listen to other ideas and the judgment to know \nwhen to push back on the customer or team when appropriate, asking for clarification, \nexplaining the effect of such a change on other spacecraft systems, providing technical \ndata that show the change to be unwise, and standing up to management when neces\xad\nsary. Judgment is a key quality necessary in a program manager, as he decides whom \nto trust, how much to verify, and whether a change can be accommodated without \nlosing sight of the requirements necessary for mission success.\nAnother program executive discussed the challenges of PI management of mis\xad\nsions that can exceed a half-billion dollars. Missions that struggle require additional \nmanagement resources, and sometimes different arrangements. On Kepler, repeated \nfinancial overruns during development caused the mission to be redefined from a small, \nfocused Discovery mission to a strategic mission for the astrophysics community, and \nthe role of the PI was later downgraded in acknowledgment of the increased attention \nrequired by the project manager and senior management. The project manager was \nreplaced with another experienced engineer then working in senior management, and \nshe reported directly to the center Director.

Change is not a \npanacea, but it may be a necessary kick-start to the successful completion of a mission.\nPrincipal Investigator\nPIs can employ varied management styles, but each must be available to the mission \nas needed and be willing to act, within the project or with more senior management, \nwhen the success of the mission is threatened. Because it is so difficult to determine \nthe origin of a crisis, the PI must maintain a keen insight into the progress of the \nproject and be ready to act appropriately. PIs must understand rudimentary aspects \nof project management, including effective requirements definition, allocation of cost \nand schedule reserves, systems engineering, and determination of the full impact of \npotential trades. A PI must be fair, reasonable, decisive, slow to anger, and careful to \nconsider the impact of any decision on the mission and the personnel involved. A good \nPI resists scope creep, listens to team members, takes decisive action, and effectively \nrepresents the mission to NASA Headquarters, center management, the science com\xad\nmunity, and the media.\nExperience is critical for both PIs and project managers, although there is no \nclear consensus on what experience would adequately prepare a person to lead a \nhalf-billion-dollar mission. All experience, from that of a co-investigator to an instru\xad\nment developer to a leader of teams, is helpful, and each must be evaluated with the \nmanagement expectations in mind. It is particularly critical that mission leaders have \ndelivered projects or instruments on time in the past and that they have employed \nappropriate support for the scheduling function in mission development to minimize \nthe impact of late deliveries, the end result of many, many technical troubles. Some \nsystems engineering experience would aid in evaluating project plans.\nPIs would be well served to have worked closely with engineering teams at the \nproposed NASA center or federally funded research and development center in the \npast, to understand the engineering culture there, to know and have good relation\xad\nships with center management, to be able to push back on new demands from all sides, \nand to stand up for the project when unfairly affected by failures, delays, or overruns \non other projects at the center. The PI must also, of course, have the experience to \nunderstand when the project is being punished unfairly for another’s mistakes, and \nwhen the new regulations reflect new insights into program and project management \nthat will aid the project in its quest for mission success. An effective PI is aware of the \ndaily challenges but does not interfere with the project manager’s implementation style \nunless it is adversely affecting mission progress.', 'NASA′s Discovery Program\n370\nOn this mission, the science team was rarely involved with the engineers because of \ntheir disparate duties, but project managers before and after landing made efforts to \ntravel and meet the science teams at their meetings and planetary science conferences.\nProject managers emphasized the role of teamwork and a well-defined project \nmanagement relationship over and over in interviews. The Stardust project manager \nduring development reviewed several possible types of relationships, such as the more \ntraditional model where science co-investigators or a science working group pressure \nthe PI to increase scope, the PI does, and then the project manager must push back \nto stay within cost and schedule constraints. This tension can create an “us versus \nthem” mentality, and traditional issues such as poor communication and competing \nrequirements can threaten to derail the project.\nIn Discovery, however, the PI/project manager relationship was established dif\xad\nferently, and this redefinition not only empowered the PI, but it also empowered the \nproject manager because he or she no longer reported only to his or her own line \nmanagement, but also to an outside senior scientist who reported directly to NASA \nHeadquarters for the success of his or her mission. Wise project managers could lever\xad\nage this relationship to push the project forward in the face of adversity. A good team \ncould not only implement spacecraft development more effectively but also answer \nmanagement queries from all levels faster, without delaying project progress. Project \nmanagers would help PIs understand center management concerns, and PIs could \nintervene when outside influences threatened the project. The two would work together \nand build a trust that would allow each to perform their own roles but work together \nas a team when difficulties arose.\nScience benefits when a champion is established outside of the existing engineering \nstructure that has the power to redirect the project back on track as necessary. The \nproject managers recognized this, even writing protection clauses into proposals that \nrequired the PI’s approval before the spending of one penny of reserve. These gates \nintroduced checks and balances into the system, reducing the possibility that engineering \noverruns would erode the science return without careful consideration and approval \nby the primary science stakeholder. The interjection of a PI at this point in the system \ncaused the project managers to think twice about cutting the science budget and to \nresist such cuts if pressured, even directed, by their own line or center management.\nProject managers who have worked with multiple Discovery PIs spoke highly of \nall of them, contrasting their different styles. One gave the project manager the free\xad\ndom he needed to get the job done. Others were more hands-on in the day-to-day \ndevelopment. In every case, any decisions with potential impact on the mission design \nand subsequent performance were discussed thoroughly with the PI, with the project \nmanager laying out a suggested direction, while reminding the PI that he had the', 'Chapter 8: Lessons Learned from the Evolution of the Program\n319\n6.\t Funding Profiles represent a special challenge for PI-led missions because they are planned \nat the mission concept stage with the goals of minimizing costs and achieving schedules. \nHowever, like all NASA missions, PI-led missions are subject to the availability of NASA \nfunding, annual NASA budgetary cycles, and agency decisions on funding priorities, all \nof which can disrupt the planned funding profiles for PI-led missions.\n7.\t International contributions have an important positive impact on the science capa\xad\nbilities of PI-led missions but are faced with an increasingly discouraging environment, \nin part due to ITAR. In addition, logistic difficulties associated with foreign government \nbudgetary commitments and the timing of proposals and selections persist. The result is \nboth real and perceived barriers to teaming and higher perceived risk for missions includ\xad\ning international partners.\n8.\t The program offices can play a critical positive role in the success of PI-led missions if \nthey are appropriately located and staffed, and offer enabling infrastructure for projects and \nNASA Headquarters from the proposal through the implementation stages.\n9.\t NASA oversight of PI-led missions, as well as of all missions, increased following a string \nof mission failures in the late 1990s and is again increasing following the Columbia shuttle \ndisaster. Some of the added oversight, and especially the style of that oversight, appears \nexcessive for robotic missions as small as the PI-led missions. Increases in oversight also \nstrain project resources and personnel to the point of adding risk rather than reducing it.\n10.\t Program Oversight: There is confusion about the processes in place for adjusting PI-led mis\xad\nsion cost caps and schedules to accommodate oversight requirements introduced after selection.\n11.\t The threat of cancellation in a termination review is no longer an effective way of \nkeeping PI-led missions within their cost caps, because few missions have been canceled as \na result of exceeding their cost caps. Nevertheless, a termination review is taken seriously \nbecause it reflects negatively on project management performance and raises the possibility \nof science descopes. [Other] project leaders need to be made aware of problems that lead to \ntermination reviews so that they can avoid them.\n12.\t Descopes: High-impact decisions such as descopes made by NASA outside the termination \nreview process undermine a PI’s authority and can cause a mission to lose science capability.\n13.\t Technical and Programmatic Failures: Lessons learned from experience in both PI-led \nand other missions can be extremely valuable for reducing risk and inspiring ideas about \nhow to do things better. Much useful lessons-learned documentation is available on the Web \nbut is not collected in a coherent library or directory.

When defining roles and choosing his approach \nto management, he purposefully struck a balance between the “PI who gets involved \nin everything and makes life miserable for the investigator and for all the people who \nwork with him” and the PI who disappears into the background between selection \nand data return. Precisely because he wanted to be involved, he made a particular \neffort to find excellent people whom he could trust to work independently but who \nalso would trust him enough to turn back for help when needed. He agreed to take on \nissues at NASA Headquarters, for instance, and to weigh in on technical issues when \nasked. Weekly conference calls helped the team work together between the monthly \nin-person meetings. The PI added, “I tried very hard not to get in the way of people \nwho knew what they were doing,” as he complimented his team over and over again, \nas well as the team he had worked with as an instrument lead on NEAR, one of the \nfirst Discovery missions, implemented before the Principal Investigator mode.19 The \nrelationship between the top technical and top scientific experts on the team is essential, \nand they must be well matched, he said, adding that he always insisted that the two \nshould be able to select each other and that institutions not force relationships between \npersonalities that do not work well together. Successful implementation of a mission \nwithin such tight constraints takes an extremely close relationship. Others, including \nfunding agencies and managing institutions, must honor this as well, however, and \nhe did note that one of the most significant activities for his mission—the Mishap \nInvestigation Board after the failure of CONTOUR’s solid rocket motor burn 42 days \nafter launch—was conducted entirely without the involvement of the PI.

"What are the inferred composition and structure of Comet Tempel 1 based on the Deep Impact mission observations, and what evidence supports these inferences?","The Deep Impact mission observations revealed that Comet Tempel 1 had a slump depression or sinkhole, and had only a few impact craters. The comet was a dark-colored comet, 7.6 miles long and 4.9 miles wide, with an orbital period of 5.56 years. The mission's target, Comet Tempel 1, was discovered in 1867 by Ernst Wilhelm Tempel, a German astronomer. The design of Deep Impact was necessarily different from previous such missions, as this mission would be less an expedition and more an experiment, and the first of its kind in that its impact and observations were both done on flight. The daring Deep Impact design relied on a two-part spacecraft consisting of the flyby spacecraft and a copper smart impactor. To see beneath the surface of the comet, Deep Impact approach would Tempel 1 at speeds greater than 37,014 kilometers per hour—ten times faster than a bullet fired from a rifle—and release the impactor. The 372-kilogram projectile would smash a hole in the comet’s surface, exposing the nucleus beneath. Instrumentation on the flyby spacecraft would concurrently observe the impact at different wavelengths, including optical, to help scientists understand what actually happened during impact and immediately afterward. The task—to hit a comet accurately and observe the results during a single flyby—was daunting, and there would be no second chances. Deep Impact could not reload.

In addition to the Deep Impact mission, the European Space Agency's (ESA) Corot mission, which launched in 2006, aimed to detect and characterize exoplanets using the transit method. The Corot camera was designed to measure variations in a star's brightness, which could reveal the existence and characteristics of planets passing in front of the star. The camera's out-of-focus design, which spread light across multiple pixels, actually helped to reduce noise in the data. This method allowed for the detection of previously undiscovered planets and the measurement of subtle signatures in their transit light curves, such as the presence of moons or rings. The Corot mission was successful in discovering several new exoplanets, including the first Earth-sized planet in a habitable zone, CoRoT-7b.","['Chapter 7: Studying the Rubble of the Solar System\n199\ngiving way and forming slump depressions or sinkholes.

Tempel 1 is a dark-colored comet, 7.6 miles long and \n4.9 miles wide, with an orbital period of 5.56 years. The comet was nothing special, \nall things considered, and the team chose it for convenience.26 And yet, this ordinary \npickle-shaped icy dirt ball held secrets. Jessica Sunshine said of it: “We may finally \nlearn whether these comets…are dirty snowballs, as many astronomers have thought, \nor snowy dirtballs instead.”27\nBecause the nucleus of a comet is hidden beneath its surface and coma, the design \nof Deep Impact was necessarily different from previous such missions. This mission \nwould be less an expedition and more an experiment, and the first of its kind in that \nits impact and observations were both done on flight. (Lunar Prospector, the third \nDiscovery mission selected for flight, collided with the Moon at the end of its science \nphase, but the study and data collection of the collision’s aftermath were conducted \nfrom Earth-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope.) The daring Deep \nImpact design relied on a two-part spacecraft consisting of the flyby spacecraft and a \ncopper smart impactor.\n“With most missions, you send a spacecraft out to fly by something and you look \nat it from a distance,” said co-investigator Peter Thomas at the time. “The fun thing \nabout this mission is we’re doing an active experiment—trying to make a crater in this \ncomet, thereby seeing what’s on the inside.... We don’t have a good idea as to what’s \ngoing to happen.”28\nTo see beneath the surface of the comet, Deep Impact approach would Tempel\xa01 \nat speeds greater than 37,014 kilometers per hour—ten times faster than a bullet fired \nfrom a rifle—and release the impactor. The 372-kilogram projectile would smash a \nhole in the comet’s surface, exposing the nucleus beneath. Instrumentation on the flyby \nspacecraft would concurrently observe the impact at different wavelengths, includ\xad\ning optical, to help scientists understand what actually happened during impact and \nimmediately afterward. The task—to hit a comet accurately and observe the results \nduring a single flyby—was daunting, and there would be no second chances. Deep \nImpact could not reload.\n25 \t\n“Md.

The mission was then renamed the Extrasolar Planet Observation and \nDeep Impact Extended Investigation (EPOXI). Comet Hartley 2’s longest \nextent is about 2.3 kilometers with a bi-lobed shape. A’Hearn described the \nshape as a cross between a bowling pin and a pickle. The smallest of the com\xad\netary spacecraft targets, Comet Hartley 2 was hyperactive, with water vapor \nsublimating from the smooth waist region and CO2-rich jets dragging out \nwater ice chunks, which then sublimated above the smaller end of the nucleus.\nSpace-based infrared observations of Hartley 2 by the ESA’s Herschel Space \nTelescope provided the surprising result that this comet had a deuterium-\nto-hydrogen (D/H) ratio similar to that in Earth’s oceans, as well as some \nmeteorites and asteroids—suggesting that short-period comets may have con\xad\ntributed much of the water to the early Earth.77 However, the six other comets \nfor which these measurements were made had D/H ratios about twice that of \nEarth’s oceans, suggesting that primitive asteroids, rather than comets, prob\xad\nably provided much of Earth’s water. The idea that comets might only be a \nminor contributor to Earth’s water was underscored once the D/H ratio for \nthe Rosetta mission target, Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, was found to \nbe more than three times the value for Earth’s oceans.78\nAfter the successful flyby of Comet Wild 2 by the Stardust spacecraft in \n2004 and the return of the dust samples to Earth two years later, the Stardust \nmission was renamed Stardust-NExT and retargeted to fly past Comet \nTempel\xa0 1 in mid-February 2011.

Doing so would allow the Discovery Program to \nrecover some of the science lost with the 2002 failure of the CONTOUR mission—itself \nintended to do comparative studies of multiple comets.\nThat wasn’t the only idea for what to do with Deep Impact, however. L. Drake Deming \nof Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, wanted to look outward from \nour solar system and find Earth-size planets circling other stars. The Deep Impact \nspacecraft and its powerful planetary telescope was the perfect tool for the job. He \ncalled it EPOCh—the Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization mission—\nand it could take special advantage of Deep Impact’s flawed high-resolution camera.\nTo find planets circling other stars, rather than image them directly, as the Hubble \nSpace Telescope might look at Jupiter or Mars, the project would infer the existence \nand characteristics of a planet or planets, should any be discovered, using transit \ndetection. The camera would measure variations in a star’s brightness. A planet pass\xad\ning in front of a star would dim the star; accordingly, brightness levels, the rate of the \ntransit, and known information about the star, among other data points, could reveal \ninformation about the planet found. Moreover, the camera would observe previously \ndiscovered planets and use changes in known measurements to determine variations \nin cloud structures and measure the planets’ temperatures. Indeed, much more than \nthat might be detected.98\n“We have bright stars that we know have transiting planets, at least one transiting. \nBut, if you stare at them for a long time, they may have another planet in the system \nwhose transit is too infrequent and too shallow to have been noticed before.” Even \nplanetary systems were possible to detect. “The giant transiting planets themselves \nmay have moons or rings or other subtle signatures in their transit light curves that \ncan be extracted from high-precision photometry.”99\nBecause the Deep Impact camera was out of focus, the light from measured stars \nwould be seen not as a single point, but as a gradient across multiple pixels.

Comet Tempel 1 has an albedo of 0.059, a bulk density of about 0.4 grams per cubic centimeter, an extent of 4.4-8.0 kilometers, and an abundance of jet activity. Some of the jets are collimated and produce water vapor (H2O), while others on the night side are rich in carbon dioxide (CO2). The ratio of cometary production rates of CO2 compared to H2O is about 7 percent, suggesting a heterogeneous nucleus.

Spectral observations by the University of Maryland's Jessica Sunshine and colleagues detected water ice in the impact ejecta and in three small patches on the surface of the nucleus. However, these surface patches are too small to explain the total amount of atmospheric water vapor, so most of it must come from subsurface sources. The top few centimeters of the comet's surface are largely ice-free, and the bulk of the H2O and CO2 ices are likely within 1 meter of the surface.

To account for the observed surface layering and the diverse composition of these layers, Arizona researcher Michael Belton suggested a nucleus model consisting of a pile of randomly stacked layers. These diverse layers are thought to have been produced over time by impacts of comets that originated in differing regions of a non-uniform protoplanetary nebula. This model, nicknamed the TALPS model, postulates the formation of layered cometary nuclei by the successive collisions of diverse, smaller, primordial comets.

The evidence supporting these inferences includes the Deep Impact mission observations, spectral observations by the University of Maryland, and the TALPS model, which was developed based on these observations."
"What is the function and significance of the Mercury Dual Imaging System in the MESSENGER Spacecraft, as described in the given context?","The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) is a high-resolution imaging system carried by the MESSENGER Spacecraft, which was selected for flight in 1999 and entered the implementation phase in 2001. The MDIS has a primary function of globally mapping Mercury's surface in high resolution, which is essential for answering scientific questions about the planet's geology, magnetic field, and chemical composition. The MDIS has been crucial in identifying high concentrations of magnesium and calcium on Mercury's nightside, revealing a significant northward offset of Mercury's magnetic field from the planet's center, finding large amounts of water in Mercury's exosphere, and providing evidence of past volcanic activity on the surface. The MDIS has exceeded the original expectation of at least 1,000 photographs, and by the time of the MESSENGER mission's extension in 2012, the MDIS had taken 200,000 orbital images. The MDIS has been a significant contributor to the scientific discoveries made by the MESSENGER mission, which sought to answer six fundamental questions, including the planetary formational processes that led to Mercury's high ratio of metal to silicate, the geological history of Mercury, the nature and origin of Mercury's magnetic field, the structure and state of Mercury's core, the radar-reflective materials at Mercury's poles, and the important volatile species and their sources and sinks near Mercury.","[""234\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016This image acquired by NASA's Messenger spacecraft on October 2, 2013 by its Wide Angle Camera (WAC) shows the sunlit side of the planet Mercury.

Its primary goal was \nto study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical \ncomposition of the planet. It was the first mis\xad\nsion to Mercury after Mariner 10, more than 30 \nyears before. MESSENGER was launched into \nan initial parking orbit around Earth after which \nits PAM-D solid motor fired to put the spacecraft \non an escape trajectory into heliocentric orbit at \n0.92 × 1.08 AU and 6.4° inclination to the eclip\xad\ntic. The six-and-a-half-year road to Mercury was \npunctuated by several gravity-assist maneuvers \nthrough the inner solar system, including one flyby \nof Earth (on 2\xa0August 2005), two flybys of Venus \n(on 24\xa0October 2006 and 5 June 2007), and three \nflybys of Mercury (on 14 January 2008, 6 October \n2008, and 29 September 2009). The gravity-assist \nmaneuvers allowed the spacecraft to overcome the \nproblem of massive acceleration that accompanies \nflight toward the Sun; instead, the flybys helped \nto decelerate MESSENGER’s velocity relative to \nMercury and also conserve propellant for its orbital \nmission (although it prolonged the length of the \ntrip). The Earth flyby allowed mission controllers \nto properly calibrate all of the spacecraft’s instru\xad\nments while also returning spectacular images \nof the Earth–Moon system. During the second \nVenusian flyby (at a range of only 338 kilometers), \nMESSENGER relayed back a vast amount of data, \nincluding visible and near-infrared imaging data on \nthe upper atmosphere. Some of the investigations, \nespecially its study of the particle-and-fields char\xad\nacteristics of the planet, were coordinated with \nESA’s Venus Express mission. The three Mercury \nflybys further slowed down the spacecraft, although \nduring the last encounter in September 2009, \nMESSENGER entered a “safe mode” and, as a \nresult, collected no data on Mercury. Fortunately, \nthe spacecraft revived 7 hours later. MESSENGER \nfinally entered orbit around Mercury at 00:45 UT \n18 March 2011, nearly seven years after launch \nand began formal data collection on 4 April. The \nvehicle’s orbit was highly elliptical, approximately \n9,300 × 200 kilometers with a 12-hour orbital \nperiod. One of MESSENGER’s most remarkable \nimages was its mosaic of the Solar System, obtained \non 18\xa0 February 2011 with all the planets visible \nexcept Uranus and Neptune, a visual counterpart \nto the image of the solar system taken by Voyager\xa01 \non 14\xa0 February 1990. The spacecraft completed \nits primary year-long mission on 17 March 2012, \nhaving taken nearly 100,000 images of the surface"", '171\nMESSENGER: AN AMAZING CONCEPT\nThe MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft, \nor MESSENGER, was, without a doubt, the most ambitious mission ever selected in \nthe Discovery Program.\nIt was the second effort to get such a Mercury mission going. An earlier, $257 mil\xad\nlion (in Fiscal Year 1996 dollars) proposal was selected for a concept study but was \nnot selected for flight. When it was proposed again in 1998, the price had increased to \n$286 million (Fiscal Year 1998 dollars) with a few significant upgrades to the instru\xad\nments, namely: the gamma ray spectrometer became the Gamma Ray and Neutron \nSpectrometer (GRNS), and the energetic particle spectrometer became an energetic \nparticle and plasma spectrometer.\nMESSENGER was thus selected, first for study on 7 July 1999, and then, after \nbeing chosen for flight, it entered the implementation phase on 7 June 2001. At the \nCHAPTER 5\nBreaking the Bank', 'Chapter 5: Breaking the Bank\n179\nAs far back as 2002, the camera team had put thought into their orbital strategy, \ndata collection, polar data acquisition, how they were going to fill in the base map, \nwhat colors were needed, and the minimum number of filters necessary to answer \ntheir science questions about composition.30\nThe role of an Instrument Scientist, according to Prockter, is “to take the science \ngoals from the proposal, the high-level science traceability matrix, and make sure \nthat that instrument can do that science.” That’s not just making sure, on a camera, \nfor instance, that you’ve got the right focal length on the instrument, she explains. \nIt’s much more nuanced than that, involving things like the correct planes and filters \nto do color imaging. “It’s also making sure that once you’re in orbit around Mercury, \nyou’re in the right orbit that your camera’s going to work, you’ve got the right amounts \nof time to do that.” She explains that calibrations done in flight validated the camera’s \nfunctionality and ironed out many of the quirks in the system and bugs in the software.31\nMost instrument scientists on MESSENGER worked for the Applied Physics \nLaboratory, and most of the spacecraft’s instruments were built there as well. The \nlaser altimeter and atmospheric and surface composition spectrometer were built at \nGoddard Space Flight Center and the University of Colorado, respectively. By the time \nthe mission launched, the set of people who had put in at least two months of work on \nthe mission numbered nearly a thousand, over half at the Applied Physics Laboratory.32\nThe instruments carried, spacecraft design, and overall mission were driven by \nseveral factors, including mass. MESSENGER was limited by the heaviest Delta II \nrocket, the 7925H, which had a lift mass of a little over 1,100 kilograms. Propellant \ntook 54\xa0percent of the launch mass, leaving only 508 kilograms of dry mass for its \npayload. To retain the dry mass needed for launch, MESSENGER engineers thoroughly \nintegrated the structure and the propulsion system.33\nRalph McNutt, the MESSENGER project scientist, explained that mass issues came \nin unexpected places, including the wiring harness. Early on, engineers decided to \nuse a smaller wire gauge for the harness, which meant smaller connectors. That led to \nissues because those connectors were not as sturdy and would break.34\nThere were delays in the delivery of key subsystems by subcontractors. A small \ncompany called Composite Optics, which was responsible for the spacecraft structure, \nran late on the project in line before MESSENGER: the Mars Exploration Rovers.

In November \n2011, NASA announced that MESSENGER’s \nmission would be extended by a year, thus allow\xad\ning the spacecraft to monitor the solar maxi\xad\nmum in 2012. The extended mission lasted from \n18\xa0 March 2012 to 17 March 2013. During this \nphase, by 20 April, with the help of three engine \nfirings, the orbital period was reduced to 8 hours. \nIt was also during this period, in early May 2012, \nthat MESSENGER took its 100,000th photo\xad\ngraph from orbit. By this time, the imaging instru\xad\nment had globally mapped in both high-resolution \nmonochrome and color, the entire surface of the \nplanet. It was during this first extended mission \nthat the spacecraft found evidence of water ice at \nMercury’s poles, frozen at locations that never see \nsunlight (made possible by the fact that the tilt of \nMercury’s rotational axis is almost zero.) A second \nextension was soon granted that extended the \nmission to March 2015, and on 6 February 2014, \nNASA reported that MESSENGER had taken \nits 200,000th orbital image, far exceeding the \noriginal expectation of at least 1,000 photographs. \nDuring the second extension, MESSENGER \nphotographed two comets: Comet 2P/Encke and \nComet C/2012 S1 (also known as Comet ISON). \nBeginning the summer of 2014, controllers began \nmoving MESSENGER gradually, burn by burn, to \na very low orbit for a new research program. By \n12\xa0September 2014, just after the 10th anniver\xad\nsary of its launch, the spacecraft’s orbit was down \nto a mere 25 kilometers. Since then, mission con\xad\ntrollers implemented at least two orbital maneu\xad\nvers (on 12 September and 24 October) to raise \nits orbit and continue its latest extended mission. \nBy Christmas Day 2014, it was clear that the \nspacecraft’s propellants were running out and that \nMESSENGER would impact the planet in late \nMarch 2015. On 21 January 2015, mission con\xad\ntrollers carried out one last maneuver to raise the \nspacecraft’s orbit sufficient to continue more sci\xad\nence activities to early in the spring. On 16 April \n2015, NASA announced that the spacecraft would \nimpact the surface of Mercury by 30 April after it \nran out of propellant. As scheduled, on that day, at \n19:26 UT, MESSENGER slammed into the plan\xad\net’s surface at about 14,080 kilometers/hour, cre\xad\nating a new crater on Mercury.

Much earlier, he in fact \nserved on Mariner 10 as deputy team leader for the imaging experiment. “Mariner 10 \nwas a mission that was designed as a reconnaissance of Mercury in order to characterize \nit to plan a Mercury orbiter,” he said. “That orbiter was supposed to be planned and \nlaunched by about 1980. Well, it’s been 30 years.”16\nAs Sean Solomon, the MESSENGER PI, said, “For nearly 30 years, we’ve had ques\xad\ntions that couldn’t be answered until technology and mission designs caught up with \nour desire to go back to Mercury....

The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) is a crucial component of the MESSENGER Spacecraft, as it is responsible for capturing high-resolution images of Mercury's surface. The MDIS is mounted on a pivot that can move up to 40 degrees towards the Sun shield and 50 degrees away from it, allowing it to cover 90 degrees and track the spacecraft's movement across the surface. This feature is significant because the spacecraft is so close to Mercury that it needs a giant sunshade to protect its instruments from the concentrated rays of the Sun. The MDIS's ability to move in tiny increments and cover a wide range of angles is essential for collecting valuable scientific data about Mercury's surface and geology."

The disadvantage is that a pilot has the abil\xad\nity to feel the plane and adapt to its characteristics. For example, a \npilot can attempt to recover from an unanticipated problem while an \nautopilot simply performs the maneuvers it is programed to execute. \nAccordingly, the X-34 was required to have a high degree of mission \nflexibility, thus requiring a high degree of robustness of the autopilot. \n•\t Limited Test Time: The X-34 would have had very limited time \non each flight to perform dedicated testing. This is due to having \na low lift-to-drag ratio resulting in high rates of descent, and to the \nvehicles high degree of power, which once extinguished could not be \nrestarted. For unpowered flights the X-34 would have had approxi\xad\nmately 90\xa0seconds of dedicated test time between drop time and the \nacquisition of the glide slope. For powered flights, the flight condi\xad\ntions would have changed so rapidly that the X-34 could neither fly \nat a constant Mach number or dynamic pressure during ascent or \nreentry. After separation from the carrier aircraft, the vehicle would \nneed to pull up to maintain a normal acceleration of 2.0 g until reach\xad\ning a designated flight path angle. This maneuver was designed as \na compromise between high dynamic pressures and aero loads and \nwould have provided no room for anything other than carry along \nexperiments. During reentry, the X-34 would have been limited by an \nangle of attack profile that would have provided adequate temperature \nprotection, but only subtle changes to these profiles could have been \nmade during these two phases of flight, thus limiting the remainder of \nthe flight to performing dynamic maneuvers or experiments.16 \n•\t Binary Systems: X-34 binary systems included the main propulsion \nsystem, flight controls, flight termination system, and separation from \nthe carrier aircraft. All of these would have needed to work well on the \nfirst use in order prevent loss of the vehicle. This would have required \nadequate ground testing and/or analysis to be performed on each sys\xad\ntem. Also, as many of these systems as feasible should be tested while \nthe vehicle is in captive-carry in order to reduce the risk of losing \nthe\xa0vehicle.17 \n•\t Airspace Constraints: Operational airspace should be a by-product \nof the required mission and not a limitation imposed on good test', 'Promise Denied\n264\nflow separation and reattachment, leeside vortices, and boundary \nlayer—shear layer transition.28\nIn concluding, Miller wrote that\nThese are ideas that floated to the surface in a 15–20-minute dis\xad\ncussion by Ken Sutton, John Paulson, and I. As a last comment, \nthe return to the aeroscience community would be enhanced by \norders of magnitude if qualitative and particularly quantitative \nglobal surface measurements could be achieved. For example, if \ntime histories of infrared emission images could be measured on \nthe windward or leeward surfaces from which global surface tem\xad\nperatures could be inferred. The capability to perform such mea\xad\nsurements may reside in other Government organizations. Wireless \nsensors offering increased numbers and flexibility over conven\xad\ntional measurement techniques would also greatly enhance the \nreturn. Can the X-34 be a test bed for the testing of such\xa0sensors?29\nA May 20, 1998, Space Transportation Program overview of the NK-39 \nengine for potential use in the X-34 noted that the final engine report had been \nreceived from Orbital and Aerojet on April 30. The ground rules for the study \nincluded the following requirements:\n•\t There should be no adverse effects on the first planned launch date of \nthe X-34.\n•\t Either engine must be able to be used on either vehicle.\n•\t No changes to the Outer Mold Line of the vehicle should be made.\n•\t The Fastrac engine would remain the prime means of propulsion for \nthe first flight.\n•\t All proposed changes and impact on the X-34 vehicle must be shown \nby subsystem to include cost and schedule, as well as technical \nconsiderations.30\nThe cost and schedule were requested for two different scenarios. The first \nwas for the purchase of three engines (two flight-rated and one development) \nwith Aerojet serving as a subcontractor to Orbital. The second was for the \npurchase of three engines with an option to purchase two more. A further \nindication of interest within NASA in using these engines for the X-34 was \nthe following handwritten notation on the overview document: “Have Aerojet \nprice the import of all 5 engines.”31\nUnder this plan, Orbital was to provide\n•\t the engine design for the vehicle to incorporate the Russian NK-39 \nengine;', 'Promise Denied\n166\n•\t The X-34 vehicle would not encounter stall up to a 21-degree angle of \nattack in the subsonic and supersonic range and up to a 40-degree angle of \nattack at hypersonic speeds. The vehicle is unstable at low speeds (M\xa0= \n0.30) in pitch at low angles of attack; exhibits a pitch up tendency \nat around a 9-degree angle of attack; and then exhibits a stable break \nwith further increase in angle of attack. The X-34 becomes more \nstable at transonic and supersonic speeds and the angle of attack at \nwhich pitch up occurs also increases. At hypersonic speeds, the vehicle \nbecomes unstable due to the increasing lift developed by the forward \nparts of the fuselage and exhibits a tendency for a stable break at high \nangles of attack. The aerospace engineering team noted that this type \nof variation in pitching moment coefficient is typical of wing-body \nconfigurations at hypersonic speeds. \n•\t At low subsonic speeds, the vehicle has a lift-to-drag ratio as high as 8 at \nlow angles of attack. However, as Mach numbers increase, the lift-to-\ndrag ratio decreases and assumes values ranging from 1 to 2. \n•\t Elevon effectiveness decreases rapidly at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. \nHowever, at a 20-degree angle of attack, the downward deflected ele\xad\nvons still retain their effectiveness up to Mach 10. \n•\t The body flap effectiveness decreases at supersonic and hypersonic speeds for \nangles of attack of 6 degrees. At a 20-degree angle of attack, the down\xad\nward deflected body flap retains effectiveness up to Mach 10. \n•\t At angles of attack of 6 and 20 degrees, aileron effectiveness decreases at \nsupersonic and hypersonic speeds. At an angle of attack of 20 degrees, \nthe downward deflected ailerons retain their effectiveness up to \nMach\xa010. \n•\t Rudder effectiveness increases at transonic speeds, but decreases rapidly at \nhigher Mach numbers. At an angle of attack of 20 degrees, the rudder \nis virtually ineffective above Mach 5. In these situations, the X-34 \nmust use the reaction control system (RCS) for directional control. \n•\t The increment in drag due to speed brake is accompanied by an increase in \npitching moment that can augment the pitch control. The loss of rudder \nand speed brake effectiveness at high angles of attack and high Mach \nnumbers is due to the immersion of these surfaces in the low-pressure \nwake of the fuselage and wings. \n•\t At an angle of attack of 6 degrees, the X-34 is stable in roll up to approxi\xad\nmately Mach 1.7, but beyond 1.7 the vehicle becomes unstable in roll. \nAt an angle of attack of 18 degrees, the X-34 is stable in roll at all \nMach numbers, except around Mach 1.0, due to the increasing sta\xad\nbilization effect provided by the wing dihedral. At an angle of attack \nof 6 degrees, the vehicle is directionally stable up to Mach 1.5, but', '123\nCHAPTER 5\nDesigning and Building the X-34\nThe X-34 Technology Testbed Demonstrator vehicles incorporated features \nand lessons learned from previous programs, including the X-15, the Space \nShuttle, the DC-X/XA, and the first X-34. This chapter reviews the design \nand fabrication of the X-34 vehicles, the vehicle description, the mission \nprofile, influences and project-driving factors, the Orbital team that fabri\xad\ncated the three test bed demonstrators, risk mitigation, and preparation for \nflight testing. \nAn X-34 Design Primer\nThe X-34 drew on previous company experience with the Pegasus launch \nsystem and benefited from technology developed for the Rockwell Space \nShuttle Orbiter, including lessons learned from operating that much larger \nand more complex system. For example, the ascent trajectory and performance \ntargets for the X-34 were similar to those of the first stage of the Pegasus rocket.1 \nAlso, the cost, schedule, and performance requirements of the X-34 required \nOrbital to draw heavily from the first program X-34 configuration for the \naerodynamic design of the vehicle, “which in turn extensively utilized data and \ndesign experience generated from the Space Shuttle program.”2\nThe X-15 as an X-34 Analog\nOrbital also drew upon lessons learned from the earlier Mach 6+ X-15, which, \nlike the X-34, was a hypersonic air-launched boost-glider, though a piloted, \nnot an unpiloted, system. Indeed, as noted by Anthony “Tony” Springer (then-\nResident Manager and, subsequently, NASA’s Alliance Development Manager \nfor Aerospace Technology), the X-15 constituted a veritable analog for the \nX-34.3 The X-15, which flew from 1959 through 1968, was the most success\xad\nful of all American post–Second World War rocket research aircraft programs, \nattaining Mach 6.70 and an altitude of 354,200 feet, figures that remained \nunsurpassed for winged transatmospheric aircraft until the first flight of the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia in April 1981. A comparison, shown in Table 5.1, \nindicates the many similarities between the X-15 and the X-34.', 'Whither X-34?\n261\nthrust was 60,000 pounds]. Although that level of performance \nis considerably more than necessary for the X-34 program itself, \nit could offer a number of advantages for follow-on research.\nThe higher maximum thrust would permit hypersonic flight \nunder flow conditions at which considerable uncertainty exists \nin computational analysis. The higher and variable thrust would \nprovide for sustained flight under a variety of Mach number, \nReynolds number, or dynamic pressure conditions. These flights \ncould acquire research-quality data and correlate that data with \nwind tunnel, computational predictions, or flight data obtained \nby other means. Since much of the flying could be well below \ndesign maximum thrust, the performance margin and the engine’s \nregenerative cooled nozzle might permit an extensive research \nprogram requiring only two or three engines.17 \nWhitehead concluded his memo by stating that “[t]he study cost is esti\xad\nmated at $200K, which I would be willing to support once it is clear that the \nstudy would not compromise accomplishments of 34/RLV program objectives. \nIn that latter regard, I believe the study should be implemented by Orbital \nworking with Aerojet.”18 \nA follow-up note from Bachtel added that Littles spoke with Whitehead \nand agreed on a three-phase approach to conduct a suitable study:19 \n•\t Phase 1: NASA Marshall would assess existing engines such as the \nNK-31 to establish candidate engines that could be integrated into \nthe X-34.20 \n•\t Phase 2: NASA Langley would assess “X-34 vehicle performance for \nthe candidate engine(s) coming out of 1 above. This would include \nan assessment of vehicle-engine compatibility from a flight perfor\xad\nmance standpoint as well as the ability to enhance future aerosciences \nflight\xa0research.”21 \n•\t Phase 3: Orbital would be tasked to conduct an in-depth assessment, \nif warranted by phases 1 and 2 findings, and eventually submit an \nimplementation proposal. Bachtel proposed a four-person team with \nAlberto Duarte, of NASA Marshall, serving as team lead and under\xad\ntaking most of the work. Two of the team members, John Hudiburg \nand Jimmy Lee, “would be consultants only to minimize impact to \nthe baseline X-34 program.”22 \nOn September 23, Littles responded:\nI agree that enhancing the X-34 flight performance with as alter\xad\nnate engine, if available, could provide a valuable asset to this']","

The X-34 is a reusable launch vehicle developed by NASA and Orbital Sciences Corporation in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was designed to test new technologies for future spacecraft, including autonomous flight control, lightweight materials, and advanced propulsion systems.

What is the purpose of the MESSENGER mission to Mercury?,"The purpose of the MESSENGER mission to Mercury was to study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical composition of the planet. The mission's instrument payload consisted of the Mercury Dual Imaging System, a Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, an X-Ray Spectrometer, a magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, and an Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer, as well as a radio science investigation. The mission aimed to answer questions about the planet's density, magnetic field, geology, and the possibility of water ice and other frozen volatile materials in its permanently shadowed polar craters.","[""234\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016This image acquired by NASA's Messenger spacecraft on October 2, 2013 by its Wide Angle Camera (WAC) shows the sunlit side of the planet Mercury.

Its primary goal was \nto study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical \ncomposition of the planet. It was the first mis\xad\nsion to Mercury after Mariner 10, more than 30 \nyears before. MESSENGER was launched into \nan initial parking orbit around Earth after which \nits PAM-D solid motor fired to put the spacecraft \non an escape trajectory into heliocentric orbit at \n0.92 × 1.08 AU and 6.4° inclination to the eclip\xad\ntic. The six-and-a-half-year road to Mercury was \npunctuated by several gravity-assist maneuvers \nthrough the inner solar system, including one flyby \nof Earth (on 2\xa0August 2005), two flybys of Venus \n(on 24\xa0October 2006 and 5 June 2007), and three \nflybys of Mercury (on 14 January 2008, 6 October \n2008, and 29 September 2009). The gravity-assist \nmaneuvers allowed the spacecraft to overcome the \nproblem of massive acceleration that accompanies \nflight toward the Sun; instead, the flybys helped \nto decelerate MESSENGER’s velocity relative to \nMercury and also conserve propellant for its orbital \nmission (although it prolonged the length of the \ntrip). The Earth flyby allowed mission controllers \nto properly calibrate all of the spacecraft’s instru\xad\nments while also returning spectacular images \nof the Earth–Moon system. During the second \nVenusian flyby (at a range of only 338 kilometers), \nMESSENGER relayed back a vast amount of data, \nincluding visible and near-infrared imaging data on \nthe upper atmosphere. Some of the investigations, \nespecially its study of the particle-and-fields char\xad\nacteristics of the planet, were coordinated with \nESA’s Venus Express mission. The three Mercury \nflybys further slowed down the spacecraft, although \nduring the last encounter in September 2009, \nMESSENGER entered a “safe mode” and, as a \nresult, collected no data on Mercury. Fortunately, \nthe spacecraft revived 7 hours later. MESSENGER \nfinally entered orbit around Mercury at 00:45 UT \n18 March 2011, nearly seven years after launch \nand began formal data collection on 4 April. The \nvehicle’s orbit was highly elliptical, approximately \n9,300 × 200 kilometers with a 12-hour orbital \nperiod. One of MESSENGER’s most remarkable \nimages was its mosaic of the Solar System, obtained \non 18\xa0 February 2011 with all the planets visible \nexcept Uranus and Neptune, a visual counterpart \nto the image of the solar system taken by Voyager\xa01 \non 14\xa0 February 1990. The spacecraft completed \nits primary year-long mission on 17 March 2012, \nhaving taken nearly 100,000 images of the surface"", 'NACA to NASA to Now\n128\n18 February 2021 to undertake a multiyear mission to explore the Jezero Crater \non the western edge of the Isidis Planitia impact basin on Mars. Carrying a \nunique mini-helicopter, named Ingenuity, the mission tests the possibility of \nextending research on Mars using low-level flying vehicles. None of these mis\xad\nsions have yet solved the riddle of whether or not life has ever existed on Mars, \nbut all helped establish possibilities that such may have been the case. \nAt present, there are a few scientists who would go so far as to theorize \nthat perhaps some water is still present deep inside the planet. If so, micro\xad\norganisms might still be living beneath Mars’s polar caps or in subterranean \nhot springs warmed by vents from the Martian core. Scientists are quick to \nadd, however, that these are unproven theories for which evidence has not yet \nbeen\xa0discovered. \nOrbiting Mercury\nWhile other spacecraft had flown briefly in the vicinity of Mercury, the closest \nplanet to the Sun, not until 2004 did NASA launch the first mission to orbit \nand take a full measure of readings about the planet. Following a trajectory that \nrequired six planetary flybys, six propulsive maneuvers, and about six and a half \nyears, MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, \nGEochemistry, and Ranging) reached that sweltering terrestrial planet. The \nmission team significantly expanded the envelope of engineering practice, with \nthe first operational demonstration of solar sailing using a large kite-like object \nto capture the solar wind. \nPrior to the MESSENGER mission, Mercury was poorly understood, \nbut as the nearest planet to the Sun and the smallest of the four rocky plan\xad\nets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—it offered a critical anchor point \nfor understanding the solar system. During its operation between reaching \nMercury orbit on 17 March 2011 and the end of the program on 30 April 2015, \nMESSENGER’s science team found a number of surprising results, including \nflooding and explosive volcanism in early Mercury history, contraction of plan\xad\netary geology on a global scale, a magnetic dipole aligned with the planet’s spin \naxis, 60 to 70 percent iron contained in the planet’s interior, and compelling \nsupport for the hypothesis that Mercury harbors abundant water ice and other \nfrozen volatile materials in its permanently shadowed polar craters. \nReconnoitering the Outer Solar System\nAs NASA pursued science missions in the 1970s, it seized an opportunity avail\xad\nable every 176 years when gas giants in the outer solar system gathered on one', 'Chapter 5: Breaking the Bank\n177\nlasts two Mercury years. It has the highest intrinsic density of any planet; the density is \nso high that two-thirds of the planet must be iron metal.”23 A mission to Mercury, ulti\xad\nmately, is a mission to the innermost part of the nebula out of which the planets formed.24\nBefore MESSENGER, not much was known about Mercury. Its density and mag\xad\nnetic field were comparable to Earth’s, but the planet is much smaller and made mostly \nof metal. All this was so, perhaps, because the interior region of the solar nebula was \nenriched in metals. Or maybe the planet was originally covered with a rocky surface \nthat baked off in the intense heat caused by its proximity to the Sun. Or it could be \nthat the crust broke off in an early impact. MESSENGER’s instruments, by measuring \nthe composition of the crust, would likely be able to distinguish between the three \nhypotheses and determine the planet’s original composition and its evolution. Moreover, \nthere was evidence that an unexpected material might be found in Mercury’s craters \nat the poles that are never exposed to sunlight. This material might have been frozen \nwater ice, comet-delivered sulfur, or silicates, hidden in the dark crevices that stay very \ncold, hundreds of degrees below zero.\nIts oddly strong magnetic field and unknown core size and composition were also \nunexplained. Did it possess a spinning liquid outer core?25 Its geology was curious as \nwell, including its giant escarpments sometimes a mile high and hundreds of miles \nacross, formed most likely when the planet cooled.26\nTo answer those and other questions, MESSENGER’s instrument payload consisted \nof the Mercury Dual Imaging System, a Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, an \nX-Ray Spectrometer (XRS), a magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury \nAtmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS), and an Energetic \nParticle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS), as well as a radio science investigation.27\n23 \t\nIbid.\n24 \t\nSpotts, P.

"What is the primary objective of the MESSENGER mission to Mercury, as indicated in the provided context information?","The primary objective of the MESSENGER mission to Mercury, as indicated in the provided context information, is to answer six fundamental questions, which trace their heritage back to the 1978 COMPLEX report coauthored by Solomon. These questions are:

1.	 What planetary formational processes led to Mercury’s high ratio of metal to silicate?
2.	 What is the geological history of Mercury?
3.	 What are the nature and origin of Mercury’s magnetic field?
4.	 What are the structure and state of Mercury’s core?
5.	 What are the radar-reflective materials at Mercury’s poles?
6.	 What are the important volatile species and their sources and sinks near Mercury?

The MESSENGER mission seeks to advance Mercury science immeasurably and answer these questions by orbiting and taking a full measure of readings about the planet. During its operation between reaching Mercury orbit on 17 March 2011 and the end of the program on 30 April 2015, MESSENGER’s science team found a number of surprising results, including flooding and explosive volcanism in early Mercury history, contraction of planetary geology on a global scale, a magnetic dipole aligned with the planet’s spin axis, 60 to 70 percent iron contained in the planet’s interior, and compelling support for the hypothesis that Mercury harbors abundant water ice and other frozen volatile materials in its permanently shadowed polar craters.","['206\nMESSENGER\nNation: USA (84)\nObjective(s): Mercury orbit\nSpacecraft: MESSENGER\nSpacecraft Mass: 1,107.9 kg\nMission Design and Management: NASA / APL\nLaunch Vehicle: Delta 7925H (no.

None of these mis\xad\nsions have yet solved the riddle of whether or not life has ever existed on Mars, \nbut all helped establish possibilities that such may have been the case. \nAt present, there are a few scientists who would go so far as to theorize \nthat perhaps some water is still present deep inside the planet. If so, micro\xad\norganisms might still be living beneath Mars’s polar caps or in subterranean \nhot springs warmed by vents from the Martian core. Scientists are quick to \nadd, however, that these are unproven theories for which evidence has not yet \nbeen\xa0discovered. \nOrbiting Mercury\nWhile other spacecraft had flown briefly in the vicinity of Mercury, the closest \nplanet to the Sun, not until 2004 did NASA launch the first mission to orbit \nand take a full measure of readings about the planet. Following a trajectory that \nrequired six planetary flybys, six propulsive maneuvers, and about six and a half \nyears, MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, \nGEochemistry, and Ranging) reached that sweltering terrestrial planet. The \nmission team significantly expanded the envelope of engineering practice, with \nthe first operational demonstration of solar sailing using a large kite-like object \nto capture the solar wind. \nPrior to the MESSENGER mission, Mercury was poorly understood, \nbut as the nearest planet to the Sun and the smallest of the four rocky plan\xad\nets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—it offered a critical anchor point \nfor understanding the solar system.

An earlier, $257 mil\xad\nlion (in Fiscal Year 1996 dollars) proposal was selected for a concept study but was \nnot selected for flight. When it was proposed again in 1998, the price had increased to \n$286 million (Fiscal Year 1998 dollars) with a few significant upgrades to the instru\xad\nments, namely: the gamma ray spectrometer became the Gamma Ray and Neutron \nSpectrometer (GRNS), and the energetic particle spectrometer became an energetic \nparticle and plasma spectrometer.\nMESSENGER was thus selected, first for study on 7 July 1999, and then, after \nbeing chosen for flight, it entered the implementation phase on 7 June 2001. At the \nCHAPTER 5\nBreaking the Bank', 'Chapter 5: Breaking the Bank\n175\nThe 2001 selection of MESSENGER for flight promised to advance Mercury sci\xad\nence immeasurably. NASA had not sent a spacecraft to Mercury since Mariner 10 in \n1974.14 Robert Strom, a professor emeritus at the University of Arizona Lunar and \nPlanetary Laboratory, had been lobbying for a return to Mercury since NASA’s last \nforay there.15 He became a co-investigator on MESSENGER. Much earlier, he in fact \nserved on Mariner 10 as deputy team leader for the imaging experiment. “Mariner 10 \nwas a mission that was designed as a reconnaissance of Mercury in order to characterize \nit to plan a Mercury orbiter,” he said. “That orbiter was supposed to be planned and \nlaunched by about 1980. Well, it’s been 30 years.”16\nAs Sean Solomon, the MESSENGER PI, said, “For nearly 30 years, we’ve had ques\xad\ntions that couldn’t be answered until technology and mission designs caught up with \nour desire to go back to Mercury.... Now we are ready.”17 A mission to Mercury had been \nstudied by both the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center, but \nthe costs in every case precluded its execution. The Mercury Dual Orbiter, a Goddard \nconcept and the last studied by the planetary program, came in at around $700 mil\xad\nlion. (MESSENGER was less than half that price.) The price tag, coupled with the \nrelatively low priority of Mercury exploration at NASA, meant it would never get the \ntraction necessary for flight. Discovery was a paradigm shift, though. The New Frontier \nprogram did not yet exist; Discovery was the only way such a mission would ever fly.\nScientific Questions\nMESSENGER sought to answer six fundamental questions, which trace their heritage \nback to the 1978 COMPLEX report coauthored by Solomon.\n1.\t What planetary formational processes led to Mercury’s high ratio of metal to \nsilicate?\n2.\t What is the geological history of Mercury?\n3.\t What are the nature and origin of Mercury’s magnetic field?\n4.\t What are the structure and state of Mercury’s core?\n5.\t What are the radar-reflective materials at Mercury’s poles?\n6.\t What are the important volatile species and their sources and sinks near \nMercury?18\n14 \t\nIbid.\n15 \t\nStauffer, T.

Among its initial discoveries was find\xad\ning high concentrations of magnesium and calcium \non Mercury’s nightside, identifying a significant \nnorthward offset of Mercury’s magnetic field from \nthe planet’s center, finding large amounts of water \nin Mercury’s exosphere, and revealing evidence of \npast volcanic activity on the surface. In November \n2011, NASA announced that MESSENGER’s \nmission would be extended by a year, thus allow\xad\ning the spacecraft to monitor the solar maxi\xad\nmum in 2012. The extended mission lasted from \n18\xa0 March 2012 to 17 March 2013. During this \nphase, by 20 April, with the help of three engine \nfirings, the orbital period was reduced to 8 hours. \nIt was also during this period, in early May 2012, \nthat MESSENGER took its 100,000th photo\xad\ngraph from orbit. By this time, the imaging instru\xad\nment had globally mapped in both high-resolution \nmonochrome and color, the entire surface of the \nplanet. It was during this first extended mission \nthat the spacecraft found evidence of water ice at \nMercury’s poles, frozen at locations that never see \nsunlight (made possible by the fact that the tilt of \nMercury’s rotational axis is almost zero.) A second \nextension was soon granted that extended the \nmission to March 2015, and on 6 February 2014, \nNASA reported that MESSENGER had taken \nits 200,000th orbital image, far exceeding the \noriginal expectation of at least 1,000 photographs. \nDuring the second extension, MESSENGER \nphotographed two comets: Comet 2P/Encke and \nComet C/2012 S1 (also known as Comet ISON). \nBeginning the summer of 2014, controllers began \nmoving MESSENGER gradually, burn by burn, to \na very low orbit for a new research program. By \n12\xa0September 2014, just after the 10th anniver\xad\nsary of its launch, the spacecraft’s orbit was down \nto a mere 25 kilometers. Since then, mission con\xad\ntrollers implemented at least two orbital maneu\xad\nvers (on 12 September and 24 October) to raise \nits orbit and continue its latest extended mission. \nBy Christmas Day 2014, it was clear that the \nspacecraft’s propellants were running out and that \nMESSENGER would impact the planet in late \nMarch 2015. On 21 January 2015, mission con\xad\ntrollers carried out one last maneuver to raise the \nspacecraft’s orbit sufficient to continue more sci\xad\nence activities to early in the spring. On 16 April \n2015, NASA announced that the spacecraft would \nimpact the surface of Mercury by 30 April after it \nran out of propellant. As scheduled, on that day, at \n19:26 UT, MESSENGER slammed into the plan\xad\net’s surface at about 14,080 kilometers/hour, cre\xad\nating a new crater on Mercury. Impact coordinates \nwere probably close to 54.4° N / 149.9° W, near \nthe Janácek crater in Suisei Planitia.']","
The primary objective of the MESSENGER mission to Mercury, as indicated in the provided context information, is to answer questions about Mercury's high density, magnetic field, unknown core size and composition, geology, and the presence of an unexpected material in its polar craters. The mission aims to determine the planet's original composition and its evolution, as well as to distinguish between different hypotheses regarding the planet's formation and history. The MESSENGER spacecraft carries various instruments, including the Mercury Dual Imaging System, a Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, an X-Ray Spectrometer, a magnetometer, the Mercury Laser Altimeter, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, and an Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer, to achieve these objectives."
What are vortex filaments and how do they relate to the circulation theorem in fluid dynamics?,"Vortex filaments are lines in a fluid that form the boundary of a vortex tube, and at any instant, the particles of a fluid that belong to a vortex filament always remain in it. The strength of a vortex filament throughout its extent and for all time has the same value. The circulation theorem in fluid dynamics states that the circulation around any closed line is equal to the algebraic sum of the vortex strengths of all the filaments which cross a surface having the closed line as its boundary. This theorem is a consequence of a known theorem of Stokes, and it follows that if a portion of the filament is stretched, say, to double its length, and thereby its cross section made one-half as great, then the rotation is doubled, because the strength of the vortex, the product of the rotation and the cross section, must remain the same. The vector expressing the rotation is changed in magnitude and direction exactly as the distance between two neighboring particles on the axis of the filament is changed.
In the case of potential flow, the flow is without change in volume, and the velocity potential exists. The velocity components u, v, w are connected with the potential Φ by the following equations:
	
u = ∂ϕ
∂x,  v = ∂ϕ
∂y ,  w = ∂ϕ
∂z,	
(3)
The fact that the flow takes place without any change in volume is expressed by stating that as much flows out of every element of volume as flows in. This leads to the equation:
	
∂u
∂x + ∂v
∂y + ∂w
∂z = 0	
(4)
In the case of potential flow, the circulation is zero for every closed fluid line, and the rotation in it is always zero. However, if the fluid is divided due to bodies being present in it, the theorem under consideration does not apply to the fluid layer in which the divided flow reunites.
The concept of rotation can be derived from the circulation, which is convenient for many considerations. The component of the rotation with reference to any axis is obtained if the circulation is taken around an elementary surface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis. The total rotation is a vector and is obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular axes. In","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n230\nparticles of the fluid which at any one time have formed the boundary of a vortex \ntube will continue to form its boundary. From the consideration of the circulation \nalong a closed line enclosing the vortex tube, we see that this circulation—i.e., \nthe strength of our vortex tube—has the same value at all times. Thus we have \nobtained the theorems of Helmholtz, which now can be expressed as follows, call\xad\ning the contents of a vortex tube a “vortex filament”: “The particles of a fluid which \nat any instant belong to a vortex filament always remain in it; the strength of a vor\xad\ntex filament throughout its extent and for all time has the same value.” From this \nfollows, among other things, that if a portion of the filament is stretched, say, to \ndouble its length, and thereby its cross section made one-half as great, then the rota\xad\ntion is doubled, because the strength of the vortex, the product of the rotation and \nthe cross section, must remain the same. We arrive, therefore, at the result that the \nvector expressing the rotation is changed in magnitude and direction exactly as the \ndistance between two neighboring particles on the axis of the filament is changed.\n8. From the way the strengths of vortices have been defined it follows for a \nspace filled with any arbitrary vortex filaments, as a consequence of a known theo\xad\nrem of Stokes, that the circulation around any closed line is equal to the algebraic \nsum of the vortex strengths of all the filaments which cross a surface having the \nclosed line as its boundary. If this closed line is in any way continuously changed \nso that filaments are thereby cut, then evidently the circulation is changed, accord\xad\ning to the extent of the strengths of the vortices which are cut. Conversely we may \nconclude from the circumstance that the circulation around a closed line (which \nnaturally can not be a fluid line) is changed by a definite amount by a certain dis\xad\nplacement, that by the displacement vortex strength of this amount will be cut, or \nexpressed differently, that the surface passed over by the closed line in its displace\xad\nment is traversed by vortex filaments whose strengths add up algebraically to the \namount of the change in the circulation.\nThe theorems concerning vortex motion are specially important because in \nmany cases it is easier to make a statement as to the shape of the vortex filaments \nthan as to the shape of the stream lines, and because there is a mode of calculation \nby means of which the velocity at any point of the space may be determined from \na knowledge of the distribution of the rotation. This formula, so important for us, \nmust now be discussed. If Γ is the strength of a thin vortex filament and ds an ele\xad\nment of its medial line, and if, further, r is the distance from the vortex element to \na point P at which the velocity is to be calculated, finally if α is the angle between \nds and r, then the amount of the velocity due to the vortex element is\n\tEquation 6: d v equals Gamma d s sin alpha over 4 pi r squared\nEquation 6: d v equals Gamma d s sin alpha over 4 pi r squaredEquation 6: d v equals Gamma d s sin alpha over 4 pi r squaredΓ ds sin α\n4 π r2 E\t\nquation 6: d v equals Gamma d s sin alpha over 4 pi r squared\nthe direction of this contribution to the velocity is perpendicular to the plane of \nds and r.

Vortex filaments correspond in it to the electric \ncurrents, and the vector of the velocity to the vector of the magnetic field.\nAs an example we may take an infinitely long straight vortex filament. The \ncontributions to the velocity at a point P are all in the same direction, and the total \nvelocity can be determined by a simple integration of equation (6).

The circulation for every \nclosed line which goes once around a single fila\xad\nment must therefore coincide with its strength. \nIf the velocity at a point of a circle of radius \nh around our straight filament equals v then this circulation equals a “path\ntimes velocity” = 2πh times v, whence immediately follows v = Γ\n2πh . The more exact \ninvestigation of this velocity field shows that for every point outside the filament \n(and the formula applies only to such points) the rotation is zero, so that in fact we \nare treating the case of a velocity distribution in which only along the axis does \nrotation prevail, at all other points rotation is not present.\nFor a finite portion of a straight vortex filament the preceding calculation gives \nthe value\n\tEquation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 2\nEquation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 2Equation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 2 Γ\n4πh Equation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 2Equation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 21Equation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 2Equation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 22E\t\nquation 6b: v = gamma over 4 pi h times cos alpha 1 minus cos alpha 2\nThis formula may be applied only for a series of portions of vortices which \ntogether give an infinite or a closed line. The velocity field of a single portion of a \nfilament would require rotation also outside the filament, in the sense that from the \nend of the portion of the filament vortex lines spread out in all the space and then \nall return together at the beginning of the portion.

If one wishes to represent the flow around solid bodies in a fluid, one can in \nmany cases proceed by imagining the place of the solid bodies taken by the fluid, in \nthe interior of which disturbances of flow (singularities) are introduced, by which \nthe flow is so altered that the boundaries of the bodies become streamline surfaces. \nFor such hypothetical constructions in the interior of the space actually occupied \nby the body, one can assume, for instance, any suitably selected vortices, which, \nhowever, since they are only imaginary, need not obey the laws of Helmholtz. As \nwe shall see later, such imaginary vortices can be the seat of lifting forces. Sources \nand sinks also, i.e., points where fluid continuously appears, or disappears, offer a \nuseful method for constructions of this kind. While vortex filaments can actually \noccur in the fluid, such sources and sinks may be assumed only in that part of the \nspace which actually is occupied by the body, since they represent a phenomenon \nwhich can not be realized. A contradiction of the law of the conservation of matter \nis avoided, however, if there are assumed to be inside the body both sources and \nsinks, of equal strengths, so that the fluid produced by the sources is taken back \nagain by the sinks.\nThe method of sources and sinks will be described in greater detail when cer\xad\ntain practical problems are discussed; but at this point, to make the matter clearer, \nthe distribution of velocities in the case of a source may be described. It is very sim\xad\nple, the flow takes place out from the source uniformly on all sides in the direction \nof the radii. Let us describe around the point source a concentric spherical surface, \nthen, if the fluid output per second is Q, the velocity at the surface\xa0is\n\tEquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squared\nEquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squaredEquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squared\nQ\n4 π r2 E\t\nquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squared\nthe velocity therefore decreases inversely proportional to the square of the distance. \nThe flow is a potential one, the potential comes out (as line-integral along the radius)\n\tEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squared\nEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squaredEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squared\nQ\n4 π r \t\nEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squared\nIf a uniform velocity toward the right of the whole fluid mass is superimposed \non this velocity distribution—while the point source remains stationary—then a \nflow is obtained which, at a considerable distance from the source, is in straight lines \nfrom left to right. The fluid coming out of the source is therefore pressed toward the \nright (see fig. 5); it fills, at some distance from the source, a cylinder whose diameter \nmay be determined easily. If V is the velocity of the uniform flow, the radius r of \nthe cylinder is given by the condition Q = πrsquared · V. All that is necessary now is to \nassume on the axis of the source further to the right a sink of the same strength as \nthe source for the whole mass of fluid from the source to vanish in this, and the', '227\nDocument 5-17 (a–c)\narises which will remain if afterwards the plate is \nquickly withdrawn in its own plane. See figure 2.\n2.\t In order that the theorem may apply, we must \nexclude mass forces of such a character that work \nis furnished by them along a path which returns \non itself. Such forces do not ordinarily arise and \nneed not be taken into account here, where we are \nconcerned regularly only with gravity.\n3.\t The fluid must be homogeneous, i.e., of the same density at all points. We \ncan easily see that in the case of nonuniform density circulation can arise \nof itself in the course of time if we think of the natural ascent of heated air \nin the midst of cold air. The circulation increases continuously along a line \nwhich passes upward in the warm air and returns downward in the cold air.\nFrequently the case arises that the fluid at the beginning is at rest or in abso\xad\nlutely uniform motion, so that the circulation for every imaginable closed line in \nthe fluid is zero. Our theorem then says that for every closed line that can arise \nfrom one of the originally closed lines the circulation remains zero, in which we \nmust make exception, as mentioned above, of those lines which are cut by bodies. \nIf the line integral along every closed line is zero, the line integral for an open curve \nfrom a definite point O to an arbitrary point P is independent of the selection of \nthe line along which the integral is taken (if this were not so, and if the integrals \nalong two lines from O to P were different, it is evident that the line integral along \nthe closed curve OPO would not be zero, which contradicts our premise). The line \nintegral along the line OP depends, therefore, since we will consider once for all \nthe point O as a fixed one, only on the coordinates of the point P, or, expressed \ndifferently, it is a function of these coordinates. From analogy with corresponding \nconsiderations in the case of fields of force, this line integral is called the “veloc\xad\nity potential,” and the particular kind of motion in which such a potential exists \nis called a “potential motion.” As follows immediately from the meaning of line \nintegrals, the component of the velocity in a definite direction is the derivative of \nthe potential in this direction. If the line-element is perpendicular to the resul\xad\ntant velocity, the increase of the potential equals zero, i.e., the surfaces of constant \npotential are everywhere normal to the velocity of flow. The velocity itself is called \nthe gradient of the potential. The velocity components u, v, w are connected with \nthe potential Φ by the following equations:\n\t\nu = ∂ϕ\n∂x,\u2003 v = ∂ϕ\n∂y ,\u2003 w = ∂ϕ\n∂z,\t\n(3)\nThe fact that the flow takes place without any change in volume is expressed \nby stating that as much flows out of every element of volume as flows in. This leads \nto the equationFigure 2: Production of circulation by introduction and withdrawal of flat plate\nFIGURE 2.

All functions Φ (x, y, z, t), \nwhich satisfy this last equation, represent possible forms of flow. This representa\xad\ntion of a flow is specially convenient for calculations, since by it the entire flow is \ngiven by means of the one function Φ. The most valuable property of the repre\xad\nsentations is, though, that the sum of two, or of as many as one desires, functions \nΦ, each of which satisfies equation (4a), also satisfies this equation and therefore \nrepresents a possible type of flow (“superposition of flows”).\n6. Another concept can be derived from the circulation, which is convenient \nfor many considerations, viz, that of rotation. The component of the rotation with \nreference to any axis is obtained if the circulation is taken around an elementary \nsurface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Expressed more exactly, \nsuch a rotation component is the ratio of the circulation around the edge of any \nsuch infinitesimal surface to the area of the surface. The total rotation is a vector \nand is obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular \naxes. In the case that the fluid rotates like a rigid body, the rotation thus defined \ncomes out as twice the angular velocity of the rigid body. If we take a rectangular \nsystem of axes and consider the rotations with reference to the separate axes, we \nfind that the rotation can also be expressed as the geometrical sum of the angular \nvelocities with reference to the three axes.\nThe statement that in the case of a potential motion the circulation is zero for \nevery closed fluid line can now be expressed by saying the rotation in it is always \nzero. The theorem that the circulation, if it is zero, remains zero under the conditions \nmentioned, can also now be expressed by saying that, if these conditions are satis\xad\nfied in a fluid in which there is no rotation, rotation can never arise. An irrotational \nfluid \nmotion, \ntherefore, \nalways remains irrotational. \nIn this, however, the fol\xad\nlowing exceptions are to be \nnoted: If the fluid is divided \nowing to bodies being pres\xad\nent in it, the theorem under \nconsideration does not apply \nto the fluid layer in which \nthe divided flow reunites, \nnot only in the case of fig\xad\nure 2 but also in the case of Figure 3: Successive positions of a fluid line of flow around a solid body showing flow around a airfoil\nFIGURE 3. Successive positions of a fluid line in flow around a \nsolid\xa0body.']","

Vortex filaments are a concept in fluid dynamics that refer to the particles of a fluid which at any one time have formed the boundary of a vortex tube. The circulation theorem states that the circulation, or the strength of the vortex tube, has the same value at all times. This means that if a portion of the filament is stretched, the rotation is doubled, and the vector expressing the rotation is changed in magnitude and direction exactly as the distance between two neighboring particles on the axis of the filament is changed. The circulation theorem also states that the circulation around any closed line is equal to the algebraic sum of the vortex strengths of all the filaments which cross a surface having the closed line as its boundary. This is important because it allows for the calculation of the velocity at any point in the space based on the distribution of the rotation. The formula for this calculation is given by equation (6) in the context, which states that the amount of the velocity due to a vortex element is proportional to the strength of the vortex, the element of its medial line, and the sine of the angle between the element and the distance from the vortex element to the point where the velocity is to be calculated. The total velocity at the point is obtained by adding the contributions of all the vortex elements present in the space."
What is the significance of aerogel in the Stardust mission and what are its unique properties?,"Aerogel is a unique material used in the Stardust mission to capture interstellar dust and cometary particles. It is a substance that is 99% empty space, with a density of less than 1% of that of typical glass. Its properties include being extremely low-density silicon glass that is only a little bit denser than air. Aerogel was not invented for Stardust, but the mission's use of aerogel was a significant technological advancement. The first scientific papers announcing the substance were published in 1931 and 1932 by Samuel Kistler, an instructor at the College of the Pacific. The Stardust team drew on the rich heritage of cometary encounter and sample return mission concepts as they attempted a straightforward mission concept—“bring the comet home”—for a bargain-basement price. The team agreed on a singular primary science objective: collect 1,000 cometary particles greater than or equal to 15 microns in diameter and return them to Earth for laboratory analysis, with image collection and the capture of interstellar grains as secondary objectives. With these modifications and with so many years and so many studies of mission concepts, Stardust was selected by the Discovery Program on its first try.","['NASA′s Discovery Program\n70\nScience Programs Directorate; Noel Hinners, the vice president of flight systems at \nLockheed Martin Space Systems; and the NASA Discovery Project Manager.

En route to Wild\xa02 and on \nthe return, a sample collector would open to collect interstellar grains. An optional \nflyby of the asteroid Annefrank would allow testing of the in situ instrument payload \nand the encounter software. Shortly before the spacecraft flew past Wild\xa02, the aerogel \ncollectors would open to collect particles of ancient cometary dust at a crawling rela\xad\ntive speed of just 6.1 kilometers per second. The collectors would then close, and the \nspacecraft would continue its two-year journey back to Earth.\nAerogel—Stardust’s “secret weapon”—is extremely low-density silicon glass that \nis 99 percent empty space, with a density of less than 1 percent of that of typical glass. \nSome members of the team called it “frozen smoke.” According to Brownlee, the PI, \n“Aerogel is only a little bit denser than air.

The first scientific papers \nannouncing the substance were published in 1931 and 1932 by Samuel Kistler, an \ninstructor at the College of the Pacific. Having just begun his doctoral work in the \nsummer of 1927, Kistler spent the academic year teaching undergraduate courses. He \nlearned to work with wet gels from a professor there, J. W. McBain, and, with assistance \nfrom undergraduate Charles H. Learned, employed supercritical fluid drying to create \nthe first aerogel.91 This new material was a silica aerogel: a substance that captured \nimaginations with its wispy appearance, extremely low density, and incredible strength. \n88 \t\nNiebur, S.

The process is called supercritical fluid drying.92\nAerogel was used for different coating and detector experiments in the years before \nStardust. “There were several physics departments around the world that were actually \nmaking aerogel for these Cherenkov counters,” said Brownlee, “so the word of aerogel \nand its properties was sort of floating around the physics community at some level.”93 \nTsou first encountered the material on a visit to Los Alamos, where he saw a small \npiece on a windowsill and was intrigued with its properties. In the mid- to late 1990s, \nBrownlee and Tsou came up with ways to fly aerogel in space on the Shuttle. Larger \ntests, using space station–attached payloads and European missions, soon “indicated \nyou could collect particles at this kind of speed and have them survive intact. And \nthat’s really the technology that made Stardust possible, finding low-density capsule \nmaterials,” said Brownlee.94\nAerogel proved the enabling technology for cometary sample return on this mis\xad\nsion; over 1,000 particles larger than 15 microns were expected in the 1,000 square \ncentimeters of ultra-fine mesostructure silica aerogel. Laboratory tests led the scientists \nto expect, among other things, hydrated silicates, noble gases, and organic material \nto be retained during the material’s approximate 6-kilometer-per-second encounter \nwith the comet.95\nThe spacecraft was based on the Lockheed Martin SpaceProbe deep space bus, \nbuilt with flat panels made of thin sheets of graphite over a lightweight aluminum \n“honeycomb” core.

In the years following the earlier, rejected proposals, four major new tech\xad\nnological advances had been made across industry and academia that would enable a \nrealistic mission that included both interstellar and cometary sample return paradigms: \nnamely, the development of an intact particle capture technology called aerogel; a \nlow-energy sample return trajectory that could match a comet’s velocity to just over \n6 kilometers per second using minimal fuel for velocity changes (thereby enabling \nthe use of a smaller spacecraft that could be launched by a Discovery-friendly Boeing \nDelta II rocket); the identification of micron-sized interstellar grains currently enter\xad\ning the solar system with the neutral interstellar helium gas (as seen by dust detectors \non Ulysses and Galileo); and dramatic improvements in analytical instrumentation \nfor determining the isotopic, mineralogical, elemental, and chemical compositions of \nmicron-sized grains or their components.48\nWhile development on the nascent mission concept called Stardust had been targeted \nto return fresh interstellar grains, the plan was modified in 1994 to study and return \nboth “fresh” interstellar grains recently injected into the interstellar medium and ancient \ninterstellar grains and nebular condensates frozen in comets.

Aerogel is significant in the Stardust mission as it is the material used for collecting interstellar grains and ancient cometary dust. It is referred to as the mission's ""secret weapon"" due to its unique properties. Aerogel is an extremely low-density silicon glass that is 99 percent empty space, with a density of less than 1 percent of that of typical glass. It is so light that it is often compared to frozen smoke. Despite its low density, aerogel is incredibly strong, making it an ideal material for collecting and preserving delicate particles in space.

"How have measurements in microgravity contributed to understanding the solidification of metals and the Soret effect in colloids, and what are the potential implications for materials science and oil reservoirs? Additionally, how have recent combustion studies on the space station impacted our understanding of low and intermediate temperature fuel chemistry and fire safety in microgravity?","Measurements in microgravity have contributed significantly to understanding the solidification of metals and the Soret effect in colloids. In studies of crystallization of metallic alloys, different growth patterns and evolution of microstructures have helped us to better understand the physical principles that govern solidification. These structures play a critical role in the physical properties and behavior of metallic products, and data from ISS solidification of metal alloys have contributed to models that better predict the position of columnar-to-equiaxed transition of metal alloys during the solidification process.

In recent combustion studies on the space station, cool flames were observed unexpectedly following the radiative extinction of burning fuel droplets. This result was not predicted by computational models based on high-temperature chemistry nor expected, and has opened up new areas of combustion research in space. Results such as these can lead to a better understanding of both low and intermediate temperature fuel chemistry and effects on droplet combustion, with implications for spray combustion and fire safety.

In ISS studies of colloids, effects of temperature change on the movement of molecules in fluids and gases constantly moving and colliding have been measured in the absence of gravity, and thus convection. One particular investigation went to space to measure mixtures of tetrahydronapthtalene (THN), isobutylbenzene (IBB) and n-dodecane (nC12). Researchers measured the separation of these chemicals, and calculated the numbers for the Soret effect for these chemicals. Because the Soret effect occurs in underground oil reservoirs on Earth, the results will help us better understand the behaviors of similar components in these reservoirs.

Overall, the unique microgravity environment of the ISS provides a laboratory environment found nowhere else, allowing us to study long-term physical effects in the absence of gravity, without the complications of gravity-related processes such as convection and sedimentation. This has significant implications for materials science and oil reservoirs, as well as for combustion research in space.","['48\nenvironment allows different physical properties to \ndominate systems, and these have been harnessed for \na wide variety of investigations in the physical sciences.\nResults from space station fluids \ninvestigations have allowed \ninvestigators to compile a video \ndatabase of capillary and fluid \nflows in microgravity.\nInvention of modern materials for different applications \nis based on complex fundamental studies.

Measurements in microgravity have contributed to understanding the solidification of metals by revealing that when melted metals are cooled down in extremely low temperatures and kept away from surfaces, such as inside the electromagnetic levitator, the dendrites of crystals grow very fast. A higher concentration of the element in the metal leads to different dendrite growth characteristics. These results suggest that measurements in microgravity are important in understanding how solidification of metals take place. In studies of crystallization of metallic alloys, different growth patterns and evolution of microstructures have helped us to better understand the physical principles that govern solidification. These structures play a critical role in the physical properties and behavior of metallic products, and data from ISS solidification of metal alloys have contributed to models that better predict position of columnar-to-equiaxed transition of metal alloys during the solidification process.

In colloids, measurements in microgravity have been used to measure the Soret effect, which is the separation of chemicals in fluids and gases due to temperature change, in the absence of gravity, and thus convection. This has helped researchers better understand the behaviors of similar components in underground oil reservoirs on Earth.

Recent combustion studies on the space station have impacted our understanding of low and intermediate temperature fuel chemistry and fire safety in microgravity. Cool flames were observed unexpectedly following the radiative extinction of burning fuel droplets, which was not predicted by computational models and has opened up new areas of combustion research in space. Results such as these can lead to a better understanding of both low and intermediate temperature fuel chemistry and effects on droplet combustion, with implications for spray combustion and fire safety. Studies of burning solid materials have shown that when the opposed flow velocity is increased, the flame spread rate first increases, and then decreases. This was predicted theoretically but had never before been observed experimentally. Data such as these suggest that microgravity could pose a higher fire risk and a more difficult fire suppression, which would have significant implications for spacecraft fire safety."
"Question: What is the purpose of the follow-on study, Cardiac and Vessel Structure and Function with Long-Duration Space Flight and Recovery (Vascular Echo)?","The purpose of the follow-on study, Cardiac and Vessel Structure and Function with Long-Duration Space Flight and Recovery (Vascular Echo), is to investigate the changes in arteries and the heart during spaceflight and upon return to Earth.

The study uses ultrasound and blood samples to provide immediate feedback on the development of arterial stiffness and cardiac changes during spaceflight and following return to Earth. This study is significant because it can help develop effective countermeasures to maintain the health of space travelers and reduce the detrimental effect of aging on Earth.

It explores a potential measure to \nreduce the excess amount of blood in the upper body \nby using a leg cuff, and less-complicated ways than \nultrasound to measure changes in arterial stiffness.\nFinally, a fourth study—The space environment causes \nacceleration of vascular aging: roles of hypogravity, \nnutrition and radiation (Vascular Aging)—will try to \nconfirm if and when insulin resistance, a precursor \nof type 2 diabetes, develops during a space mission, \nclarify the effect of radiation exposure and track the \nrecovery process after return on cardiovascular health.\nCardiovascular disease is the number one cause \nof death on Earth, where research has associated \nphysical inactivity with the development of risk factors, \nincluding arterial stiffness and insulin resistance. \nThese spaceflight studies provide a platform to explore \npotential mechanisms and help develop interventions \nto slow vascular aging and improve health and quality \nof life for everyone—regardless of whether their hearts \nare free of gravity. \nDressing Astronauts for Return to Earth\nAstronauts on the ISS perform research with mice \nand spiders, and not a single crew member ever faints. \nWhen those same astronauts come back to Earth, \nthough, it can be a different story. \nPostflight orthostatic intolerance, or the inability to \nmaintain blood pressure while in an upright position, \ncan cause astronauts to faint upon return from space. \nBetween 60% and 80% of astronauts experience \northostatic intolerance after long-duration missions. \nThis represents a potential hazard for crew members \nduring re-entry and after landing, especially \nshould there be a need for an emergency exit \nfrom the spacecraft.\nCountermeasures such as fluid loading and \ncompression garments have demonstrated some \neffectiveness in preventing this phenomenon. \nHowever, neither is completely effective at all phases \nof landing and egress. Therefore, research continues.\nNASA and ROSCOSMOS have used garments that \nprovide lower-body compression as a countermeasure \nto protect astronauts and cosmonauts during and after \nreturn from spaceflight.\nNASA continues to improve \ncompression garments that allow \nastronauts to dress for a more \nsuccessful return to Earth. \nA next-generation compression garment design \nresulted from a series of studies conducted by NASA’s', '165\nHeart Health and Biorhythms\nStudying spaceflight effects on the cardiovascular system has led to the creation of unique \ninstruments that can be used on Earth for the detection of the earliest deviations in health status. \nThese technologies are now used to examine motor vehicle drivers and civil aviation pilots to evaluate \nrisks and prevent accidents. Twenty-four-hour electrocardiograms of astronauts were also analyzed to \nunderstand the space environment’s effect on biological rhythm and cardiac autonomic nervous activity, \nwhich led to recommendations for maintaining a well-balanced biological rhythm on Earth. One of \nthese recommendations is maintenance of a regular sleep schedule. To study the sleep patterns of \ncosmonauts, information is recorded via a miniature device that fits in their pocket, and the data are \nsent to Earth for analysis of sleep quality. An Earth model of this device is placed under the pillow or \nmattress to record movements related to heart and breathing.\nSpace Cardiology for the \nBenefit of Health Care\nThe cardiovascular system plays an exceptionally \nimportant role in cosmonauts’ physical adaptation \nto long-term weightlessness. The scientific experiment \nPuls (2002 to the present) and the experiment \nPneumocard (2007 through 2012) were performed \nregularly on the International Space Station (ISS) to \nstudy spaceflight effects on the cardiovascular system. \nExperiment Cardiovector is a logical continuation \nof the experiments Puls and Pneumocard, which \ngives the opportunity to assess cardiac function and \nautonomic cardiovascular and respiratory control using \neasy, cheap, reliable and non-invasive techniques for \ncardiovascular monitoring. This scientific experiment \ninvolved the whole Russian space station crew on \nthe ISS and was performed regularly since 2014. \nThese studies have provided a tremendous amount \nof information about space cardiology that has resulted \n\nin new technologies being successfully used to \nevaluate the body’s functional reserves, to determine \nthe degree of stress on regulatory systems, and to \nassess the risk of development of disease. These \nnew technologies served as the basis both for further \ndevelopment of cardiological systems on the ISS \nand for the creation of unique sets of instruments \nthat can be used in health care practice. On Earth, \nthe hardware-software complex Ecosan-2007 is a \nmultipurpose instrument for early detection of the \nearliest deviations in health status. Ecosan-2007 is \nbased on the principle of prenosological diagnosis, \nThese studies have provided a \ntremendous amount of information \nabout space cardiology that has \nresulted in new technologies being \nsuccessfully used to evaluate \nthe body’s functional reserves, to \ndetermine the degree of stress on \nregulatory systems, and to assess \nthe risk of development of disease.

The root cause for the \ndecrease is under investigation; however, studies \nsuggest that the one-carbon metabolic pathway \nand the fluid shifts to the head that lead to increased \nintracranial pressure during spaceflight may play \nsignificant roles (Alperin et al., 2018; Mader et al., 2013; \nMader et al., 2016; Zwart et al., 2012). A retrospective \nanalysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of \nISS astronauts showed an upward brain shift with \ntissue crowding at the upper part of the brain, which \ncaused elevated intracranial pressure and optic nerve \nswelling. However, the implications of these changes \non spaceflight-induced ocular syndrome was not clear \nbecause most long-duration crew members had the \nbrain changes but only a few had vision problems \n(Roberts et al., 2017). Additional studies show that', '44\nin physical fitness and an increase in sensorimotor \nimpairment. These results raise new questions about \nthe role of artificial gravity countermeasures to maintain \nhuman health during long-duration exploration-class \nmissions. (Shiba et al., 2017). Studies have also shown \nthat spaceflight activates lipotoxic pathways (i.e., \nan accumulation of lipid products in cells) in mouse \nliver, initiates a loss of retinol, and creates a possible \nincreased risk of fatty liver disease, thereby opening \nnew research questions surrounding liver metabolism \nand function (Jonscher et al., 2016). \nIn a long-term mouse mission of 91 days, results \nsuggest that the force-producing extensor digitorum \nlongus (EDL) muscle may resist microgravity-induced \natrophy by activating certain inherent compensatory \nand protective pathways (Cancedda et al., 2012). \nThese studies also show an increased sensitivity of \nthe “antigravity” soleus muscle—the muscle responsible \nfor walking and standing activities—adding insight \ninto the mechanisms for resistance of EDL that could \ncontribute to the development of countermeasures \nto muscle loss in space (Sandonà et al., 2012). \nMoreover, analysis of specific bone formation and \nresorption marker expression in these mice suggested \nthat the microgravity-induced bone loss was due to \nboth an increased bone resorption and a decreased \nbone deposition. More specifically, the protection \nobserved in transgenic mice overexpressing the PTN \n(pleiotrophin) protein was likely due to higher osteoblast \nactivity, which aids in bone formation (Tavella et al., \n2012). In mouse cardiovascular studies, mice flown \nto the space station for 8 days showed a decreased \nexpression of calcium channels, which regulate the \ncontractibility of smooth muscle cells in portal veins \nthat carry blood to the liver. A similar effect was \nobserved in rat liver portal vein myocytes cultured on \nthe space station for 8 days, as well as in rats during \nhind-limb suspension on Earth (Dabertrand et al., 2011). \nHuman Studies\nISS research has revealed astonishing similarities \nbetween spaceflight and the aging process through the \nstudy of astronauts’ heart and blood vessels. Constant \nelevation in blood pressure in the brain while in space, \nreduced physical activity, and the constant exposure \nto higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) might impair \nthe ability of blood vessels of the brain to respond to \nchanges in arterial blood pressure and CO2. This was \naccompanied by insulin resistance in some astronauts \nduring spaceflight—an issue that is also observed in \nthe elderly. Walls of the carotid and femoral arteries \nwere found to be significantly thicker (12%) in all \nastronauts after spaceflight. Increase in artery stiffness \nand thickness after 6 months on the space station \ncorresponded with 10 to 20 years of normal aging \nbut was reversed within a few days of return. The same \npattern was seen in isolation studies (e.g., the Mars \n500 study), indicating this may be a stress response \nto confinement rather than an effect of microgravity \n(Arbeille et al., 2016; Hughson et al., 2016). One study \ndemonstrated that an improved rebreathing method \nwas a more accurate tool to properly monitor cardiac \nfunction during spaceflight than measuring blood \npressure at fingertips (Hughson et al., 2017). Further \nevidence from this study also showed that the elevated \nCO2 exposure could be linked to the vision impairment \nintracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome (Hughson et al., \n2017). Studies of astronauts’ core body temperature \nin microgravity during periods of exercise and rest \nhave shown an increase of 1°C, which is significant \nenough to impair physical and cognitive performance \nif not addressed for long-duration exploration missions \nbeyond LEO (Stahn et al., 2017).\nISS crew members report a variety of neurological \nsymptoms that may be related to changes in cerebral \nvenous outflow. Studies on blood flow changes using \nplethysmography confirm that long-duration spaceflights \nlead to a redistribution of venous blood volume and \nshow interesting differences in the amplitude of cardiac \noscillations measured at the level of the neck veins.', '166\nwhich arose in space medicine. Prenosological refers \nto the study of changes in the body that precede their \ndevelopment. This device is now used to examine \nmotor vehicle drivers, civil aviation pilots, and test \nsubjects in experiments on Earth involving various \nstress factors.\nA study that used the Ecosan-2007 to detect early \nhealth issues among 105 bus drivers showed that \nmore than 30% of the drivers were in prenosological \nand premorbid states, which sharply increases the \nrisk of motor vehicle accidents. During examinations \nof civil aviation pilots, the use of Ecosan-2007 showed \nthat long-term, work-related chronic stress increases \nthe risk development of pathologies, which should be \nconsidered during the expert evaluation of fitness for \nflight, especially for people over the age of 50.\nThe Ecosan-2007 complex was also used in a 520-day \nexperiment on Earth that simulated a flight to Mars. \nMonthly examinations of the “Martian” crew located in \na pressurized mock-up of an interplanetary spacecraft \nand, at the same time, of volunteer test subjects in \ncontrol groups in 12 different regions of the world \nwere performed. Long-term telemedicine of medical-\nenvironmental research using the Ecosan-2007 \ncomplex will be the prototype of a future system \nof individual prenosological monitoring, which will \nbe based on space cardiology methods.\nThe results of the studies performed on Earth using the \nEcosan-2007 complex served as a tool for Earth-based \nclinical use and as the basis for the further development \nof space cardiology technologies. The space device \nCosmocard is developing the methodology that \nwas used in the Ecosan-2007 for electrocardiogram \ndispersion mapping and can be used for the non-\ninvasive study of the energy-metabolic characteristics \nof the cardiac muscle. This method is actively used in \nclinic for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. \nWe hope that two new experiments—Cardiovector and \nCosmocard—that have been developed for the ISS will \nallow us to answer questions about spatial distribution \nof cardiac contraction energy in microgravity, ratio of \nthe right and left part of the heart, and relationship \nbetween the hemodynamic and energy features of the \nheart in different periods of a long-term space mission.\nExperiment Cardiovector aboard the ISS.\nImage credit: ROSCOSMOS\nVascular Studies in Space: \nGood for Everyone’s Heart \nPerhaps the human heart does not really yearn to \nbe free—at least not from gravity. Microgravity affects \nthe heart’s ability to pump blood and provide oxygen \nto cells throughout the body, which can have serious \nhealth consequences, especially upon landing on \na planet. The heart adapts to changes in blood \ndistribution and pressure in weightlessness, which can \ncause dizziness or fainting upon return to the ground. \nFour Canadian experiments, funded by CSA and led \nby Dr. Richard Hughson of the University of Waterloo, \nhave looked into why this happens in order to develop \neffective countermeasures, help maintain the health \nof space travelers and reduce the detrimental effect \nof aging on Earth. \nThese spaceflight studies provide \na platform to explore potential \nmechanisms and help develop \ninterventions to slow vascular aging \nand improve health and quality of life \nfor everyone—regardless of whether \ntheir hearts are free of gravity. \nThe first experiment, Cardiovascular and Cerebro-\nvascular Control on Return from the International Space \nStation (CCISS), found that important differences exist \namong individuals. The cardiovascular system ensures \ncontinuous supply of oxygenated blood to the brain']","
The purpose of the follow-on study, Cardiac and Vessel Structure and Function with Long-Duration Space Flight and Recovery (Vascular Echo), is to examine changes in blood vessels and the heart while in space and following return to Earth. This study will determine how arteries and the heart react to changes in blood pressure, whether blood flow after exercise is changed by spaceflight, and identify warning signs of arterial stiffening in the blood. This study uses ultrasound and blood samples to provide immediate feedback on the development of arterial stiffness and cardiac changes during spaceflight. It explores a potential measure to reduce the excess amount of blood in the upper body by using a leg cuff, and less-complicated ways than ultrasound to measure changes in arterial stiffness."
"What was the intended mission of the 1963 Soviet Lunar Probe, and what was the outcome of the mission?","The intended mission of the 1963 Soviet Lunar Probe (Ye-6 no. 2) was a lunar soft-landing. However, the outcome of the mission was a failure to escape Earth orbit due to a failure in a current converter in the power system of the I-100 instrument container (which controlled both the Blok L and the spacecraft), which as a result, failed to issue a command to fire the Blok L engine. The spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, unacknowledged by the Soviets until 11 January 1963.

In contrast, the 1971 Soviet Luna 18 mission aimed to recover soil samples from the lunar surface. After two mid-course corrections, Luna 18 entered a circular orbit around the Moon on 7 September 1971 at 100 kilometers altitude with an inclination of 35°. However, due to an off-nominal orbit and a failure in one of the orientation engines, the spacecraft was unable to conduct a successful landing. Contact with the spacecraft was abruptly lost at 07:47:16.5 UT at the previously determined point of lunar landing.

The 1972 Soviet Luna 19 mission aimed to enter orbit around the Moon and conduct a high-resolution imaging mission. However, a failure in a gyro-platform in the orientation system pointed the vehicle incorrectly and Luna 19 ended up in a much higher orbit than planned. As a result, the original high-resolution imaging mission as well as use of the radio altimeter was canceled.

In summary, while the 1963 Soviet Lunar Probe failed to escape Earth orbit, the 1971 and 1972 Soviet Luna missions aimed to conduct lunar missions but encountered technical difficulties that prevented successful outcomes.","['33\n1963\n36\n[Luna, \nY\ne-6 no. 2]\nNation: USSR (20)\nObjective(s): lunar soft-landing\nSpacecraft: Ye-6 (no. 2)\nSpacecraft Mass: 1,420 kg\nMission Design and Management: OKB-1\nLaunch Vehicle: Molniya + Blok L (8K78 no. \nT103-09)\nLaunch Date and Time: 4 January 1963 / 08:48:58 UT\nLaunch Site: NIIP-5 / Site 1/5\nScientific Instruments:\n1.\t imaging system\n2.\t gas-discharge counter\nResults: This spacecraft was the first “second gener\xad\nation” Soviet lunar probe (known as Ye-6), designed \nto accomplish a survivable landing on the surface \nof the Moon.

Luna 10 conducted \nextensive research in lunar orbit, gathering import\xad\nant data on the weakness of the Moon’s magnetic \nfield, radiation belts, and micrometeoroid density. \nIn 2012, a Soviet scientist made the claim that Luna \n10’s achievements included “the first gamma-ray \nspectrometer used in the history of space research \nto first define the contents of natural radio nuclides \nin the lunar soil.” Data from Luna\xa0 10 suggested \nthat Moon rocks were comparable to terrestrial \nbasalt rocks. Based on data collected by the probe, \nEfraim Akim (1929–2010) at the USSR Academy \nof Sciences identified the “noncentrality of the \ngravitational field of the Moon” which he argued \nwas “the essential fact determining the evolution of \nthe orbit of Luna 10,” as reported in an Academy \njournal in 1966.

The intended mission of the 1963 Soviet Lunar Probe was to verify key technological systems during a simpler mission into deep space and back to Earth. The spacecraft, named ""Object-Probes"" (ob'yekt-zond), was designed to depart from Earth's ecliptic out to 12-16 million kilometers from Earth and then return back to Earth after about six months when its orbit intersected with that of Earth again. The spacecraft was aided by two mid-course corrections using its S5.45 main engine.

However, the outcome of the mission was not successful. During the mission, the third and fourth stages separated abnormally, and after reaching Earth orbit, ground control lost telemetry from the Blok L upper stage designed to send the vehicle past the Moon. As a result, the spacecraft remained stranded in Earth orbit. The stage's main engine turbopump probably exploded upon ignition, destroying the spacecraft. With this mission, the Soviets began the practice of giving ""Kosmos"" designations to obscure the failure of lunar and planetary probes that remained stranded in Earth orbit. If the spacecraft had successfully departed from Earth orbit, it would probably have been called ""Zond 1."""
What was the impact of the Soviet Union's collapse on the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) in the United States?,"The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had a significant impact on the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) in the United States. The SEI, which aimed to send humans to the Moon and Mars, was working its way through the political process at the same time that the Soviet Union was collapsing. The new Russian Federation, as the Soviet Union’s core state was renamed, did not even retain control of the USSR’s old launch facilities, which were in the newly independent state of Kazakhstan. In this atmosphere, the House Appropriations Committee chose to remove all SEI-related funds from NASA’s fiscal year 1991 budget while still allowing an increase in the Agency’s overall budget. It specifically deleted funding for a Lunar Observer mission and new human missions and launch vehicles.

This decision was part of a larger political crisis in 1993 when, in a continuing debate over appropriations, the Superconducting Super Collider and space station projects were subjected to up-or-down votes. The space station survived by one vote in the House of Representatives, while the Collider was shut down. The result of these conflicts was that the space station and Space Shuttle programs were reorganized in an attempt to reduce costs. Space Station Alpha, renamed Space Station Freedom in the last years of the Reagan administration, was yet again redesigned and was recast as a component of U.S. foreign policy. The Clinton administration–era redesign, eventually renamed the International Space Station (ISS), was smaller and included the Russian Federation as a partner for several reasons. Russian space technology was first-class and cheap, and it provided jobs for Russian engineers and scientists who might otherwise be tempted to leave Russia, taking their knowledge of militarily significant space technology with them. NASA handed off the Space Shuttle Program to a Boeing–Lockheed Martin joint venture called the United Space Alliance, which would manage Shuttle operations.

In summary, the collapse of the Soviet Union had a damaging effect on the SEI, which was a quintessential Cold War–era giant space endeavor. The new political climate and budget constraints led to the removal of SEI-related funds from NASA's budget, and the space station and Space Shuttle programs were reorganized to reduce costs.

The \ncouncil also embarked on a public relations strategy aimed at discrediting \nthe report, knowing that the costs would leak out anyway.24 It was obvious \nthat Congress would not finance a program of this magnitude. Salvaging the \nMoon-Mars agenda—dubbed the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI)—meant \nfinding a way to make it cheaper—or at least make it appear cheaper. \nThe 90-Day Study was released in December 1989, as the President’s fis\xad\ncal year 1991 budget was being prepared for submission to Congress. In an \nearly sign of trouble, the White House Office of Management and Budget \nreduced NASA’s SEI-related request substantially, although it still allowed \nan increase in the Agency’s budget. In Congress, however, most agencies \nwere facing cuts, not increases, and NASA was no different. A White House \n“space summit” convened on 1 May 1990 failed to convince congressional \nleaders that the new initiative was worth funding. Two more damaging rev\xad\nelations in 1990—that the newly launched Hubble Space Telescope had a flaw \nin its primary mirror and that two of NASA’s four Space Shuttle orbiters had \ndeveloped dangerous hydrogen leaks—hurt the Agency’s technical credibil\xad\nity and political chances.25 \nIt did not help the administration’s case that the SEI, a quintessential \nCold War–era giant space endeavor, happened to be working its way through \nthe political process at the same time that the Soviet Union was collapsing. \nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had embarked on a series of political and \neconomic reforms in 1985 that had been intended to strengthen the nation’s \ndestitute economy, but they had the opposite effect. Political freedoms \nGorbachev introduced undermined the Communist Party and its hold on \nthe USSR as well as the USSR’s hold on the states of Eastern Europe. Cheering \ncrowds dismantled one of the Cold War’s greatest symbols, the Berlin Wall, \nin November 1989 before a shocked American television audience. East and \nWest Germany merged during 1990, and the Soviet Union itself dissolved in \nDecember 1991.

Hogan, Mars Wars, pp. 65, 75–81.', 'Chapter 5:\u2002 Becoming NASA\n67\nthe Soviet Union was “on the eve of the first artificial earth satellite” proved \nmore than boastful rhetoric.3 \nThe inner turmoil of the Sputnik crisis came in part because American efforts \nto launch a satellite, at least to be first, had failed. Some have suggested that \nthis represented “the shock of the century,” but that shock only slowly reverber\xad\nated through the American public in the days that followed. Most Americans \nseemed to recognize that the satellite did not pose a threat to the United States \nand congratulations were in order for the Soviet Union. \nInstead, most Americans embraced the dawn of the Space Age as a symbol \nof progress and a better future both on Earth and beyond. Raised on visions of \nhuman colonies on the Moon and Mars, great starships plying galactic oceans; \nand prospects of a bright, limitless future beyond a confining, overcrowded, \nand resource-depleted Earth brought to the public by the likes of media mag\xad\nnate Walt Disney and German rocketeer Wernher von Braun, a generation of \nAmericans embraced a promising future in space. Taught in the early 1950s \nthat spaceflight loomed just on the cusp of reality, they now saw that perception \ncome true. For one, it thrilled 14-year-old Homer Hickam as he watched “the \nbright little ball, moving majestically across the narrow star field between the \nridgelines” of his home in Coalwood, West Virginia. It inspired him, and many \nlike him, to devote their lives to the quest for space.4\nIn fact, the best evidence suggests that excitement about prospects for the \nfuture dominated the thinking of the American public immediately after the \nSputnik launch. Three days after its launch, social anthropologists Margaret \nMead and Rhoda Metraux began collecting data gauging American responses \nto Sputnik. They asked colleagues and friends around the country to conduct \nsurveys asking three open-ended questions among divergent age, gender, race, \neconomic, and social groups of all: \n1.\t What do you think about the satellite?\n2.\t How do you explain Russia’s getting their satellite up first?\n3.\t What do you think we can do to make up for it?\nMead and Metraux collected 2,991 adult responses until 18 October, and \nthese responses suggest the need for a revision to the master narrative since \nneither shock nor awe was present. An exceptionally small number said that \nthe Soviet launch of Sputnik was an unexpected event; an even smaller number \nregistered no knowledge of the launch. Of those who had little or no knowl\xad\nedge, the response of one 22-year-old white female from Austin, Texas, was \ncharacteristic: “It was a surprise to hear that the satellite was launched suc\xad\ncessfully…. I was skeptical that such a project would ever materialize. Now', '50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n20\nSpace, or Space 2.0. Most public attention here has focused on the human \nspaceflight program, with SpaceX ferrying supplies to the International \nSpace Station (ISS), and on potential space tourism. But some private groups \nhave also tried to get into the planetary game, from AMSAT (Radio Amateur \nSatellite Corporation) in the 1980s to Astrobotic Technology and other teams \ncompeting for the Google Lunar XPRIZE. \nThe variety of American space institutions leads us to consider which \nother countries have done solar system exploration and why. For much of the \nlast 50 years, it was mostly the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia, \njoined more recently by various European nations, Japan, China, and India. \nWe’ll return to some of these countries in a moment. Let us first note that \ninternational comparisons of, say, the types of people building space\xad\ncraft—their gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic class—might be illuminating. \nConsider the bureaucratic politics of the Soviet Union, with the Ministry \nof General Machine Building (MOM), the Space Research Institute of the \nRussian Academy of Sciences (IKI), and the various design bureaus, and \nhow these dynamics shaped the Soviet space program. Differences include \nrelations between civilian and military space programs. China, for example, \nhas less distinction between civilian and military space institutions—in part \nbecause it followed American suggestions in the late 1970s to embrace the \nU.S. model and integrate the two realms.4\nNations collaborated as well as competed in space, and space exploration \nhas provided fertile ground for diplomatic or international history.5 Looking \nabroad also raises interesting questions about colonialism—that is, colonial\xad\nism here on Earth, not space colonization. One might consider the Soviets \nlaunching spacecraft out of what is now Kazakhstan, or the French launch\xad\ning rockets out of French Guiana.6 Consider also the far-flung tracking sta\xad\ntions of the Deep Space Network, which confronted apartheid at its South \nAfrica site.

Justifications for space exploration have changed \nover time. In the 1990s, as the superpower standoff gave way to global com\xad\npetition in the high-tech economy, justifications shifted from maintaining \ninternational strategic standing to fueling the engines of economic growth. \nSolar system exploration, in this argument, supported the high-tech aero\xad\nspace industry, incubated new technologies, and, perhaps most important, \ninspired young Americans to careers in science and engineering. \nPerhaps to compensate for the mundane justification of economic com\xad\npetitiveness, the end of the Cold War also encouraged more transcendent \nmotives, in particular the possibility of finding life elsewhere in the cosmos. \nThe search for extraterrestrial life in a way turned solar system exploration \ninto a biology program, which meshed with wider scientific and economic \ninterests in biotechnology. Recall, however, all those American flags waving \naround JPL mission control during the 2012 Curiosity landing and the 2004 \nMars Exploration Rover landings. Space exploration as a vehicle for national \npride and patriotism was not just a Cold War phenomenon. \nAs to the motivation for other spacefaring countries: for the countries of \nEurope, it was perhaps less patriotism and more a way to foster European \nintegration, while balancing American scientific and technological hege\xad\nmony. In Europe, too, economic competitiveness was a motive—that is, \nspace missions were seen as a stimulus, or perhaps a subsidy, for high-tech \nindustry—and even stronger and earlier than in the United States. The same \nwas true for Japan. National pride remains a powerful factor, especially for \nnations experiencing that other key development of the 20th century, post\xad\ncolonialism. For a developing country like India, a space program symbol\xad\nizes status as a modern international power, much as nuclear weapons do. \n(And let us not forget that civil space programs remain a barely veiled signal \nof military space capability.) But in countries like India and China, where \nhundreds of millions of people struggle with desperate poverty despite pell-\nmell modernization, the basic question—is it worth it?—is more acute. How \ncan these countries justify spending a billion dollars on space? \nIn short, motivations for space exploration have reflected the broadest \nhistorical developments of this time: the Cold War, postcolonialism, global \neconomic development, and high-tech industry.\nThese developments explain why we’ve done it. The follow-on question is: \nwhat have we got for it?

Funding issues grew so serious that some analyses \npredicted that human spaceflight could consume NASA’s entire budget. In \n1991, this concern had led to an unprecedented public attack on the space sta\xad\ntion by 14 science associations such as the American Physical Society. Their \nobjections arose in response to budget caps negotiated between President \nGeorge H.\xa0W.

It especially infuriated conservative \nRepublicans, since Bush had famously told them, “Read my lips, no new \ntaxes,” at the 1988 Republican National Convention.25\nThe cost of NASA’s human spaceflight program precipitated a politi\xad\ncal crisis in 1993 when, in a continuing debate over appropriations, the \nSuperconducting Super Collider and space station projects were subjected \nto up-or-down votes.

The Soviet Union's collapse had a significant impact on the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) in the United States. The SEI, a large-scale space project, was being considered in Congress at the same time as the Soviet Union was undergoing major political and economic reforms. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent dissolution of the USSR in December 1991 led to a shift in priorities and a reduced appetite for large-scale space projects in the United States. As a result, the House Appropriations Committee removed all SEI-related funds from NASA's fiscal year 1991 budget, specifically deleting funding for a Lunar Observer mission and new human missions and launch vehicles.

The ultraviolet \nphotometer detected a hydrogen corona (as found \nby the Soviet Venera 4) but no oxygen emission. \nMariner V’s instruments indicated that the planet’s \nsurface temperature and pressure were 527°C and \n75 to 100 atmospheres, respectively—which coun\xad\ntered the Soviet claim that its Venera 4 spacecraft \nhad managed to transmit from the planet’s surface. \nThe encounter with Venus deflected the spacecraft \ntowards the Sun, and Mariner V entered solar orbit \nwith parameters ranging from 0.579 AU and 0.735 \nAU. On 4 December 1967, NASA lost contact with \nthe spacecraft although controllers briefly regained \ncontact on 14 October 1968. The spacecraft did \nnot transmit any further telemetry and NASA even\xad\ntually stopped attempts (on 5 November 1968) to \ncommunicate with the vehicle, now in heliocentric \norbit.

What is the problem with the helicopter industry?,"The problem with the helicopter industry is that it has failed to capitalize on the inherent advantages of the transport concept, which is the very reason individuals aspired and strived to produce a craft that could hover and fly vertically. A basic problem is the craft attempts to compete with the fixed-wing counterpart on the latter's terms. The lack of empirical learning and design integration in contemporary helicopters is evident, as the creature is a flying fatigue machine that resists being what the engineer insists it must be. Weight control is a greater requirement due to the hovering feature, and structural integrity is more demanding due to the vibration problems in the blades and slender shafting. The conflict in early machines between stability and controllability was more severe, and there was a misunderstanding of rotor design and behavior. The helicopter experimenters showed no sense of priorities, and the industry has failed to produce an effective control design. To address these issues, a new philosophy for an independent heliport system is needed, dedicated to intercity (including small city) transport and shuttle service.

The heliports are scaled-down, unique versions of airports created in uncongested areas, accessible by surface vehicles via new roads away from today's traffic flow.

The helicopter \nwith its simple and significant hover capability will always be part of this progress. \nThe question is, how many?\nThe introductions and narratives revealed two types of investigators termed \ninventive and scientific (or technical). The former described one who relies more \non intuition than formal technical discipline, in undertaking helicopter work. The \nlatter applies a trained, systematic approach to this activity. One can identify the \ncurrent counterparts of these advocates.\nExcept possibly for patents, the (helicopter) inventive type has disappeared \nfrom public notice. As mentioned before, in the 1950s there were numerous heli\xad\ncopter projects in the United States. (A repeat of fixed-wing builders after the First \nWorld War.) Many were independent, inventive individuals who worked with mod\xad\nels or prototypes. Their disappearance is attributed to the success of the helicopter \nitself, the complexity in defining current problems, the development costs, the lack \nof investor interest, and the idea the hovering problem was “solved”.\nToday these inventive individuals are replaced by amateur technicians (home \nor kit builders) interested in constructing their own helicopters of a proven design. \nThose who design the kits are innovators but work at a different level from those \nwho searched for the practical helicopter. Equally significant is the difference in \navailable knowledge, materials, and components.\nThe scientific counterpart is found mostly within the helicopter industry itself \n(often including academia). The maturing process leads to specialization. Now spe\xad\ncialists are the foundation of the industry. This specialization leads to projects led \nby a program or systems manager. One replaces the independent entrepreneur of \nearlier years, but they are not interchangeable.\nThe modern manager should have both the tenacity of the entrepreneur \n(“defending the design”) and a technical understanding of one’s subject. The earlier \nscientific type showed more interest in technology than management. The special\xad\nized approach depersonalizes the program. With large programs (or large compa\xad\nnies) visibility is lost, except for the few at the top level. The systems engineering \nconcept in the present sense does not create, for it deals with process or method\xad\nology. An organization will have a special creative staff, typically the “advanced \ndesign” group. Here is the place for today’s technical entrepreneur. Methodology \nitself as a discipline is an important characteristic of modern engineering, replacing \nthe “groping” of earlier years. Today in industry there are both “technical engi\xad\nneers” and “systems engineers.”\nThe startup technical entrepreneur in the helicopter field is scarce today, in \ncontrast to software applications designers, for example. As suggested above, the', '881\nDocument 5-54\nscarcity is due mainly to the costs involved and the lack of venture capital interest. \nA more subtle point concerns the fact a hovering rotor is a very simple, unsophis\xad\nticated device, once they got the parameters right. As a result there is little room \nfor a breakthrough in hovering systems, except in simplifying the helicopter itself. \nFurther, there is a limit to how fast a rotor can be flown edgewise through the air. \nFor these reasons the VTOL is the direction for major changes but at the sacrifice \nof hover capability.\nTechnology always had two branches, military and civil. In fact military engi\xad\nneering was one of the first technical professions. Except for the ephemeral, Civil \nWar activity and the DeBothezat helicopter project, the full span of the narra\xad\ntives reveal no military influence. Since the advent of the practical helicopter, the \nmilitary have been the driving force behind helicopter development. This branch \nof technology has lived up to all the expectations put on the military idea of the \nhelicopter, and in a relatively short time. From the historical viewpoint this is a \nremarkable achievement by the industry, yet one taken for granted.\nIn reflecting on the number of good ideas the early entrepreneurs advanced \nthat were ignored, one can appreciate the value of urgent military necessity in forc\xad\ning positive development. This notion is exemplified in the dramatic difference in \naircraft quality before and after two world wars, and in today’s progress in military \nhelicopters versus commercial ones.\nOne can conclude it is an aspect of human behavior passed down in history \nthat the absence of war is an opportunity cost to technology, not made up by the \n“commercial spirit”. Being “lean and mean” by definition creates nothing. It means \nwithdrawal and consolidation. The kind of technology described here requires \npatrons. Often with technology, the government is the biggest patron of all. In \nrecent times the military role has been in a state of flux as is its financial support of \nthe helicopter. The prospects are for integration of civil and military requirements \nand technology. International trends indicate a widening of the use of helicopters \nin matters of prominence in the 21st century: conservation, ecology, inspection and \npeacekeeping, these in addition to humanitarian missions. Oddly enough, the last \nis not free of hostile resistance.\nIn recent years the civil (commercial) branch benefited from the military devel\xad\nopments. The two, fundamental vehicles envisioned by the early rotary wing advo\xad\ncates have yet to be realized. These are the personal or private helicopter and the \nscheduled intercity or feeder helicopter. Success in both these areas would increase \nuse far beyond the present operations. Despite progress in the technology itself, the \nhelicopter today is a special purpose vehicle. Its strong suit waits to be played.\nIn the 1940s a well-known helicopter pioneer predicted in a decade or so, peo\xad\nple would be visiting each other in their private helicopters. Toward the end of \nWorld War II many articles were written on the privately owned helicopter to come \n(Figure 4.1) [not reproduced]. Now the concept is given little thought. In the light \nof today’s helicopters, the notion is fanciful. Aside from the vehicle design problem', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n874\non sound, interacting analytical and experimental methods. This view does not \nminimize scientific discovery but there is less possibility of this in helicopters today. \nToday, relatively more and varied intellectual energy can be brought to a prob\xad\nlem. The modem effort is based on extensive use of computers in analysis, design, \nand manufacturing, computers for example have made possible an entirely new \napproach to structural analysis: the finite element method. This method applies \nto such complex components as rotor blades and airframes as well as simple parts \n(e.g., critical bolts).\nIn sum, ideas can be ahead of their time because the environment for apprecia\xad\ntion or understanding is simply not there. The only “fault” here is using today’s \nknowledge to judge that of yesterday’s.\nIn view of the erratic technological way to the successful helicopter as discussed \nabove, one can reflect on the public and professional response to such an advanced \nidea as a flying machine in general, and the helicopter in particular.\nAs described before, this activity followed both inventive and scientific direc\xad\ntions. Remarkable to the helicopter itself was the prolonged duration in public view \nof the mostly unsuccessful efforts to make it practical. For an ultimately successful \nand unusual product as a flying machine, one may postulate five discrete stages to \nboth the public and professional response to the work of its adherents.\n1.\t On introducing the idea of human flight by mechanical means, the initial \nreaction is to see it as impossible. Only in mythology, fantasy, and religion \ndid humans have wings.\n2.\t In time, the dogmatic view softens as the notion develops a life of its own. \nDisputation involves broad philosophic principles and claims.\n3.\t In the third stage the concept is deemed impractical. Criticism is now on \nspecific technical or barrier problems that inhibit feasibility.\n4.\t The idea is taken seriously in the fourth stage. Technical problems are dis\xad\ncussed. There is tentative, and at times skeptical, acceptance.\n5.\t Finally there is general acceptance. Because the concept (the flying machine) \nhas been reduced to practice; an accomplished fact. Nothing makes things \nso obvious as a detailed explanation.\nNot every critic or adherent necessarily ran the full course. One could enter the \ndiscourse at any stage.\nFor helicopters and flying machines in general, the first three stages are identi\xad\nfied here with the 19th century. Recall the Scientific American criticism of 1848 \nand its attitude change in 1869. Other (French) criticism was described in the 19th \ncentury summary.\nThe fourth and fifth stages apply to the early 20th century. The success of \nthe Wrights in 1903 ultimately removed doubts about flying machines, but not \nimmediately, for there were skeptics. That consummate aeronautical engineer \nIgor Sikorsky witnessed those early years and recounts in a paper in 1971 initial', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n872\naeronautical “proof-of-concept” design, and could not be used for anything else, \nincluding repeated flying.\nThe Wrights’ contemporaries[,] though they accomplished “something”, failed \nto a major extent because they missed the point of leaving on the ground every \nthing and every idea but the essential ones for practical flight, and in not know\xad\ning there was only one crucial factor: adequate control of instability. The latter \nthey did not learn empirically, for few machines left the ground into free flight \nlong enough to deal with the problem. The Wrights’ sophisticated totality of the \npre-flying trade\xad\noffs and design integration along with minimization and focus are \nnot evident features when analyzing contemporary flying machines. This lack of \nevidence applies to the early helicopters as well.\nFor a helicopter, the problems are more demanding because it must hover. On \nthe ground or in the air, a helicopter is always alive. Of a modern helicopter as a \ndesign problem it is said the creature is a flying fatigue machine, one that resists \nbeing what the engineer insists it must be. This aphorism reflects an appreciation \nof the uncompromising problem prototype builders of the early 20th century were \nwilling to take on, despite the failures around them. A corollary aphorism: “nature \nis a jealous mistress.”\nWeight control even today is a greater requirement, again because of the hover\xad\ning feature. In prototypes, the light weight, self-cooling rotary engine was found \ngood-fortune [sic]. Hovering cooling became a development problem in the 1940–\n1945 period when the lighter, airplane piston engines were adapted to helicopters.\nSome of the early entrepreneurs chose the propeller-type rotor accepting weight \nfor strength, but at the same time settling for a reduced diameter, both associated \nwith higher power required. As described in the Glossary, selecting a larger rotor of \nwing construction reduced weight and power, but this choice introduced vibration \nproblems in the blades and slender shafting.\nHelicopter structural integrity was more demanding. Everything was vibrating \nwhether on the ground or briefly in the air. Structural fatigue, a fundamental con\xad\nsideration in all modern helicopters, was little understood in aircraft until the late \n1930s. Rotor blade fatigue, with the blades bending cyclically as they rotate, first \nappeared as a problem in the autogiro era. It was not until the late 1950s that ana\xad\nlytical techniques were developed to deal with blade fatigue and service life (flight \nhours before retirement) of blades. The object is to design blades with “infinite life”.\nRelative to fixed wings, the conflict in early machines between stability and \ncontrollability was more severe, and there was a misunderstanding of rotor design \nand behavior. None of the experimenters produced a control design that could \nbe considered effective, nor did they understand rotors except as a [sic] simple, \nbut perverse, lifting devices. The Wrights understood fixed wings before the first \npowered flight. Contrary to 19th century belief, they rejected the notion stability \nwas achieved by some pendulous mass below the machine.

What is the basic problem identified in the helicopter industry that prevents it from capitalizing on its inherent advantages and fulfilling its early vision?,"The basic problem identified in the helicopter industry that prevents it from capitalizing on its inherent advantages and fulfilling its early vision is the complexity and demanding requirements of designing and building a helicopter. The hovering feature, which is a significant advantage of helicopters, also presents unique challenges in terms of weight control, structural integrity, and rotor design. The lack of evidence for sophisticated design integration and minimization in contemporary flying machines is also a challenge, as it was not evident in the early helicopters either.

The helicopter \nwith its simple and significant hover capability will always be part of this progress. \nThe question is, how many?\nThe introductions and narratives revealed two types of investigators termed \ninventive and scientific (or technical). The former described one who relies more \non intuition than formal technical discipline, in undertaking helicopter work. The \nlatter applies a trained, systematic approach to this activity. One can identify the \ncurrent counterparts of these advocates.\nExcept possibly for patents, the (helicopter) inventive type has disappeared \nfrom public notice. As mentioned before, in the 1950s there were numerous heli\xad\ncopter projects in the United States. (A repeat of fixed-wing builders after the First \nWorld War.) Many were independent, inventive individuals who worked with mod\xad\nels or prototypes. Their disappearance is attributed to the success of the helicopter \nitself, the complexity in defining current problems, the development costs, the lack \nof investor interest, and the idea the hovering problem was “solved”.\nToday these inventive individuals are replaced by amateur technicians (home \nor kit builders) interested in constructing their own helicopters of a proven design. \nThose who design the kits are innovators but work at a different level from those \nwho searched for the practical helicopter. Equally significant is the difference in \navailable knowledge, materials, and components.\nThe scientific counterpart is found mostly within the helicopter industry itself \n(often including academia). The maturing process leads to specialization. Now spe\xad\ncialists are the foundation of the industry. This specialization leads to projects led \nby a program or systems manager. One replaces the independent entrepreneur of \nearlier years, but they are not interchangeable.\nThe modern manager should have both the tenacity of the entrepreneur \n(“defending the design”) and a technical understanding of one’s subject. The earlier \nscientific type showed more interest in technology than management. The special\xad\nized approach depersonalizes the program. With large programs (or large compa\xad\nnies) visibility is lost, except for the few at the top level. The systems engineering \nconcept in the present sense does not create, for it deals with process or method\xad\nology. An organization will have a special creative staff, typically the “advanced \ndesign” group. Here is the place for today’s technical entrepreneur. Methodology \nitself as a discipline is an important characteristic of modern engineering, replacing \nthe “groping” of earlier years. Today in industry there are both “technical engi\xad\nneers” and “systems engineers.”\nThe startup technical entrepreneur in the helicopter field is scarce today, in \ncontrast to software applications designers, for example.

Durand, Stanford University, 3 April 1920.\nThe idea of using a propeller rotating about a vertical shaft to give lift and \nto sustain a weight by balancing it directly with the thrust is almost as old as the \nscrew propeller itself, and the elements of the theory of the action of a lifting pro\xad\npeller have been understood for at least fifteen years. Unfortunately, however, the \nprinted discussions of this theory are almost all in French, German, or Italian, and \nthose which are available in English are mostly contained in advanced treatises \nwhich are not likely to fall into the hands of the casual student. A vast number of \nhelicopters have been invented, many have been built, and a very, very few have \nbeen successful up to the point of raising themselves from the ground. The possible \nadvantages of the helicopter are obvious, a machine which can rise and descend \nvertically, and which requires no large space over which to run before taking off \nand after descending, manifestly being more useful, other things being equal, than \nthe present type of airplane. It is regrettable that the inventors of direct-lift aircraft \nhave, in many instances, seen only these possible gains and have failed to consider \nfully the problem which they have to meet or to familiarize themselves with the \nfundamental theory on which the action of every helicopter must be based. It is \nfelt, therefore, that a broad survey of the problem will be of use in making clear the \nnature of some of the obstacles which have prevented any helicopter from reaching \nthe stage of practical usefulness as yet and may lead to a saving of some of the time \nand money which are constantly being squandered on attempts to demonstrate \nanew facts which are already perfectly well understood without in the least striking \nat the root of the problem.\nThe cruxes of the helicopter question are the securing of the necessary lift to \nrise from the ground, the assurance of a safe descent after complete failure of the \nengines, the securing of stability and controllability, and the maintenance of a rea\xad\nsonably high forward speed in the horizontal plane; and each of these points will \nbe discussed in turn. Manifestly, until the first problems are solved satisfactorily \nthe others do not rise at all, and the discussion will therefore be started with the \nquestion fundamental to all others, the question of the thrust which can be secured \nfrom a direct-lifting propeller and of the specifications to which the design of the \npropeller must conform in order that this thrust may be a maximum.\nTHE THEORY OF THE DIRECT-LIFTING SCREW PROPELLER.\nThe characteristics of propellers can be expressed in several different ways, but \nall of these except one involve the speed of advance, which is zero in the case of the', '703\nDocument 5-46 (a–b)\n1-2\u2002 HISTORY\nThe initial development of rotary-wing aircraft faced three major problems \nthat had to be overcome to achieve a successful vehicle. The first problem was to \nfind a light and reliable engine. The reciprocating internal combustion engine was \nthe first to fulfill the requirements, and much later the adoption of the turboshaft \nengine for the helicopter was a significant advance. The second problem was to \ndevelop a light and strong structure for the rotor, hub, and blades while maintain\xad\ning good aerodynamic efficiency. The final problem was to understand and develop \nmeans of controlling the helicopter, including balancing the rotor torque. These \nproblems were essentially the same as those that faced the development of the air\xad\nplane and were solved eventually by the Wright brothers. The development of the \nhelicopter in many ways paralleled that of the airplane. That helicopter develop\xad\nment took longer may be attributed to the cost of vertical flight, which required a \nhigher development of aeronautical technology before the problems could be satis\xad\nfactorily overcome.\nDocument 5-46 (b), Excerpts from Wayne Johnson, \nHelicopter Theory (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1980), \nchapter 7, “Design,” pp. 313–321.\n7-1\u2002 ROTOR TYPES\nThe helicopter rotor type is largely determined by the construction of the blade \nroot and its attachment to the hub. The blade root configuration has a fundamental \ninfluence on the blade flap and lag motion and hence on the helicopter handling \nqualities, vibration, loads, and aeroelastic stability. The basic distinction between \nrotor types is the presence or absence of flap and lag hinges, and thus whether the \nblade motion involves rigid body rotation or bending at the blade root.\nAn articulated rotor has its blades attached to the hub with both flap and lag \nhinges. The flap hinge is usually offset slightly from the center of rotation because \nof mechanical constraints and to improve the helicopter handling qualities. The lag \nhinge must be offset in order for the shaft to transmit torque to the rotor. The pur\xad\npose of the flap and lag hinges is to reduce the root blade loads (since the moments \nmust be zero at the hinge). With a lag hinge it is also necessary to have a mechani\xad\ncal lag damper to avoid a mechanical instability called ground resonance, involving \nthe coupled motion of the rotor lag and hub in-plane displacement. The articulated \nrotor is the classical design solution to the problem of the blade root loads and hub \nmoments. It is conceptually simple, and the analysis of the rigid body motion is \nstraightforward. The articulated rotor is mechanically complex, however, involving \nthree hinges (flap, lag, and feather) and a lag damper for each blade. The flap and \nlag bearings are required to transmit both the blade thrust and centrifugal force to', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n872\naeronautical “proof-of-concept” design, and could not be used for anything else, \nincluding repeated flying.\nThe Wrights’ contemporaries[,] though they accomplished “something”, failed \nto a major extent because they missed the point of leaving on the ground every \nthing and every idea but the essential ones for practical flight, and in not know\xad\ning there was only one crucial factor: adequate control of instability. The latter \nthey did not learn empirically, for few machines left the ground into free flight \nlong enough to deal with the problem. The Wrights’ sophisticated totality of the \npre-flying trade\xad\noffs and design integration along with minimization and focus are \nnot evident features when analyzing contemporary flying machines. This lack of \nevidence applies to the early helicopters as well.\nFor a helicopter, the problems are more demanding because it must hover. On \nthe ground or in the air, a helicopter is always alive. Of a modern helicopter as a \ndesign problem it is said the creature is a flying fatigue machine, one that resists \nbeing what the engineer insists it must be. This aphorism reflects an appreciation \nof the uncompromising problem prototype builders of the early 20th century were \nwilling to take on, despite the failures around them. A corollary aphorism: “nature \nis a jealous mistress.”\nWeight control even today is a greater requirement, again because of the hover\xad\ning feature. In prototypes, the light weight, self-cooling rotary engine was found \ngood-fortune [sic]. Hovering cooling became a development problem in the 1940–\n1945 period when the lighter, airplane piston engines were adapted to helicopters.\nSome of the early entrepreneurs chose the propeller-type rotor accepting weight \nfor strength, but at the same time settling for a reduced diameter, both associated \nwith higher power required. As described in the Glossary, selecting a larger rotor of \nwing construction reduced weight and power, but this choice introduced vibration \nproblems in the blades and slender shafting.\nHelicopter structural integrity was more demanding. Everything was vibrating \nwhether on the ground or briefly in the air. Structural fatigue, a fundamental con\xad\nsideration in all modern helicopters, was little understood in aircraft until the late \n1930s. Rotor blade fatigue, with the blades bending cyclically as they rotate, first \nappeared as a problem in the autogiro era. It was not until the late 1950s that ana\xad\nlytical techniques were developed to deal with blade fatigue and service life (flight \nhours before retirement) of blades. The object is to design blades with “infinite life”.\nRelative to fixed wings, the conflict in early machines between stability and \ncontrollability was more severe, and there was a misunderstanding of rotor design \nand behavior. None of the experimenters produced a control design that could \nbe considered effective, nor did they understand rotors except as a [sic] simple, \nbut perverse, lifting devices. The Wrights understood fixed wings before the first \npowered flight. Contrary to 19th century belief, they rejected the notion stability \nwas achieved by some pendulous mass below the machine. The helicopter exper\xad\nimenters showed no sense of priorities as did the Wrights, and bundled all the']","
The basic problem identified in the helicopter industry is that the craft attempts to compete with the fixed-wing counterpart on the latter’s terms. The helicopter tries to fit into the fixed-wing system that pervades the country. Instead, what is needed is a new philosophy for an independent heliport system, a national grid taking in the whole country, dedicated to intercity (including small city) transport and shuttle service. The heliports are scaled down, unique versions of airports created in uncongested areas, each paired to another city and assigned its own “catch region”. The vehicle should carry around 100 passengers, with noise attenuation and all-weather capability as major design requirements. The useful load is to include passengers, mail, and express goods."
What were the reasons behind the decision to reduce the number of flights in the X-34 program? Discuss the possible factors that may have contributed to this decision.,"The decision to reduce the number of flights in the X-34 program was made due to the limited test time available for the vehicle. The X-34 would have had very limited time on each flight to perform dedicated testing, as it would have had a low lift-to-drag ratio resulting in high rates of descent, and a high degree of power, which once extinguished could not be restarted. For unpowered flights, the vehicle would have had approximately 90 seconds of dedicated test time between drop time and the acquisition of the glide slope. For powered flights, the flight conditions would have changed so rapidly that the X-34 could neither fly at a constant Mach number or dynamic pressure during ascent or reentry. After separation from the carrier aircraft, the vehicle would need to pull up to maintain a normal acceleration of 2.0 g until reaching a designated flight path angle. This maneuver was designed as a compromise between high dynamic pressures and aero loads and would have provided no room for anything other than carry along experiments. During reentry, the X-34 would have been limited by an angle of attack profile that would have provided adequate temperature protection, but only subtle changes to these profiles could have been made during these two phases of flight, thus limiting the remainder of the flight to performing dynamic maneuvers or experiments.

The limited test time was a significant factor that may have contributed to the decision to reduce the number of flights in the X-34 program. Other factors that may have contributed to this decision include site selection and risk mitigation issues, which dragged on long enough for the plans to fly the X-34 to end before the drop or powered testing could even begin. The core aspects of the actual flight test program, including tow tests, unpowered drop tests, and planned powered flight tests, including flights to conduct experiments, also needed addressing. Among these, site selection was a very early and significant problem from both a technical and political standpoint, forcing a series of changes and schedule slippage that, in turn, contributed to the demise of the overall X-34 program. Risk mitigation decisions, which are covered in detail in chapter 9, were the final blow from which the X-34 could not recover.

In addition, the panel that reviewed the X-33 and X-34 programs in 2001 raised specific issues relating to the X-33 by noting that","['Promise Denied\n318\nThus, his views of X-34 are worth considering. In a March 2001 correspon\xad\ndence to Aviation Week & Space Technology, Burt Rutan commented on NASA’s \ndecision to cancel the X-34 before it could be flown:\nThe X-34s should be flown, not parked. Years behind due to \nproblems with a Government-developed engine and a NASA \nrisk-averse attitude toward flying a single-string flight control \nsystem, the program would still probably fail if left alone. Failure \nis assured by the decision late last month, with no return on the \n$200 million investment. What exists are two nearly complete \nflight articles and data that could have been generated without \nbuilding hardware. Once flown, you have gathered new informa\xad\ntion that you will be able to get from analysis. This is true whether \nthey fly fine and land smooth or make a smoking hole in the \ndesert. Send the X-34s to Mojave, I’ll fly them.55 \nBurt Rutan had it exactly right. There was nothing gained and much lost \nby failure to carry through with flight-testing of the robotically piloted X-34 \nTechnology Demonstrator vehicles that were already built and ready for flight-\ntesting. It should be noted that this viewpoint represents the near unanimous \nopinion of the NASA and Orbital engineers and officials interviewed in con\xad\nnection with the writing of this book. As already noted, however, funds to \ncomplete both the X-33 and X-34 were not forthcoming in the Space Launch \nInitiative, which was the follow-on program to the single-stage-to-orbit and \nreusable launch vehicle program. It is interesting to note that the NASA media \nrelease that announced the start of the Space Launch Initiative and the end of \nthe X-33 and X-34 projects stated with the same degree of optimism as had \nbeen presented when the DC-XA, X-33, and X-34 programs were started.56\nSix years after the retirement of the Space Shuttle, 16 years after the start \nof the Space Launch Initiative, and 21 years after the start of the single-stage-\nto-orbit reusable launch vehicle program, payloads were still launched to low-\nEarth orbit by expendable rockets, and American astronauts were still flown to \nthe International Space Station in Russian spacecraft. Failure to carry through \nwith the X-34 program truly represented a promise denied.', 'Captive-Carry, Ground Tow, and Planned Powered Testing\n229\nall characteristics in a particular part of the flight envelope should be \nachieved simultaneously; the program will have reduced risks, but will \nrequire a large number of flights; and the methodology also applies to \nthe individual subsystems. \n•\t Autonomous Vehicles: The advantage of an autonomous vehicle is \nthat it allows the designer to do things that would not be tolerated if \nflown by a human pilot. The disadvantage is that a pilot has the abil\xad\nity to feel the plane and adapt to its characteristics. For example, a \npilot can attempt to recover from an unanticipated problem while an \nautopilot simply performs the maneuvers it is programed to execute. \nAccordingly, the X-34 was required to have a high degree of mission \nflexibility, thus requiring a high degree of robustness of the autopilot. \n•\t Limited Test Time: The X-34 would have had very limited time \non each flight to perform dedicated testing. This is due to having \na low lift-to-drag ratio resulting in high rates of descent, and to the \nvehicles high degree of power, which once extinguished could not be \nrestarted. For unpowered flights the X-34 would have had approxi\xad\nmately 90\xa0seconds of dedicated test time between drop time and the \nacquisition of the glide slope. For powered flights, the flight condi\xad\ntions would have changed so rapidly that the X-34 could neither fly \nat a constant Mach number or dynamic pressure during ascent or \nreentry. After separation from the carrier aircraft, the vehicle would \nneed to pull up to maintain a normal acceleration of 2.0 g until reach\xad\ning a designated flight path angle. This maneuver was designed as \na compromise between high dynamic pressures and aero loads and \nwould have provided no room for anything other than carry along \nexperiments. During reentry, the X-34 would have been limited by an \nangle of attack profile that would have provided adequate temperature \nprotection, but only subtle changes to these profiles could have been \nmade during these two phases of flight, thus limiting the remainder of \nthe flight to performing dynamic maneuvers or experiments.16 \n•\t Binary Systems: X-34 binary systems included the main propulsion \nsystem, flight controls, flight termination system, and separation from \nthe carrier aircraft. All of these would have needed to work well on the \nfirst use in order prevent loss of the vehicle. This would have required \nadequate ground testing and/or analysis to be performed on each sys\xad\ntem. Also, as many of these systems as feasible should be tested while \nthe vehicle is in captive-carry in order to reduce the risk of losing \nthe\xa0vehicle.17 \n•\t Airspace Constraints: Operational airspace should be a by-product \nof the required mission and not a limitation imposed on good test', '223\nCHAPTER 8\nCaptive-Carry, Ground Tow, \nand Planned Powered Testing\nTesting the X-34 involved extensive planning, including setting priorities, \nselecting appropriate test sites, receiving FAA certification of the L-1011 car\xad\nrier aircraft with the attached X-34 vehicle, developing environmental impact \nstatements, and resolving risk mitigation issues. The core aspects of the actual \nflight test program—tow tests, unpowered drop tests, and planned powered \nflight tests, including flights to conduct experiments—also needed addressing. \nAmong these, site selection was a very early and significant problem from both \na technical and political standpoint, forcing a series of changes and schedule \nslippage that, in turn, contributed to the demise of the overall X-34 program. \nRisk mitigation decisions, which are covered in detail in chapter 9, were the \nfinal blow from which the X-34 could not recover. The site selection and \nrisk mitigation issues dragged on long enough for the plans to fly the X-34 \nTechnology Testbed Demonstrator to end before the drop or powered testing \ncould even begin.\nThe Importance of Ground and Flight Demonstrations\nFlight-testing has always marked the culmination of the aerospace develop\xad\nment process. In 1896, shortly before his death in a gliding accident, German \npioneer Otto Lilienthal wrote “One can get a proper insight into the practice \nof flying only by actual flying experiments…. It is in the air itself that we \nhave to develop our knowledge.”1 In 1901, Wilbur Wright, more famously, \ncompared flying to riding a fractious horse, noting “if you really wish to learn, \nyou must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks by actual \ntrial.”2 In 1967, testifying before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and \nSpace Sciences, NASA Administrator James E. Webb said: \nFlight-testing of new concepts, designs, and systems is fundamen\xad\ntal to aeronautics. Laboratory data alone, and theories based on \nthese data, cannot give all the important answers…. Each time a', 'NASA and the Post–Cold War Launch Vehicle Challenge\n23\nrequirements. As a result, hard space transportation policy choices \nmay go unmade. The panel added that even a central authority \nto resolve differences might not work because “[g]iven the con\xad\nsiderable bureaucratic and political weight of DoD and NASA, \ncompeting organizational interest could potentially override the \nwishes of a central authority. Furthermore, existing legal and \norganizational obstacles may prevent the level of interagency and \nprivate sector coordination sought by a central authority.”59\nIn addition, the panel pointed out that DOD and NASA had collectively \nproposed a sizable number of new space transportation technology initiatives \nand that these had added their own complexity and challenges, noting that \n\n“[w]hile this multitrack approach may reduce the overall risk of pursuing \nnew space transportation systems, it may also lead to potential conflicts and \nredundancies and higher overall costs. For example, development of a com\xad\nmercially competitive EELV [evolved expendable launch vehicle] by DoD \ncould undercut NASA’s effort to commercialize a follow-on X-33 by reducing \nthe incentive for private investors to fund a technically risky RLV.”60 \nThe panel also referenced both the potential value of the original X-34 \nconcept to the larger, more complex X-33 and, ironically, the risk that X-34 \nitself might be abandoned as being too “operationally” focused. “As for NASA’s \ndual-track RLV development strategy, they concluded, “the Agency believes \nthat early X-34 test flights could positively affect X-33 development by steering \nit toward or away from certain technologies. Moreover, proponents note that \nthe X-34 could generate significant benefits for the government, industry, and \nconsumers of space-based services if its target of threefold cost reductions for \nlaunching small payloads are achieved. Critics, however, have suggested cancel\xad\ning the X-34 program, arguing that it is geared toward developing an opera\xad\ntional vehicle, not an experimental vehicle, and that its cancellation would not \naffect the technological success of the X-33 program.”61 It should be noted that \nthe X-34 program referenced above related to the first “large X-34” program, \nas opposed to the follow-on X-34 that called for a much smaller technology \ntest bed demonstrator.\nThe panel raised specific issues relating to the X-33 by noting that some \nanalysts thought that the program was geared too closely to the development \nof a vehicle to get to the Space Station rather than toward the development of \na fully SSTO technology demonstrator. Other critics suggested a competitive \nfly-off for competing concepts in order to decrease the possibility of selecting \nthe wrong technology. They also believed that a fly-off would raise the likeli\xad\nhood of increasing competition in the domestic vehicle launch industry.

The decision to reduce the number of flights in the X-34 program was not due to a single factor, but rather a combination of concerns. These concerns included budget constraints, the loss of two Mars probes, and the lack of throttling capability of the Fastrac engine. The lack of throttling capability was particularly problematic because it was a required engine characteristic for conducting some of the experiments with the X-34 vehicles. 

Moreover, NASA became increasingly concerned about the robustness and redundancy of the X-34 program. This concern led to the restructuring of the program, which required a significant increase in funding and caused further schedule slippage. The restructuring was necessary due to potential safety hazards caused by the lack of redundancy in the vehicle control systems. 

In summary, the decision to reduce the number of flights in the X-34 program was due to a combination of budget constraints, safety concerns, the lack of throttling capability of the Fastrac engine, and the need for robustness and redundancy in the program."
Question: How does the IN SITU device help monitor stress levels in real time during spaceflight?,"The IN SITU device helps monitor stress levels in real time during spaceflight by collecting saliva samples from crew members using a swab, injecting them into a disposable cartridge, and initiating the analytical procedure. The device is portable and simple to use, and the process poses no risk to the operator or the space station environment. The device makes sensitive and specific quantitative measurement of biomarkers possible by using fluid samples obtained non-invasively, which can help monitor stress levels in real time.

Stress is a significant factor in spaceflight, and it can have negative effects on crew members' health and performance. The ability to monitor stress levels in real time can help identify potential issues and allow for interventions to mitigate them.

In addition to monitoring stress levels, the IN SITU device can also be used to monitor other physiological parameters that are affected by spaceflight, such as changes in vestibular function, intersensory interactions, spatial orientation, and visual tracking. These parameters can have significant implications for crew members' health and performance, particularly during critical tasks such as spacewalks or surface-based extravehicular activity.

The OculoStim-CM, Virtual and Sensomotor computerized systems developed by the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Russia can accurately assess the state of vestibular function, intersensory interactions, spatial orientation, and visual tracking. These systems use a special test battery to evaluate disruptions in various forms of eye movements and find the causes of these disturbances.

Overall, the IN SITU device and other systems developed for spaceflight have significant potential benefits on Earth as well, particularly for patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders, vestibular problems, and members of the elderly population who may be coping with multisensory deficit syndromes, immobilization, and inactivity.","['132\ninvasive double sensor is a highly useful diagnostic tool \nfor recognizing early warning signs of fatigue during \nspacewalks in orbit.

The minimum speed of flight \nbeing known, the take-off speed can be calculated. This gives the speed coefficient \nC of v equals V over the square root of g bC of v equals V over the square root of g bC of v equals V over the square root of g bC of v equals V over the square root of g bC of v equals V over the square root of g bC of v equals V over the square root of g bC of v equals V over the square root of g b. This permits the calculation of the lift and the drag at each of various \nangles of attack. The displacement at each angle of attack equals the total displace\xad\nment less the lift. The water resistance at each of these displacements is taken from \nthe curves of water resistance. The air drag is calculated for each of the angles of \nattack. The water resistance plus the drag gives the total resistance at each angle of \nattack. A curve of total resistance against angle of attack permits the choosing of \nthe angle of attack giving the minimum resistance.\nThe average of minimum-resistance trim angles against speed coefficient Cv \n(fig. 35) gives the value of desired trim angle. The difference between angle of \nattack chosen above and the trim angle is the angle of wing setting.\nIn order to calculate for the take-off time and the take-off resistance, it is neces\xad\nsary to determine the resistance at each speed from rest up to the termination of the \ntake-off. The curves of minimum-resistance trim angles against the speed coeffi\xad\ncients Cv using the displacement coefficient C∆ as a parameter are disposed to scatter \nslightly. A mean trim angle can be \ndrawn on these curves (see Fig. 35). \nUsing this mean curve, at any speed \ncoefficient Cv and consequently at \nany speed, we can determine the \nangle of attack, the lift coefficient \nat that angle of attack, the lift, and \nthe displacement; thence, the dis\xad\nplacement coefficient. The cross \ncurve of displacement coefficient C∆ \nagainst the resistance coefficient CR, \nhaving the parameter of speed coef\xad\nficient Cv, permits determining the Figure 35.

In the hydrovane method of testing models, the \nlift coefficient is assumed constant and is fixed at the value corresponding to the \ntake-off speed chosen. The error due to this is large at take-off speed. The angle \nof wing setting, being the only variable available, is established so that the angle of \nattack and the trim angle are such as to give the least total resistance near the take-\noff speed. A setting giving this least resistance at 80 to 90 per cent of the stalling \nspeed is satisfactory. A study of Fig. 37 will show the relationship between the trim \nangle of the float and the angle of attack of the wing. To obtain the wing-setting \nangle, it is necessary to calculate the total resistance (water and air) at 90 per cent \nof the stalling speed for several angles of attack. The stalling speed being known, \nthe take-off speed can be established. Using 90 per cent stalling speed as a criterion, \nthe lift coefficients at various angles of attack, and the wing area, the lift for each', '277\nDocument 5-20 (a–c)\nangle of attack can be calculated. The lift being known, the displacement at that \nangle of attack is the difference between the weight of the seaplane and the lift. The \ndrag for each angle of attack is calculated. The water resistance for each displace\xad\nment at each angle of attack considered is taken from the basin data. The resulting \nwater resistance plus drag at each angle of attack gives a series of total resistances \nfrom which the least total resistance can be \nselected. The angle of attack correspond\xad\ning to the smallest total resistance is that \nangle of attack desired at 90 per cent stall\xad\ning speed. The displacement corresponding \nto that angle of attack gives the clue to the \ntrim angle corresponding thereto. The dif\xad\nference between the angle of attack and the \ntrim angle is the angle of wing setting. This \nangle is subject to minor variation after the \ncomplete take-off calculation is made, since \nit may be that a slight change will give a bet\xad\nter result.\nNow, having established the wing set\xad\nting and selecting the trim angles corre\xad\nsponding to low water resistance, the angles \nof attack at the various speeds up to take-off \ncan be determined. The drag at each of these \nangles of attack and its corresponding speed can be calculated and plotted. The \nwater resistance is taken for the various speeds from the model-basin-test data. The \nhull can be assumed to be held at the trim angle giving least resistance throughout \nthe run, which gives fixed-trim angles, or the hull can be assumed to be free to trim \nup to the hump speed and at fixed trims beyond the hump speed. In any case, the \ntrim angle may vary with the speed, as is indicated by Fig. 35.\nBy plotting thrust and the two resistances against the speed or against a per\xad\ncentage of the take-off speed, a set of curves such as Fig. 32 is obtained. As plotted \nin this figure, the air resistance is deducted from the propeller thrust. It might have \nbeen added to the water resistance instead.

By continuously monitoring the engine's performance, the PSC can adjust the engine's parameters to optimize its efficiency and reduce fuel consumption. This results in operational efficiencies and longevity for high-performance aircraft.

The PSC was applied to a wide variety of aircraft, but it was especially suited to high-performance military aircraft. Pratt & Whitney used the self-tuning onboard model in its advanced engine controllers, including those on the F119-PW-100 engine used on the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor aircraft.

To continue with them meant increasing \ntheir size, weight, and expense, which introduced ramifications regarding the \ndesign and performance of the aircraft overall.9\nIntegrated Propulsion Control, Highly Integrated Digital \nElectronic Control, and Adaptive Engine Control\nAt the request of the U.S. Air Force, NASA researchers at the Dryden Flight \nResearch Center at Edwards Air Force Base in the high desert of California \nand at Lewis had assisted in the development and flight test of the first digi\xad\ntal integrated propulsion control system (IPCS) to be flown in an aircraft in \n1976. The team, which included Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Honeywell, \nselected an F-111 as the platform for two primary reasons. First, the aircraft \nfeatured a variable-geometry inlet and two afterburning turbofans, which \nallowed experimentation with the left-side engine while the other remained \nunaltered to ensure flight safety. Second, the IPCS proved capable of duplicat\xad\ning the standard hydro-mechanical inlet and engine controls that manipulated \nthe inlet spike and expanding the cone, fuel supply, compressor bleed, and \nnozzle area. Flight tests in 1976 exhibited faster throttle response, increased \nthrust, extended range at Mach 1.8, and—perhaps most importantly for the \nF-111—stall-free operation. The success of the IPCS in enhancing propulsion \nsystems in terms of efficiency, operability, reliability, and maintenance led to \nthe widespread use of digital inlet-engine controls technology in both military \nand commercial aircraft.10\nAs well, NASA used its F-15 to investigate and demonstrate a new method \nof obtaining optimum aircraft performance with computer-controlled engines \ncalled Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control (HIDEC).11 The experi\xad\nmental program explored new innovations to improve engine diagnostics, \ncontrol, and efficiency. The major components of HIDEC were a Digital \nElectronic Flight Control System (DEFCS), a Digital Electronic Engine \nControl (DEEC), an onboard general-purpose computer, and an integrated \narchitecture that allowed all of the components to interact with each other.12\nA full-authority DEEC regulated the operation of the F-15’s PW1128 \nturbofan. The DEEC scheduled and maintained the engine operating point \nthrough the use of two main control loops. The first used the main burner fuel \nflow to regulate the low rotor speed. The second controlled engine pressure with \nactuation of the nozzle throat area. The DEEC also controlled the front and rear \ncompressor variable vanes. The system monitored seven individual parameters: \nfan and high-pressure compressor speed, engine face and fan turbine inlet \ntemperature, and engine face, burner, and augmenter pressure.

NACA testing indicated \nthat noise in the speed sensor, coupled with the high gain of the speed gover\xad\nnor, limited the operation of the engine. GE and NACA engineers used the \ntime-domain step response analysis method to fix the problem by reducing the \ncontrol gain at altitude. The industry-Government cooperation established a \nknowledge base for the design of newer and better engine controls.4\nEdward W. Otto and Burt L. Taylor III at Lewis studied the behavior of \nsingle-shaft turbojet engines in 1948. They focused on shaft speed because \nit was nearly equivalent to thrust and could be easily and more accurately \nmeasured. Otto and Taylor learned that the transfer function from fuel flow \nto engine speed, regarded as the dynamic characteristic of a turbojet engine, \ncould be represented by a first-order lag linear system with a time constant.5\nEngine capabilities increased in the 1950s with new twin-spool turbojets \nlike the Collier Trophy–winning Pratt & Whitney J57 and high-compression-\nratio, bypass-flow turbofans. Engine control technologies followed suit. The \nstate of engine control technology matured to incorporate variable-geometry \ncontrols at the compressor stator, intake, and nozzle. The increased complica\xad\ntion posed challenges to effective evaluation by testing alone. A development \nthat took place outside of aviation, the introduction of increasingly sophis\xad\nticated computer technology, facilitated the use of computer-based real-time \ndynamic simulations for engine control design and analysis. Researchers James \nR. Ketchum and R.T. Craig at Lewis initiated this work with electronic analog \ncomputers in the early 1950s. They simulated the response of a turbojet engine \nto a step change in fuel flow and validated the results, which proved applicable \nto different types of gas turbine engines.6 That first step toward the accurate \nsimulation of complex engine dynamic behavior led to further advancements \nthat kept the cost and time involved in control design development and valida\xad\ntion in line with those of other technologies.7 In other words, efficient engine \ncontrol would not be a bottleneck in the development of new aircraft. By the \nlate 1960s, researchers were contemplating moving beyond traditional con\xad\ntrol systems and architectures to new ones making use of emergent powerful, \nlightweight airborne computers.\nThe Advent of Digital Electronic Engine Control\nThe advent of stability augmentation had stimulated controls research that \nevolved into electronic flight control. Research in the 1950s had led to ever-\nmore-heavily “augmented” aircraft that preceded the genuine “fly-by-wire” \naircraft of the 1970s–1980s pioneered by NASA.8 First applied to aircraft flight \ncontrols, electronic control then migrated to propulsion controls as well.

Engineers could program it using any of \nthe major computer languages, including Pascal, Ada, and FORTRAN.

This prototype F-111E was used during the flight testing of the Integrated Propulsion Control System (IPCS).

The program called integrated propulsion control system (IPCS) was a joint effort by NASA’s Lewis Research Center and Flight Research Center, the Air Force’s Flight Propulsion Laboratory and the Boeing, Honeywell and Pratt & Whitney companies. The left engine of the F-111E was selected for modification to an all electronic system. A Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-9 engine was modified and extensively laboratory, and ground-tested before installation into the F-111E. There were 14 IPCS flights made from 1975 through 1976. The flight demonstration program proved an engine could be controlled electronically, leading to a more efficient Digital Electronic Engine Control System flown in the F-15.\nFigure 5-2.

The Propulsion Control System (PSC) played a significant role in improving the efficiency and longevity of high-performance aircraft. By reducing fuel usage at cruise conditions, maximizing excess thrust during accelerations and climbs, and extending engine life by reducing the fan turbine inlet temperature, the PSC contributed to greater operational efficiencies and longevity for these aircraft.

The PSC system was especially suited to high-performance military aircraft and was applied to a wide variety of aircraft. Pratt & Whitney used the self-tuning onboard model in its advanced engine controllers, including those on the F119-PW-100 engine used on the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor aircraft.

Who is William Frederick Durand and what is his significance in the field of aeronautics and astronautics? Refer to the provided document for context.,"William Frederick Durand was a prominent figure in the field of aeronautics and astronautics, serving as the Chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) from 1915 to 1919 and again from 1924 to 1933. He was also a member of the NACA's Committee on Aerodynamics from 1915 to 1933, and served as its Chairman from 1917 to 1918. Durand's contributions to the NACA and the field of aeronautics and astronautics were significant and influential.

In 1917, the NACA appropriated $4,000 for Durand and Lesley's propeller research at the newly completed Stanford Aerodynamical Laboratory. This figure was 56 percent of the total budget of $7,100 for the Committee's special reports for the entire year, indicating the significance the Committee placed on propeller studies. That budget was second only to the $68,957 awarded for the construction of the Committee's research laboratory at Langley. The total NACA appropriation for 1917 was $87,515.70. By the middle of 1918, 38 percent of the NACA's total appropriations had been allocated to the Stanford propeller studies.

Durand and Lesley continued with their standard model propeller studies as well as experimenting with a variable-pitch propeller. Speaking before the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain in June 1918, Durand identified the variable-pitch propeller configuration as important to the overall refinement of airplane efficiency. He believed that development of a workable variable-pitch propeller was ""of the highest order of importance"" and ""outstanding as one of the appliances for which the art of aerial navigation is definitely in waiting.""

Paralleling Durand's opinions was the NACA's public request for assistance in the development of variable-pitch propellers. In the June 1, 1918, issue of Aviation and Aeronautical Engineering, the NACA's Special Sub-Committee on Engineering Pro","['NACA to NASA to Now\n8\nBoth men proved adept at work\xad\ning influential patrons at cocktail \nhours in such bon vivant water\xad\ning holes as the Army Navy Club \nand the Cosmos Club.

Both Lewis \nand Victory established a legacy of \neffective leadership in the NACA. \nThey would be followed by many \nothers who continued this guid\xad\nance in aeronautical\xa0R&D.\nLewis began recruiting young \nscientists, engineers, and math\xad\nematicians to enter federal service, \nusually for less pay than they could \nfind elsewhere. He promised them, \nhowever, an opportunity to per\xad\nform cutting-edge research and to \ntry sometimes hare-brained ideas \nthat had little immediate com\xad\nmercial application. These efforts \nworked, and by the time that \nthe NACA was transformed into \nNASA in 1958, it had developed an exceptionally positive reputation for inno\xad\nvative aeronautical research and development.\nA leading figure serving on the advisory committee, William Frederick \nDurand, provided steady leadership as the NACA began operations. An inter\xad\nnationally known teacher and researcher in aeronautical propulsion during the \nfirst half of the 20th century, Durand had created the aeronautical engineering \nprogram at Stanford University in the first part of the century. He was appointed \na member of the committee in 1915 and served until 1933, and chaired the \ncommittee in 1917–18. Over the years, most of the research conducted under \nNACA auspices was done in its own facilities, but until the first laboratory was \nconstructed at the end of World War I, the committee relied on contracts to \neducational institutions to undertake work. Durand’s research team at Stanford \nled the way with its NACA experimentation on propeller shapes. This would \nhave been considered a conflict of interest at a different time, but amid World \nWar I and the lax regulatory environment of the era, no one questioned it. \n\nFigure 1-3. George W. Lewis was one of the two \nmost significant figures in NACA history through \nWorld War II. He became the NACA’s Director \nof Aeronautical Research in 1924 and served \nuntil he retired in 1947.

There were differences between strict propeller design and the need to \nselect and incorporate efficient propellers into airplane design. Propeller design \ninvolves the meticulous creation of an efficient airfoil, while airplane design \nrequires that work to be already predetermined.23 Perceiving the propeller as \na major component within the technical system of the airplane reflected the \nCommittee’s desire to fulfill its goal of working toward the practical solution \nof the overall problems of flight.\nLater, in June 1918, Durand illustrated the technical systems approach \nto airplane design before the Royal Aeronautical Society of Great Britain. \nIn his delivery of the Annual Wilbur Wright Memorial Lecture, entitled \n“Some Outstanding Problems in Aeronautics,” Durand succinctly voiced the \nNACA’s position on propeller refinement within the broader sphere of airplane \ndesign. He defined a typical powered, heavier-than-air flying machine as “an \nairplane-motor-propeller combination” in which each of the three compo\xad\nnents was totally dependent on the others. The propeller was responsible for \none crucial function in this relationship: converting the motor’s energy into \npropulsive power to enable the aircraft’s wings and fuselage to generate lift.24 \nDurand and the NACA clearly believed that propeller research at Stanford \nUniversity would significantly contribute to the development of American \naeronautical\xa0technology.\nBefore embarking upon in-depth research, Durand and Lesley first had to \noversee the construction of the Stanford University Aerodynamical Laboratory \nduring the fall and winter of 1916–1917. Funding for laboratory construction \ncame from the initial propeller research contract of October 1916. Intent on \nstarting experiments by the spring of 1917, the Stanford professors wanted the \nfacility completed immediately to expedite research. They designed an Eiffel-\ntype wind tunnel with a 5.5-foot throat and a 55-mile-per-hour maximum test \nstream speed. The specific instruments the Stanford professors incorporated \ninto the laboratory were dynamometers for calculating thrust and torque, a \nrevolution counter, and an airspeed meter.25\nThe interaction between the NACA and Stanford University from 1915 \nto 1917 indicates the existence of a Government-research subrelationship. As \nthe NACA Chairman, Durand influenced the shaping of a national aeronauti\xad\ncal research and development policy that stressed the overall development of \nthe airplane through a technical system approach. As university researchers, \nDurand and Lesley gained prestige from performing and publishing research \nfor the Government.

This was \nnot uncommon. \nAll these employees contributed to a culture of innovation at the NACA. At \nevery step, aeronautical innovation presented itself to those involved in devel\xad\noping new technology. The choice of options helped to shape the course of \naeronautics, along with thousands of other choices made by designers at other \nlocations. Gradually a consensus emerged to move in a certain direction with \nthe technology. It did not emerge without complex interactions, differing ideas \nexpressed, mutually exclusive models built, and minority positions eventually \ndiscarded after considering different options.\nA Revolution in Aeronautics\nDuring the second half of the interwar period, significant technological and \neconomic advances came to aviation. The NACA was responsible for several \ngroundbreaking innovations during this period. Also during this time, congres\xad\nsional legislation and appropriations fueled rapid developments in the capability \nof aircraft in the United States. The period has been characterized as a time of \na “revolution in aeronautics.” \nTo a very real extent, aeronautical innovation is an example of heterogeneous \nengineering, which recognizes that technological issues are simultaneously \norganizational, economic, social, cultural, political, and on occasion irrational. \nVarious interests often clash in the decision-making process as difficult calcula\xad\ntions must be made. What perhaps should be suggested is that a complex web or \nsystem of ties between various people, institutions, and interests shaped aircraft \nas they eventually evolved. These ties made it possible to develop aircraft that \nsatisfied most of the priorities, achieving an optimum if not elegant solution.\nThe NACA’s efforts contributed to the development of the first modern airlin\xad\ners. The Boeing 247, based on a low-wing, twin-engine bomber with retractable \nlanding gear, accommodated 10 passengers and cruised at 155 miles per hour. \nIt paved the way for the airplane that represented the revolution in ways unseen \nbefore. The Douglas Aircraft Company’s DC-3 was the most prevalent com\xad\nmercial aircraft developed before World War II. Inaugurated in 1932 as a con\xad\ntract for Transcontinental and Western Airlines (TWA), it was a new all-metal, \nmono-winged, airliner. As a result of this, the famous Douglas Commercial \n(DC) series began. The DC-1 prototype of 1932 became the DC-2 that filled \nthe TWA order and then emerged in 1936 as the revolutionary DC-3 com\xad\nmercial transport. It accommodated 21 passengers while cruising at 180 miles', 'vi\nAcknowledgments\nAny author is in debt to many who help with the research and writing process. \nI wish to thank series editor Dr. Richard P\n.

The provided document discusses the historical context of hypersonic technology as presented in two volumes of The Hypersonic Revolution: Case Studies in the History of Hypersonic Technology, edited by Richard P. Hallion. The document highlights the evolution of hypersonic technology from its early beginnings to more recent developments.

Key milestones mentioned in the document include:

1. Max Valier's pioneering work in the 1920s, which laid the foundation for hypersonic research (Hallion, Richard P., ed. The Hypersonic Revolution: Case Studies in the History of Hypersonic Technology, volume I: From Max Valier to Project PRIME—1924-1967).

2. Project PRIME, an early hypersonic research project in the United States during the 1960s (Hallion, Richard P., ed. The Hypersonic Revolution: Case Studies in the History of Hypersonic Technology, volume I: From Max Valier to Project PRIME—1924-1967).

3. The development of scramjet technology, which is a critical component of hypersonic vehicles (Hallion, Richard P., ed. The Hypersonic Revolution: Case Studies in the History of Hypersonic Technology, volume II: From Scramjet to the National Aero-Space Plane—1964–1986).

4. The National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) project, which aimed to develop a hypersonic aircraft capable of reaching orbit (Hallion, Richard P., ed. The Hypersonic Revolution: Case Studies in the History of Hypersonic Technology, volume II: From Scramjet to the National Aero-Space Plane—1964–1986).

These milestones demonstrate the progression of hypersonic technology and the ongoing efforts to advance this field."
"Question: How did the 1973 oil embargo impact the aviation industry, particularly in terms of jet fuel supply and prices?","The 1973 oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in retaliation for America’s having supported Israel during the Arab-Israeli war resulted in a near-disastrous cut in the supply of, and an increase in the price of, jet fuel. The embargo caused a serious reevaluation of what constitutes performance in aviation, specifically fuel consumption, as the airlines were in a dire situation. They could not drive away customers by reducing service or raising ticket prices as they faced an escalation of fuel prices that was estimated to be between 20 to 50 percent. The Senate requested that NASA address the issue of increased fuel prices and anticipated oil shortages in January 1975. NASA offered a solution for the fuel crisis, which consolidated existing propulsion, aerodynamics, and structures programs into the Aircraft Energy Efficiency (ACEE) program, which would cost $670 million while promising fuel savings of $1.3 billion year, or the equivalent of 333,000 barrels a day in fuel savings. The ACEE program aimed for considerable reduction in noise and emissions, with engines up to 10 decibels quieter and 60 percent cleaner as the 1960s and 1970s progressed.","['103\nCHAPTER 4\nThe Quest for Propulsive Efficiency,\n1976–1989\nIn the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the United States assisted Israel, which \nwas desperately fighting a defensive war, by supplying it with aircraft, tanks, \nammunition, weapons, and intelligence. The war marked an important stage \nin the evolution of integrated air defenses, and afterward, America embarked \nupon an intensive program of electronic warfare research that would lead to \nmore sophisticated antimissile attack systems and the development of the \nF-117 and B-2 stealth aircraft. But of more immediate consequence was \nthe imposition of a brief yet crippling oil embargo upon the United States, \nundertaken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \nin retaliation for America’s having supported the Jewish state. It reduced \nthe amount of oil available to the United States by almost 20 percent, or \nthree million barrels a day. The resultant decrease in petroleum products and \nincrease in prices created an energy crisis that affected the lives of everyday \nAmericans.1 For the airlines, the embargo resulted in a near-disastrous cut in \nthe supply of, and an increase in the price of, jet fuel. The Nixon adminis\xad\ntration implemented mandatory Federal control of jet fuel, heating oil, and \nmiddle distillate supplies on November 1, 1973, which set supplies at lower \n1972 levels. With the number of people traveling by air growing exponentially, \nthe outcome commercial air carriers wanted least was to reduce service. For \nAmerican Airlines’ legendary Chairman C.R. Smith, there was “no chance” \nthat the airlines could survive a 10-percent reduction in current schedules \ndue to fuel rationing.2\nWith oil prices low through most of the 1960s, there seemed to be no con\xad\ncerns over fuel efficiency in aviation. With cheap fuel and turbofan engines, \nwhich operated at about 65 percent efficiency, the airlines were making \nincreased revenues. That perspective changed as the OPEC embargo sent the \nUnited States and Europe reeling. No longer would energy sources be unlim\xad\nited or cheap in Western societies, whose technological infrastructure depended \non oil. While automakers reacted with compact, fuel-efficient cars and drivers \nadapted by traveling less, the airlines were in a dire situation. They could not \ndrive away customers by reducing service or raising ticket prices as they faced', 'The Power for Flight\n104\nan escalation of fuel prices that was estimated to be between 20 to 50 percent.3 \nSuccessive oil crises that have stymied the West since the 1970s have caused a \nserious reevaluation of what constitutes performance in aviation. Specifically, \nfuel consumption has become a matter of economic survival.\nThere was a technical impetus reflecting these changes. The era of “higher, \nfaster, and farther” reached a technical plateau during the latter half of the 20th \ncentury. Operational high-performance aircraft speeds and altitudes, which \nhad been consistently increasing since December 1903, peaked at Mach\xa03.3 \nand 85,000 feet around 1970, with the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird strate\xad\ngic reconnaissance aircraft, powered by Pratt & Whitney J58 turbo-ramjet \nengines. The choices designers made changed to reflect an emphasis on other \nparameters. Issues of electronic flight and propulsion control, aerodynamic \nand propulsive efficiency, fuel efficiency, lower costs, improved reliability \nand safety, and awareness of environmental issues related to emissions and \nnoise augmented and often superseded the decades-old driving philosophy \nof aircraft design based solely on altitude, speed, and range.4 In terms of fuel \nefficiency and emissions, the 1970s presented NASA with an opportunity \nto, in the words of one historian, “reclaim its mantle at the forefront of \naeronautics\xa0research.”5\nAircraft Energy Efficiency: \nOnset of a Transformational Program\nEchoing that shift in emphasis, the U.S. Senate Committee on Aeronautical \nand Space Sciences, chaired by Senator Frank E. Moss (D-UT) and \nBarry\xa0M.\xa0Goldwater (R-AZ), recognized the threat to the American airline \nindustry and the aviation industry in general. The Senate requested that \nNASA address the issue of increased fuel prices and anticipated oil shortages in \nJanuary 1975.6 NASA offered a solution for the fuel crisis. Speaking before the \nCommittee, Administrator James C. Fletcher asserted that there was potential \nto halve the fuel requirement for commercial jet aircraft by 1985. He advo\xad\ncated low-drag wing shapes, lightweight composite materials, improved engine \nefficiencies, and modified flying procedures to reduce landing time. Fletcher \nargued that the implementation of those new technologies and practices on the \n2,100 commercial airliners in American service would amount to $1.3 billion \nyear, or the equivalent of 333,000 barrels a day in fuel savings.7\nWith political pressure intensifying, NASA formed the Aircraft Fuel \nConservation Technology Task Force in February 1975 to explore poten\xad\ntial options. The team formulated a 10-year plan that consolidated existing \npropulsion, aerodynamics, and structures programs into the Aircraft Energy \nEfficiency (ACEE) program, which would cost $670 million while promising', 'The Shift Toward Commercial Aviation, 1966–1975\n95\nsands by 1980. Nevertheless, increasing the supply of jet fuel faced economic \nand environmental challenges. The office estimated that fuel derived from shale \nrequired an increase in production from 900 barrels per day in 1975 to 250,000 \nper day in 1980. The more widely available coal needed to expand from 10 \nbarrels per day to 6,000. Tar sands, which presumably existed in quantities \nsimilar to the remaining reserves of domestic petroleum, required starting the \nrefining process from scratch—from no barrels to 7,000 a day within 5 years.86\nI. Irving Pinkel, a consulting engineer and former head of the Physics Division \nat Lewis, prepared a report for the Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and \nDevelopment (AGARD) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \nin 1975 on the future of aviation fuels based on discussions with leading experts \nin the NATO countries. Technology could do only so much. Advanced tur\xad\nbofan engine components offered an estimated 15-percent reduction in fuel \nconsumption. Pinkel stressed that “any great gains in fuel consumption would \nprobably be by use of other engine concepts such as turboprops.” While petro\xad\nleum sources continued to dwindle, Pinkel emphasized that over the course of \nthe next half century, the American and European aviation industries would \nhave to accept fuels very different from those available in the mid-1970s due \nto escalating costs and plummeting availability.87\nOverall, the panel argued that any high-level work on aircraft fuel conserva\xad\ntion technology had to include fuel properties, especially regarding how they \nwere to be affected by changing resources. In other words, a national fuel effort \nthat started at the oil refinery would be the only way to contribute to aircraft \nefficiency overall.88', '73\nCHAPTER 3\nThe Shift Toward Commercial\nAviation, 1966–1975\nBy 1970, the United States aviation industry manufactured 74 percent of all \ncommercial aircraft in the free world, with $3 billion in revenues generated \nby overseas business—thanks, in large part, to NACA and NASA aeronauti\xad\ncal research conducted from 1950 to 1970. But as NASA worked to improve \nmilitary turbofans, there was a growing fear that United States was falling \nbehind as a world leader in commercial aviation technology. Competition from \nstate-supported manufacturers in Europe in the form of Airbus Industrie and \nrecently Rolls-Royce, Ltd., was growing, and consequently there was a con\xad\ntinued push in Congress to keep American aeronautics moving forward. The \nUnited States appeared to be behind in the development of new technologies \nsuch as Vertical and Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL), following its con\xad\ntroversial decision to choose, largely for nontechnical reasons, to abandon its \neffort to develop a supersonic transport that could travel faster than Mach\xa02.5. \nThe House Committee on Science and Astronautics was fully aware of the \n“increasing deficiencies” in the national aeronautical effort. Congressman \nGeorge P\n. Miller (D-CA) of California was an especially vocal supporter of \nNASA. The Agency had the talent and expertise to confront national prob\xad\nlems, but it needed the full support of the Government to do so. Otherwise, \nthe future security and prosperity of the United States was in “great peril.”1\nAmerican manufacturers GE and Pratt & Whitney dominated the turbofan \nmarket and invested considerable funding in meeting the needs of the airline \nindustry. For them, the bottom line was increased fuel efficiency. NASA took \nthe lead in two areas that did not affect the bottom line—noise and emis\xad\nsions—and aimed for considerable reduction, with engines up to 10 decibels \n(dB) quieter and 60 percent cleaner as the 1960s and 1970s progressed.2 From \nthe late 1920s to the present, commercial airlines have consistently pursued \nthe increase of payload capacity and engine efficiency. Since the 1960s, they \nhave had to recognize a third driving force in aviation: compliance with the \nFAA’s noise regulations.\nBy the early 1970s, noise in everyday life was an increasingly widespread \nsocial concern.

Question: What is the role of the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office in the Discovery and New Frontiers Program?,"The Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office plays a crucial role in the Discovery and New Frontiers Program by providing a neutral center for the proposing community.

The office advocates for risk-based insight and oversight, with the ability to be hands-on and provide assistance or additional review in the face of problems. The office conducted a study to investigate cost growth in the Discovery and New Frontiers Program, which was much more thorough in its methodology.

NASA Headquarters responded by adding layers of documentation, no \nlonger constrained by the workforce available when the office consisted of only Jarrett \nand Wolf. “We were ‘better, faster, cheaper,’” recalled Jarrett. “If there is something you \ndon’t need to do, you don’t do it. You don’t just build documentation as prescribed and \nat the time it wasn’t prescribed.”30\nProgram scientist Michael New added: “On a day-to-day basis, the mission manag\xad\ners at the program office are the ones who are almost daily, if not hourly, [in] contact \nwith the [project managers and] sometimes the PIs.” A project in development could \nexpect weekly teleconferences with the program executive, Program Scientist, and \nD&NFPO, in addition to the PI. The Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office \nadvocated risk-based insight and oversight, with the ability to be hands-on and pro\xad\nvide assistance or additional review in the face of problems. “One of the things they’ve \nbeen able to tap into is the large body of [Exploration Systems Mission Directorate] \n[and Space Operations Mission Directorate] engineers at Marshall who decide they’re \na little tired of working on projects that either will never see the light of day or won’t \nsee the light of day until they’re retired.” At the D&NFPO, however, engineers could \nget a broad view of the program and “see multiple missions go through their entire \n30 \t\nNiebur, S.

It had been led for years by Dave Jarrett and \nstaffed by Kate Wolf, who was badged by NASA Headquarters, with education and \npublic outreach leadership by Shari Asplund, who was badged by JPL. NASA asked \nJPL to undertake management of a new office that would report up through the JPL \nmanagement chain, hoping that it would give the lab more ownership of, and coop\xad\neration between, the projects and the project office. JPL had experience with such an \narrangement through its Mars Program Office, headed by Firouz Naderi since 2000.107\nOn 7 January 2004, Charles Elachi, Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \nannounced the formation of the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office at JPL.\nMeanwhile, cost overruns from two Discovery missions—MESSENGER and Deep \nImpact—severely delayed the release of what would have been the 2002, and then 2003, \nbut what was finally the 2004 Announcement of Opportunity for a new Discovery \nmission. In October 2002, Deep Impact needed $7.4 million, so the AO was pushed to \nJanuary 2003. But then MESSENGER needed $3.2 million. This pushed the AO until \nApril. But Deep Impact needed an additional $14.4 million, which pushed the release \nto August. Then MESSENGER needed $9.5 million for its Phase E, which delayed the \nAO until October. Lastly, the Mercury mission needed another $11.9 million, pushing \nthe AO to 2004, when it was finally released.108\n105 \t\nWeiler, E.

As this book has discussed, there were other decisions that impacted the mis\xad\nsions, such as lack of cash flow forcing the postponement of start dates of studies or \nmission formulation (i.e., Dawn and Kepler). This study did not address the effects of \nthese changes and excluded any conclusions that could be drawn from programmatic \nor division-level changes. \nEarly briefings discussed mission-specific and overall issues identified by the study: \n…technology challenges; longevity engineering issues; higher than anticipated ($1M/year) \nimplementation costs of the NASA Integrated Action Team recommendations; higher than \nexpected development costs for science instruments (exceeding preliminary design estimate \nby $18 million during Phase C/D in one instance (with the problem attributed to a contrac\xad\ntor)); and lack of a revalidated vendor quote since the Concept Study Report (CSR) estimate. \nAnother project had start-stop issues due to the events of September 11, 2001.

The Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office plays a significant role in the Discovery and New Frontiers Program. It is responsible for managing the program, including overseeing the Announcements of Opportunity (AO), which are used to solicit proposals for new missions. The office also provides support to the Principal Investigators (PIs) of selected missions, helping to ensure their successful implementation. Additionally, the office is responsible for developing and implementing the Implementation Plan for the program, which outlines the goals and objectives of the program and how they will be achieved. The Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office also plays a role in collaborating with other organizations and agencies, as well as managing the budget for the program."
"""What were the circumstances surrounding the V-22 Osprey's first flight, and what serious problems were encountered during its flight test program?""","The V-22 Osprey's first flight occurred on March 19, 1989, at Bell's Flight Research Center in Arlington, Texas. However, the flight test program of the V-22, which involved six Full Scale Development (FSD) aircraft, was not without serious problems. Two of the FSD aircraft crashed and were destroyed, with one crash taking the lives of all seven people on board. However, it was determined that these accidents were not due to the inherent characteristics of this vehicle, and the program survived.

During the flight test program, the engines and engine service men had no opportunity before flight tests to accurately set the relief pressure of the relief valve in an engine oil pump before flight tests. After one engine was stopped, the relief valve was removed, reset, reassembled, and the engine started again. This allowed the scheduled test flight to proceed without delay.

The mere fact that the crew could diagnose the trouble, even though no repairs could be made, was of tremendous value. For example, on one flight, hot engine oil was found leaking on the deck. A loose connection on the vacuum system oil separator drain line was quickly discovered, and a method of catching this oil was quickly rigged up, allowing the flight to continue.

All tanks, valves, and the greater portion of the plumbing for the engine lubrication, deicer fluid, hydraulic oil, water vacuum, and fuel systems are accessible in flight. This means that inspections may be made periodically during flight and trouble discovered before it reaches dangerous proportions.

The V-22's passenger accommodations were designed to provide unprecedented comfort, spaciousness, and luxury at reasonable weight and cost. The passengers' deck is divided into eleven sections, including five standard compartments seating ten and sleeping six, one special compartment seating four and sleeping two, one deluxe compartment seating six and sleeping two, a dining salon seating fourteen at five tables, a galley, a dressing room for men, a dressing room for the ladies, and three toilet compartments.

Based on the provisions for the crew and the ease of inspection and maintenance, we conclude that the V-22's design fulfills the third design criteria for efficiency of operations.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n822\nTo satisfy the teaming requirement, two companies that had been competitors, \nBell and Boeing, joined forces. Although this would bring together the world’s \ngreatest resources of tilt rotor technology, it left no credible competitors in the U.S. \nrotorcraft industry. When the RFP for the V-22 was issued, only the Bell-Boeing \nteam responded. While this presented a dilemma for advocates of competitive pro\xad\ncurements, the qualifications of the team, coupled with strong political advocacy \nfrom the powerful Texas and Pennsylvania congressional representatives, provided \nthe support needed to proceed. The successful advocacy of this program is credited \nto strong congressional support, confirming the observation by political analyst \nBrenda Foreman that “if the politics don’t fly, the hardware never will.”\nOn March 19, 1989, the first flight of the Osprey was conducted at Bell’s \nFlight Research Center at Arlington[,] Texas, the site of the first XV-15 flight \ntwelve years earlier. Bell test pilot Dorman Cannon (who was also onboard the \nXV-15 during its first test flight) and Boeing Helicopter test pilot Dick Balzer were \nat the controls. The first full conversion to airplane mode was flown on September \n14, 1989. Figure\xa075 [not reproduced] shows one of the V-22 EMD (Engineering \nManufacturing Development) aircraft during early flight tests.\nThe flight test program of the V-22, however, was not without serious prob\xad\nlems. Of the six Full Scale Development (FSD) aircraft planned for the flight test \nefforts (of which only five were completed), two crashed and were destroyed, with \none crash taking the lives of all seven people on board. However, it was determined \nthat these accidents were not due to the inherent characteristics of this vehicle \ntype[,] and the program survived.\nAs of late 1999, the V-22 Osprey is undergoing operational testing by the U.S. \nNavy and initial operational capability (IOC) is planned for the year 2001. On \nSeptember 8, 1999, the first production V-22 delivered to the U.S. Marine Corps \nlanded at the Pentagon for a tilt rotor demonstration hosted by Secretary of Defense \nWilliam S. Cohen. A CH-46 (the helicopter that will be replaced by the V-22) \nand XV-15 proof-of-concept aircraft, in Coast Guard colors, landed along side the \nOsprey. After several members of Congress flew in the new V-22 tilt rotor trans\xad\nport, Secretary Cohen described it as a “revolution in military affairs.” Based on the \ntechnology demonstrated by the XV-15 TRRA, the V-22 will bring capabilities to \nthe U.S. armed services that are not available in any other vehicle.\nUAV\nTilt rotor aircraft technology also offers performance and operational capa\xad\nbilities that are highly desirable for unmanned aircraft being developed for mili\xad\ntary applications. The ability to takeoff and land from a very small area, such as \na landing pad onboard a ship, coupled with a large radius of action, high altitude \nperformance, and a high cruise speed to get to the target area[,] quickly provides a \ncombination of attributes that meet the needs of the military users.', 'Table of Contents\nxvii\n5-51, Michael K.

Farrell, Bell Helicopter Textron, Fort Worth, TX, \n“Aerodynamic Design of the V-22 Osprey Proprotor,” \npresented at the 45th Annual Forum of the American \nHelicopter Society, Boston, MA, 22–24 May 1989, \ncopy in Technical Library, NASA Langley.\nFirst flown experimentally on 19 March 1989, two months before this American \nHelicopter Society presentation by Bell Helicopter engineer Michael K. Farrell, the \nV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor ranks as the first aircraft designed from the ground up to \nmeet the needs of all four U.S. armed services. Not only was it meant to transport \nMarine Corps assault troops and cargo using its medium-lift and vertical takeoff \nand landing capabilities, but it also met U.S. Navy requirements for combat search \nand rescue, fleet logistics support, and special warfare support. It was also designed \nto be used by Special Operations Forces. As it moved through its development in the \nlate 1980s and 1990s, the V-22 demonstrated that it could carry 24 combat troops, \nor up to 20,000 pounds of internal or external cargo—and at twice the speed \nof a conventional helicopter. A partnership between Boeing and Bell Helicopter \nTextron produced this unique aircraft, with Boeing responsible for its fuselage and \nall subsystems, digital avionics, and fly-by-wire flight-control systems, and Bell for \nthe wing, transmissions, empennage, rotor systems, and engine installation.\nBy the late 1990s, the Osprey had set unofficial world records for rotorcraft for \ncarrying very heavy loads at very high speeds. In April 1999, for example, one of \nthe Ospreys demonstrated this weight-lifting capability by externally lifting a new \n155-millimeter howitzer, one that weighed about 9,200 pounds. Never before had \nany rotorcraft ever carried such a heavy load externally, especially at speeds of up \nto 220 knots. During the course of its flight testing, the V-22 also demonstrated \nthat it flew with such stability that it could successfully hook up to an aerial refu\xad\neling drogue behind a KC-130 tanker. In the view of its proponents, this in-flight \nrefueling capability would permit the V-22 to deploy worldwide. Beyond that, \nflight tests demonstrated its great effectiveness in landing in confined areas dur\xad\ning both day and night and operating tactically at low altitudes over complicated \nterrain. The Osprey could dispense flare decoys and radar-defeating chaff, which \ngreatly enhanced its chances of survival in threatening environments. In airplane \nmode, the V-22 proved that it could sustain flight at altitudes of only 500 feet \nabove ground level (AGL) and at only 200 feet AGL while “partially converted,” \ni.e., with engine nacelles rotated between airplane and hover mode. In the view \nof military test pilots who flew the machine, these tactical abilities would prove \ncritical to V-22 pilots as they flew during missions to avoid detection and take', '839\nDocument 5-51\ncrashed near Tucson, Arizona, on 8 April 2000. As our manuscript went to press, \nthe Pentagon still had not determined the cause of the accident.\nThere is no reason, however, to speculate that the cause of the accident had \nanything to do with the Osprey’s basic aerodynamic design. More than 10 years of \ndevelopmental research and flight testing has confirmed the basic findings reported \nby Bell’s Michael Farrell in 1989. Though the design of an effective tilt-rotor air\xad\ncraft—one that takes off and lands like a helicopter but, once airborne, rotates \nits engine nacelles to convert the aircraft to a turboprop airplane capable of high-\nspeed, high-altitude flight—faces many challenges, the V-22 has very successfully \nmet and exceeded its design goals.\nDocument 5-51, Michael K. Farrell, Bell Helicopter Textron, Fort Worth, TX, \n“Aerodynamic Design of the V-22 Osprey Proprotor,” \npresented at the 45th Annual Forum of the American \nHelicopter Society, Boston, MA, 22–24 May\xa01989\nABSTRACT\nThis paper describes the aerodynamic design of the V-22 Osprey proprotor \nin terms of design objectives, design parameters, and design verification. During \nthe development of the proprotor, the three design objectives were a hover Figure \nof Merit of 0.8, a propulsive efficiency of 0.8, and a maximum proprotor blade \nloading or tc of 0.4. Based on these design objectives and in conjunction with per\xad\nformance, operational, and service constraints, the diameter, number of blades, tip \nspeed, airfoil, twist, chord, taper ratio, and spinner configuration were selected. \nThese design parameters were verified by means of numerous small and large scale \nmodel tests.', '345\nDocument 5-23 (a–c)\nflight tests to date indicate that the advantages realized far exceed even our expec\xad\ntations. An example or two may be of interest: One time the ship was moored out \nin Lake Washington and an attempt was made to start the engines. Three engines \nstarted nicely but the fourth engine refused to respond. The flight engineer soon \ndetermined that the engine was not getting prime, so one of the crew members went \nout into the nacelle, removed the primer solenoid, operated the valve by hand, and \nthe engine started immediately and the flight test program was carried out. This all \nhappened so quickly that some of the other crew members and those on shore had no \nidea that there had been any trouble. Another time some changes had been made in \nthe engines and the engine service men had no opportunity before flight tests to accu\xad\nrately set the relief pressure of the relief valve in an engine oil pump before flight tests. \nAfter we had been in the air several minutes that engine was stopped, the relief valve \nremoved, reset, reassembled, and the engine started again. Our scheduled test flight \nwould have been delayed had we not been able to make the final setting in the air.\nThere can be no doubt that the mere fact that you may diagnose the trouble, \neven though no repairs can be made, is of tremendous value. For example, on one \nflight quite a quantity of hot engine oil was found leaking on the deck. It would \nbe natural to suppose that one of the engine oil systems had failed, but with all \nlines accessible, it was quickly discovered that there was a loose connection on the \nvacuum system oil separator drain line. A method of catching this oil was quickly \nrigged up and the flight continued. If no diagnosis could have been made, the crew \nwould have been obliged to land the aircraft under the circumstances.\nAll tanks, valves and the greater portion of the plumbing for the engine lubri\xad\ncation, deicer fluid, hydraulic oil, water vacuum and fuel systems are accessible in \nflight. This means that inspections may be made periodically during flight and \ntrouble discovered before it reaches dangerous proportions. It is believed this type \nof design contributes immeasurably to the efficiency and safety of operation so \nnecessary for long-range flights.\nBased, in part, on the provisions for the crew and on the ease of inspection and \nmaintenance, we conclude that the second requirement for efficiency of operations \nis fulfilled.\nWe now come to our third design criteria [sic] and, naturally, the one which \nmost concerns the traffic departments: the passenger accommodations. The design \nproblem was to provide passenger accommodations which embodied unprece\xad\ndented comfort, spaciousness, and luxury at reasonable weight and cost.\nThe passengers’ deck is divided into eleven sections: five standard compart\xad\nments seating ten and sleeping six, one special compartment seating four and sleep\xad\ning two, one deluxe compartment seating six and sleeping two, and a dining salon \nseating fourteen at five tables, a galley, a dressing room for men, a dressing room for \nthe ladies, and three toilet compartments.\nThus, for this standard arrangement, seventy-four passengers can be seated in \nthe daytime, at night thirty-four berths may be set up, still leaving fourteen seats']","

What is the significance of Pioneer in the context of space exploration as mentioned in the document? Provide specific mission names and their contributions.,"The Pioneer missions, specifically Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, have significantly contributed to our understanding of the outer solar system and beyond. In 1972, Pioneer 10 was launched, becoming the first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter, providing scientists with their first close-up view of the planet. Pioneer 11 followed in 1973, providing similar data about Jupiter and later encountering Saturn in 1974. Both spacecraft continued on their journeys, with Pioneer 10 officially departing the solar system in 1990 and Pioneer 11 following suit in 1995. These remarkable space probes stretched from a 30-month design life cycle into a mission of more than 20 years, returning useful data not just about the Jovian planets of the solar system but also about some of the mysteries of the interstellar universe.","['291\nCHAPTER 12\u2002 •\u2002 International Cooperation In Solar System Exploration \nscientific results and stimulating the nation’s aerospace industry.”21 From \n1968 to 1971, Elliot had mixed success in mustering support for an out-of-\necliptic mission, but ultimately his efforts resulted in a 1972 European Space \nResearch Organisation (ESRO) mission-definition study.22\nBy the early 1970s, U.S. space scientists were also considering the feasi\xad\nbility of an OOE mission. It was seen as a potential candidate for NASA’s \nemerging solar system exploration program. By this time, U.S. scientists \nand engineers were already solving problems relating to an OOE mission \n(and, by extension, technical issues facing future interplanetary probes).23 \nIn July 1971, NASA Ames Research Center published a “Pioneer H Jupiter \nSwingby Out-of-Ecliptic Mission Study.”24 The 128-page report laid out a sci\xad\nentific rationale for the mission; established mission requirements, a range \nof mission possibilities, and a mission design; evaluated the suitability of \nthe Pioneer spacecraft for this mission; and investigated the feasibility of a \nlaunch in 1974.25 While the report outlined a number of different launch \nand hardware configurations, the proposed Pioneer OOE would use a spare \nPioneer spacecraft for Pioneers F and G (which would became Pioneers 10 \nand\xa011).26 \nFor the next few years, attempts by U.S. scientists to persuade NASA offi\xad\ncials to use the backup Pioneer spacecraft for an OOE mission were unsuc\xad\ncessful.

Writing to NASA Associate Administrator \nfor Space Science and Applications John Naugle, Norman Ness, chief of \nthe Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at NASA Goddard Space Flight \nCenter, expressed concerns about the use of the backup Pioneer.

Both spacecraft used a basic cylindrical \nbus. Pioneer Venus 1, the orbiter, was designed to \nspend an extended period in orbit around Venus \nmapping the surface using a radar package. After \na six-and-a-half-month-long journey, the space\xad\ncraft entered an elliptical orbit around Venus at \n15:58\xa0UT on 4 December 1978. It was the first \nAmerican spacecraft to enter orbit around Venus, \nabout three years after the Soviets accomplished \nthe same feat. The initial orbital period was 23 \nhours, 11 minutes, which was altered within two \norbits to the desired 24 hours—a maneuver that \nwould allow the orbit’s high and low points (about \n160 kilometers) to occur at the same time each \nEarth day. Data from the radar mapper allowed sci\xad\nentists to produce a topographical map of most of \nthe Venusian surface between 73° N and 63° S at a \nresolution of 75 kilometers. The data indicated that \nVenus was much more smooth and spherical than \nEarth. The orbiter identified the highest point on \nVenus as Maxwell Montes, which rises 10.8 kilome\xad\nters above the mean surface. Infrared observations \nimplied a clearing in the planet’s atmosphere over \nthe north pole. In addition, ultraviolet light photos \nshowed dark markings that covered the clouds in \nthe visible hemisphere. Cameras also detected \nalmost continuous lightning activity in the atmo\xad\nsphere. The spacecraft confirmed that Venus has \nlittle, if any magnetic field. Because of the nature of \nits orbit, Pioneer Venus 1 passed through the plan\xad\net’s bow shock twice per revolution, and using its \nmagnetometer, scientists were able to observe how \nthe planet’s ionosphere interacted with the solar \nwind.

This geometric lineup made possible close-up observation of \nthese giants on a single mission, the so-called Grand Tour. The flyby of each \nplanet would bend the spacecraft’s flightpath and increase its velocity enough \nto deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated \nprocess known as “gravity assist,” something like a slingshot effect, whereby the \nflight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years.\nTo prepare the way for the Grand Tour, in 1964 NASA conceived Pioneer \n10 and 11 as outer solar system probes. Although severe budgetary constraints \nprevented starting the project until the fall of 1968 and forced a somewhat less \nambitious effort, Pioneer 10 was launched on 3 March 1972. It arrived at Jupiter \non the night of 3 December 1973, and although many were concerned that the \nspacecraft might be damaged by intense radiation discovered in Jupiter’s orbital \nplane, the spacecraft survived, transmitted data about the planet, and contin\xad\nued on its way out of the solar system.\nIn 1973 NASA launched Pioneer 11, providing scientists with their first \nclose-up view of Jupiter. The close approach and the spacecraft’s speed of \n107,373 mph, by far the fastest speed ever reached by an object launched from \nEarth, hurled Pioneer 11 1.5 billion miles across the solar system toward Saturn, \nencountering the planet’s south pole within 26,600 miles of its cloud tops in \nDecember 1974. In 1990, Pioneer 11 officially departed the solar system by \npassing beyond Pluto and headed into interstellar space toward the center of the \nMilky Way galaxy. Pioneer 11 ended its mission 30 September 1995, when the \nlast transmission from the spacecraft was received.\nNASA received Pioneer 10’s last, very weak signal on 22 January 2003. At \nlast contact, Pioneer 10 was 7.6 billion miles from Earth, or 82 times the nomi\xad\nnal distance between the Sun and Earth. At that distance, it takes more than \n11\xa0hours, 20 minutes for the radio signal, traveling at the speed of light, to reach \nEarth. It will continue to coast silently as a ghost ship into interstellar space, \nheading generally for the red star Aldebaran, which forms the eye of the con\xad\nstellation Taurus (The Bull). Aldebaran is about 68 light-years away. It will take \nPioneer 10 more than 2 million years to reach it. “From Ames Research Center \nand the Pioneer Project, we send our thanks to the many people at the Deep \nSpace Network (DSN) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), who made \nit possible to hear the spacecraft signal for this long,” said Pioneer 10 Flight \nDirector David Lozier at the time of the last contact.8\nBoth Pioneer 10 and 11 were remarkable space probes, stretching from a \n30-month design life cycle into a mission of more than 20 years and returning \nuseful data not just about the Jovian planets of the solar system but also about \nsome of the mysteries of the interstellar universe.']","
Pioneer is a significant name in space exploration as mentioned in the document, with specific missions contributing to its legacy. Here are some of the Pioneer missions and their contributions:

1. Pioneer 0: This was the first spacecraft in the Pioneer series, launched on August 17, 1958, as part of the United States' first attempt to send a satellite beyond Earth's orbit. Although it failed to reach Earth orbit due to a malfunction, it paved the way for future Pioneer missions.

2. Pioneer 10 and 11: These were the first spacecraft to travel through the asteroid belt, conduct close-up studies of Jupiter, and send back images and data from the outer Solar System. Pioneer 10 was launched on March 2, 1972, and became the first spacecraft to achieve escape velocity from the Solar System. Pioneer 11, launched on April 5, 1973, was the first to encounter Saturn and study its rings and moons.

3. Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe: These missions, launched in 1978, studied Venus' atmosphere and weather, providing valuable data about the planet's climate and geological history.

These Pioneer missions played a crucial role in understanding our Solar System, paving the way for future space exploration missions."
What was the impact of President Jimmy Carter's decision to establish as national policy that all U.S. government payloads would fly on the Space Shuttle?,"President Jimmy Carter's decision to establish as national policy that all U.S. government payloads would fly on the Space Shuttle had a significant impact on the space program. This decision secured the Shuttle's future by keeping the flight volume up, allowing greater efficiency, and amortizing fixed costs over more flights. However, the decision also magnified the cost of science missions, which was seen as unnecessary by the space science community. The Shuttle's monopoly was challenged only by the European Ariane expendable launch vehicles, which had limited payload capacity. As the communication satellites grew in size, requiring larger boosters to get to orbit, the Shuttle's ability to carry domestic commercial payloads became increasingly valuable. The first Space Shuttle mission, STS-1, was a success, and NASA went on to build three additional reusable orbiter spacecraft, named after famous exploration sailing ships. The Shuttle's predictable and routine access to space for many people and payloads was seen as the beginning of a new age in space exploration. However, the cost of science missions remained a concern for the space science community.","['50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n98\nfor life was unsuccessful, but the mission yielded tremendous amounts of \ndata, including observations of Martian seasons. Another success was the \nVoyager program, which sent two spacecraft on a “grand tour” of the outer \nplanets. They are still heading into interstellar space.18 Other missions flew \nto Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter. All of these mission successes suggested that \nthe future for space science was bright.\nUnfortunately, Space Shuttle development was absorbing more resources \nthan expected because the Shuttle Main Engine and the heat shield tiles for \nthe Shuttle were proving difficult to develop. These cost overruns were dev\xad\nastating because it was clear, given the economics of the day—hyperinflation \nand economic slowdown—that additional funding was not to be had. NASA \nleadership pursued several angles in order to overcome the funding shortfall. \nAfter some lobbying, President Jimmy Carter was persuaded to establish as \nnational policy that all U.S. government payloads would fly on the Space \nShuttle.19 This decision was seen as securing the Shuttle’s future by keeping \nthe flight volume up, allowing greater efficiency. Fixed costs would be amor\xad\ntized over more flights. In addition, the Shuttle would also carry domestic \ncommercial payloads. The only challenger to the Shuttle’s monopoly was the \nEuropean Ariane expendable launch vehicles. Arianes had limited payload \ncapacity. At the same time, modern communication satellites were grow\xad\ning in size, requiring larger boosters to get to orbit. The impact of Carter’s \ndecision was that all space science payloads would have to be compatible \nwith human missions to and in orbit. This decision magnified the cost of sci\xad\nence missions, a cost seen as unnecessary by the space science community. \nMeanwhile, the U.S. Air Force bitterly resisted any attempt to totally end its \nexpendable launch vehicle (ELV) program. The Air Force wanted to main\xad\ntain control over its access to space, and there was the fear of a single-point \nfailure if the Shuttle fleet was grounded for any reason.\nWith the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan came to office \nwith a mandate to reduce nondefense federal spending. His budget direc\xad\ntor, David Stockman, proposed a significant cut in the NASA budget, $604 \nmillion, effectively reducing it by about 10 percent, meaning all new starts \nwere killed off except for the Galileo mission to Jupiter.20 The following year \n18.\t “Viking Mission to Mars,” http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/viking.html (accessed 23 \nSeptember 2012); “Voyager: The Interstellar Mission,” http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/ (accessed \n23 September 2012).\n19.\t Presidential Directives 37 and 42: https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/research/\npresidential_directives (accessed 8 August 2021).\n20.\t Galileo Legacy Site, http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/ (accessed 23 September 2012).', '63\nCHAPTER 2\u2002 •\u2002 Funding Planetary Science: History And Political Economy \npayloads would fly aboard the Shuttle only if they required astronaut support \nor some other Shuttle capability not available on another launch vehicle. The \nadministration established this requirement for the sake of astronaut safety \nand also to support the development of a U.S. commercial launch indus\xad\ntry. As a result of this policy, NASA would have to add expendable launch \nvehicles to its fleet for robotic space missions, just as the SESAC report had \nrecommended. The policy change represented a confluence of national and \nspace science priorities and had a wide-ranging impact on NASA’s entire \nportfolio of science flight projects.\nStrategic Changes in Advisory Structure\nFollowing the SSEC and SESAC reports, both of which called for NASA to \nimplement an overarching science strategy, NASA’s Office of Space Science \nand Applications (OSSA) introduced a strategic planning process in 1987. \nUnder OSSA Director Lennard Fisk, the office released its first annual stra\xad\ntegic plan in 1988.47 The scientific community embraced the process because \nit provided transparency for NASA’s mission plans, and NASA contractors \nsupported the strategic plan because it enabled them to more effectively \nestablish their own long-term strategies. The plan also provided the scien\xad\ntific community with a more unified voice on programmatic matters, as it \nlaid out the order in which NASA would approve projects. It was clear, then, \nthat completion of one project’s development would allow for the start of the \nnext project in line.\nIn 1989, under Chairman Louis Lanzerotti, the Space Science Board \nchanged its name to the Space Studies Board to reflect an expansion of SSB \nactivities. Prior to the 1990s, the SSB’s reports tended to focus on relatively \nnarrow fields within each of the disciplines in space science. The one excep\xad\ntion was astronomy, for which the board had long issued reports relating \nto the discipline in its entirety.

The policy statement noted that with the end of the Cold \nWar, it was important for the “U.S. to be in a position to capitalize \non foreign technologies—including Russian technologies—without, \nat the same time, becoming dependent on them. The policy allows for \nthe use of foreign components, technologies and (under certain con\xad\nditions) foreign launch services, consistent with U.S. national secu\xad\nrity, foreign policy and commercial space guidelines in the policy.”32 \n•\t Establish policy on Federal agencies’ use of excess U.S. ballistic missile \nassets for space launch, in order to prevent adverse impacts on the U.S. \ncommercial space launch industry. As the statement noted, “The policy \nobliges the government to fully consider commercial services as part \nof the decision-making process and imposes specific criteria on the \nuse of excess assets.”33 \n•\t Provide for an expanded private sector role in the Federal space trans\xad\nportation R&D decision making processes. “In contrast with previous \nnational policy on space transportation, this policy specifically directs \nthe Departments of Transportation and Commerce to identify oppor\xad\ntunities for government-industry cooperation and to factor these into \nNASA’s and DoD’s implementation plans.”34 \nThe directive designated the Department of Defense as lead agency for the \nimprovement and evolution of the U.S. expendable launch vehicle fleet and for \nthe development of the appropriate technology. NASA was assigned responsi\xad\nbility for reusable launch vehicles, including improvement of the Space Shuttle \nsystem, focusing on reliability, safety, and cost effectiveness and, in the longer \nterm, developing the technology and demonstrating the next generation of reus\xad\nable space transportation systems. This included the controversial and technically \nchallenging SSTO concept. NASA was to focus its investments on technologies \nto support a decision no later than December 1996 on whether to proceed \nwith a flight demonstration program, which would, in turn, provide the basis \nfor deciding by the year 2000 whether to proceed with a new launch system to \nreplace the aging Shuttle fleet. In retrospect, these goals were overly ambitious, \ngiven the many other fiscal demands and priorities of the Clinton\xa0administration. \nThe directive assigned the Department of Transportation and the \nDepartment of Commerce the responsibility for identifying and promoting', '103\nCHAPTER 3\u2002 •\u2002 The Politics Of Pure Space Science, The Essential Tension \nthey were gradually lifted in response to commercial pressure for higher-\nresolution imagery. NASA Earth science missions became controversial as \nthey were gradually pulled into the debate over environmental change, espe\xad\ncially questions of climate change. The George H.\xa0W. Bush administration \nsought to build a large-scale program in 1991 called Mission to Planet Earth, \ninvolving flying multiple missions to assess various facets of Earth’s envi\xad\nronment. Pursuing this initiative—“dedicated to understanding the total \nEarth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on the \nglobal environment”33—meant pushing off any need to take a position that \nmight adversely affect the President’s position within the Republican Party \nwhile providing political cover at that year’s United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro.34\nBy 2001, NASA had returned to its former situation of budget overruns \nin the human spaceflight program, and the bow wave had become too large \nto be ignored. The George W. Bush administration reacted by cutting ISS \nfunding again, this time by eliminating a crew return vehicle; canceling the \njoint NASA-DOD X-33 and X-34 next-generation launch vehicle programs; \nand further reducing ISS capabilities. NASA’s ISS partners rejected the lat\xad\nter decision since the reduction would mean that their research modules \nwould never be flown to the ISS and employed for research. Matters came \nto a head on 1 February 2003, when the orbiter Columbia broke up during \nreentry, killing seven crewmembers. The Space Shuttle Program entered its \nfinal stages as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board stated that the \nShuttle was an experimental vehicle whose continued flight was problematic. \nThe Agency was able to restart Shuttle flight in July 2007, but it was now on a \npathway to Shuttle Program shutdown. \nIn January 2004, President George W. Bush announced the Vision for \nSpace Exploration (VSE), a long-term program aimed at returning humans \nto the Moon and ultimately sending people to Mars. A lunar base would \nbecome a test bed for long-duration stays in outer space. NASA stood up a \nConstellation program to develop the Ares 1 expendable launch vehicle and \nthe Orion crew vehicle. Subsequently, a heavy cargo lifter, the Ares 5, would \nbe built to move large quantities of equipment and supplies to Earth orbit for \ndeparture to the Moon and other locations.

Young—who first \nflew in the Gemini program and walked on the Moon during Apollo 16—and \nRobert L. Crippen, who transferred to NASA from the Air Force’s military \nspace program in the early 1970s. For this first flight—and the next three before \nbeing removed—the crew had ejection seats developed for the high-altitude, \nMach 3-plus SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft. Bob Crippen commented that they \nwere “primarily a placebo.” He added, “There was a ton of flame from the solid \nrocket boosters. If you ejected, you would have to go through that and you \nwould get very toasty.”10 \nAfter about 2 minutes, at an altitude of 31 miles, the two boosters were \nspent and separated from the external tank. Waiting ships recovered them \nfor eventual refurbishment and reuse on later missions. The spacecraft’s three \nSpace Shuttle main engines continued to fire for about 8 minutes before shut\xad\nting down just as the orbiter reached space. As they did so, the external tank \nseparated from the orbiter and followed a ballistic trajectory back to the ocean \nbut was not recovered. Columbia reached a velocity on orbit of approximately \n17,322 miles per hour, circling the globe in less than 2 hours. Once in orbit, \nYoung and Crippen tested the spacecraft’s on-board systems, fired the orbital \nmaneuvering system used for changing orbits and the reaction control system \nengines used for attitude control, and opened and closed the payload bay doors. \n(The bay was empty for this first test mission.) \nAfter two days in space testing Columbia, anticipation permeated the nation \nonce again as it landed like an aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, California. \nThe first flight had been a success, and both NASA and the media ballyhooed \nthe beginning of a new age in space exploration, one in which there would \nbe inexpensive and routine access to space for many people and payloads. \nSpeculations abounded that within a few years Shuttle flights would take off\n \nand land as predictably as airplanes and that commercial tickets might be sold \nfor regularly scheduled “spaceline” flights.\nNASA went on to build three additional reusable orbiter spacecraft in \naddition to Columbia. All were named after famous exploration sailing ships. \nColumbia (OV-102) commemorated one of the first U.S. Navy ships to cir\xad\ncumnavigate the globe in 1836.

The impact of President Jimmy Carter's decision was that all space science payloads would have to be compatible with human missions to and in orbit. This decision magnified the cost of science missions, a cost seen as unnecessary by the space science community. Additionally, it secured the Shuttle’s future by keeping the flight volume up, allowing greater efficiency as fixed costs would be amortized over more flights. However, it also led to the U.S. Air Force bitterly resisting any attempt to totally end its expendable launch vehicle (ELV) program, as they wanted to maintain control over their access to space and there was the fear of a single-point failure if the Shuttle fleet was grounded for any reason."
"What were the initial estimates of near-Earth and near-Mars asteroids based on the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, as reported in the document?","In 1979, Glo Helin and Eugene Shoemaker, using the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS), identified five Earth-crossing and seven Mars-crossing asteroids between 1973 and 1978. Of the Earth-crossers, three were ""Aten""-class asteroids whose orbits lay primarily sunward of Earth's, while two were ""Apollo""-class asteroids. (See appendix 2.) Other surveys had found four more Aten and Apollo-class asteroids, bringing the known total to nine. Based on the limiting magnitude of their 46-centimeter Schmidt telescope and using several different statistical methods to extrapolate from this tiny number of asteroids, they arrived at an estimate of 800 ± 300 near-Earth and near-Mars asteroids of these classes. This projection fell within the same order of magnitude as an earlier estimate of Shoemaker's, which had been based on the numbers and ages of large impact craters. (See E. F. Helin and E. M. Shoemaker, ""The Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, 1973–1978,"" Icarus 40, no. 3 (1 December 1979): 321–328, doi:10.1016/0019-1035(79)90021-6.)

In the context of this book, the significance of this estimate is that it was a crucial step in understanding the potential impact hazard posed by near-Earth and near-Mars asteroids. This estimate helped to inform the development of strategies for detecting and deflecting these objects, which has become a major focus of space exploration and planetary defense efforts in recent years.","['A History of Near-Earth Objects Research\n142\ndedicated 1.8-meter telescope, after a good bit of wrangling to get an old mir\xad\nror returned.\nThe advent of many automated asteroid surveys during the mid- to late \n1990s meant an overwhelming flow of new observations into the Minor \nPlanet Center and other data repositories, necessitating transformations in \ntheir processing procedures. But it also meant that each new discovery arrived \nwith some risk that the discovered asteroid would turn out to be a poten\xad\ntial hazard—a “PHA,” or Potentially Hazardous Asteroid—that might col\xad\nlide with Earth in the future. To keep these objects from slipping through \nthe cracks, astronomers also developed automated warning systems to help \nidentify which of the many thousands of newly discovered objects actually \npresented a threat. These were designed to help target additional observations \nto quickly reduce errors in orbit knowledge while also serving as public com\xad\nmunications tools.\nSurvey and Population Modeling\nDeveloping an understanding of what it would take to meet the Spaceguard \ngoal involved modeling the near-Earth object population and evaluating the \nability of various search strategies to find objects of different sizes.

Sky surveys designed to discover asteroids and comets were essen\xad\ntial to advancing those aspects of science. So too were efforts to understand \nwhat small solar system bodies actually were. Early on, astronomers assumed \nthat they were remnants left over from the solar system’s formation, but that \nremained to be proven. And answering that question still left open many others. \nWhat were they made of? Were they rocks? Were they balls of dust and ices? The \neffort to understand the nature of small solar system bodies was known as char\xad\nacterization and employed numerous methods as the 20th century unfolded.\nSurveying for Near-Earth Asteroids in the Age of Photography\nThe first major systematic search for near-Earth asteroids was the Palomar \nPlanet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS) undertaken by Eleanor “Glo” Helin \nand Eugene Shoemaker, both of the California Institute of Technology, in \n1973 using the Palomar Observatory 0.46-meter (18-inch) Schmidt tele\xad\nscope in southern California. It was funded by NASA’s planetary astronomy \nprogram, and the stated goal was to discover and obtain precise orbits for a \nsufficient number of planet-crossing asteroids in order to estimate the popu\xad\nlation of various classes of these objects.1 At the time, Shoemaker believed \n1.\t\nTheir results were summarized in E. F. Helin and E. M. Shoemaker, “The Palomar \nPlanet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, 1973–1978,” Icarus 40, no. 3 (1 December 1979): \n321–328, https://doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(79)90021-6.', 'Chapter 6: Automating Near-Earth Object Astronomy\n143\nThe limiting magnitude of the Palomar Schmidt, which they assessed to \nbe about 18, implied that the asteroids they could see were likely to be quite \nlarge. The size of the asteroids could not be directly determined because the \ntelescope only received reflected light; any given asteroid’s albedo affects the \namount of light it reflects, so an asteroid of a given brightness could be large \nand dark or small and bright. As a practical matter, therefore, size estimates \ndepended upon albedo estimates.3 In their 1979 paper, Helin and Shoemaker \navoided discussion of asteroid size altogether, instead focusing on the likely \npopulations of various classes of asteroids as defined by their orbits.4\nFor his unpublished 1981 report, Shoemaker compiled data for the 57 \nknown near-Earth asteroids, of which 8 also had albedo estimates.5 He also \nidentified eight asteroids that would likely now be referred to as “potentially \nhazardous,” with their orbits passing within 0.02 au of Earth’s orbit. But he \ndidn’t revisit the issue of asteroid populations in the report. He and Carolyn \nShoemaker, with Ruth Wolfe of the USGS, picked up the subject again for \nthe 1988 “Global Catastrophes in Earth History” meeting (aka Snowbird II). \n3.\t\nTelescopic visual brightness estimates of asteroids, called apparent magnitudes, are \nroutinely determined for all well-observed asteroids. Using these estimates, in addition \nto the known asteroid distances from Earth and the Sun as well as the asteroid-centered \nangle between Earth and the Sun (phase angle) at the time of the observations, the \nasteroid’s absolute magnitude can be determined. An asteroid’s absolute magnitude \n(H) is defined as its visual magnitude seen at zero phase and one au from both the \nSun and Earth, and they are available for all well-observed asteroids. If an asteroid’s \ngeometric albedo (pv) or reflectivity is known or assumed, then the object’s diameter \n(D) in kilometers can be expressed in the form D = 1329 pv\n–0.5 10–H/5.

Key issues were the choice of limiting \nmagnitude (which affected telescope design), how much of the sky needed \nto be scanned during each lunation, how often a part of the sky should be \nrescanned, and how many observations would have to be processed each day \nto achieve a real-time survey. Since new discoveries had to be reobserved \nshortly after being detected in order to provide sufficient information for orbit \ndetermination, a useful survey had to have near-real-time data-processing \ncapability to ensure that asteroids would not be “lost” due to lack of follow-\nup observations.\nThis desire for a real-time survey ruled out the kinds of photographic \nsurveys that the Shoemakers, Helin, and some others had been performing \nfor decades.

"Question: What are some of the significant discoveries made by the Spitzer Space Telescope, including the detection of one of the most distant planets ever identified and the discovery of the most remote galaxy ever detected?","The Spitzer Space Telescope has made several significant discoveries, including the detection of one of the most distant planets ever identified, which is about 13,000 light-years from Earth. This planet, known as GN-z11, was detected as part of the Frontiers Field project that combines the power of all three of NASA’s Great Observatories, Spitzer, Hubble, and Chandra. Another significant discovery made by Spitzer was the detection of the most remote galaxy ever detected, which is known as GN-z11. Additionally, the Spitzer Space Telescope's flawed high-resolution camera was repurposed for the EPOCh mission, which aimed to find Earth-size planets circling other stars using transit detection. By measuring variations in a star's brightness, the camera could infer the existence and characteristics of a planet or planets, and even detect previously undiscovered planets and planetary systems.","['229\n2003\u2003\nthat data from the observatory had allowed a more \nprecise measurement of the Hubble constant, the \nrate at which the universe is stretching apart. The \nfollowing year, Spitzer celebrated 10 full years \nof operation in space and continued operation \nof its two instruments which, in August 2014, \nobserved an eruption of dust around a star (NGC \n2547-ID8), possibly caused by a collision of large \nasteroids. Such impacts are thought to lead to the \nformation of planets. Continuing discoveries based \non results from Spitzer (as well as data integrated \nwith information from other space-based observa\xad\ntories such as Swift) were announced in April 2015 \n(discovery of one of the most distant planets ever \nidentified, about 13,000 light-years from Earth) \nand in March 2016 (discovery of the most remote \ngalaxy ever detected, a high-redshift galaxy known \nas GN-z11). The latter was detected as part of the \nFrontiers Field project that combines the power of \nall three of NASA’s Great Observatories, Spitzer, \nHubble, and Chandra. In August 2016, mission \nplanners at JPL announced a new phase of the \nSpitzer mission known simply as “Beyond,” lever\xad\naged on a two-and-a-half-year mission extension \ngranted by NASA earlier in the year. Because the \ndistance between Spitzer and Earth has widened \nover time, during Beyond, its antenna must be \npointed at higher angles towards the Sun to com\xad\nmunicate with Earth.

These \nchallenges will be a part of the Beyond phase as \nSpitzer continues to explore planetary bodies both \nwithin and beyond the solar system. In October \n2017, NASA announced that it was seeking infor\xad\nmation from potential funders who might be able \nto support operation of the telescope after NASA \nfunding runs out in March 2019.

A planet pass\xad\ning in front of a star would dim the star; accordingly, brightness levels, the rate of the \ntransit, and known information about the star, among other data points, could reveal \ninformation about the planet found.

The Spitzer Space Telescope has made several significant discoveries, including:

1. A more precise measurement of the Hubble constant, the rate at which the universe is stretching apart, using data from the observatory.
2. Observation of an eruption of dust around a star (NGC 2547-ID8) in August 2014, possibly caused by a collision of large asteroids, which could lead to the formation of planets.
3. The discovery of one of the most distant planets ever identified, about 13,000 light-years from Earth, in April 2015.
4. The detection of the most remote galaxy ever detected, a high-redshift galaxy known as GN-z11, in March 2016. This discovery was made as part of the Frontiers Field project that combines the power of all three of NASA’s Great Observatories, Spitzer, Hubble, and Chandra.

These discoveries demonstrate the significant contributions of the Spitzer Space Telescope to the field of astronomy and our understanding of the universe."
What is the purpose of the gamma ray spectrometer on the lunar mission and what elements does it map?,"The purpose of the gamma ray spectrometer on the lunar mission is to map the global concentrations of radioactive elements and those that emit gamma rays when hit by cosmic rays or particles in the solar wind. This instrument helps to provide information about the composition of the Moon, including its mineralogy, which can then be compared with the rocks returned by the Apollo missions in the 1960s and ’70s. The measured elements are also key in determining the prevalence of ""KREEP"" and lunar evolution. The mission also emphasizes the detection of resources needed for future construction on the Moon.

In the case of Chang'e 2, the original mission was to repeat the mission of Chang'e 1 with an improved suite of instruments, but additional tasks were attached to CE-2, such that this mission essentially became a pathfinder mission to Chang'e 3, a landing mission. After successfully entering lunar orbit, all of its instruments, activated during the coast to the Moon, continued operations in lunar orbit without problems. CE-2's main lunar orbital mission concluded on 1 April 2012, but because the spacecraft still had a relatively large amount of maneuvering propellant still left, mis­sion planners decided in early 2013 to formulate an extended mission, one that would culminate with a flight to the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange Point. By 25 August 2011, CE-2 completed a second survey of Sinus Iridium from a low altitude and filled in some surface details where earlier data was of relatively low detail. On 8 June 2011, CE-2 raised its apolune to 3,583 kilometers. The next day, CE-2's main engine (50 kgf thrust) fired for 18 minutes, boosting the spacecraft out of lunar orbit. Finally, on 25 August 2011 at 15:24 UT, the 1 kgf thrusters fired to place CE-2 in a 180-day period Lissajous orbit around L2, about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.

A map of the latter set of elements would provide information about the \ncomposition of the Moon, which was known to be composed of 98 percent of these \nelements, by mass. Such maps would show not just the bulk elemental composition \nof the Moon, but also its mineralogy: information on the types of rocks present on \nthe global surface that could then be compared with the rocks returned by the Apollo \nmissions in the 1960s and ’70s. Such measured elements were also key in determin\xad\ning the prevalence of “KREEP”—material rich in potassium (K), rare earth elements \n(REE), and phosphorus (P)—and, therefore, lunar evolution. KREEP may represent \nsome of the last remaining melt after the lunar crust was formed. Together, these \nelements would help scientists understand how the Moon formed and the surface \ncontinued to change. The mission also emphasized the detection of resources needed \nfor future construction on the Moon. Scott Hubbard was the Principal Investigator \nfor this instrument.\nThe neutron spectrometer was built by Bill Feldman and his team at Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory to map the global concentrations of hydrogen, iron, titanium, \ncalcium, aluminum, and other elements on the surface.

The mission’s \nemphasis on resources for future human exploration was promoted again here, as \nradon gas is released with other gases essential for life support.\nThe Doppler gravity experiment, led by Alexander Konopoliv from the Jet Propulsion \nLaboratory, would use the Doppler shift observed in the S-band tracking signal of the \nspacecraft at Earth to estimate the lunar gravity field of the near side of the Moon and \nthe corresponding location and size of any mass anomalies from the surface, lithosphere, \nor internal structure of the Moon.

The team was led by co-investigator Holger Sierks.22\nA Mapping Spectrometer to measure the asteroids’ surface composition was a \nmodification of the VIRTIS mapping spectrometer on Rosetta, which had significant \nheritage from Cassini’s VIMS.23 The instrument combined a visible channel from 0.25 \nto 1.0 micron and an infrared channel from 1 to 5 microns to cover the spectral range \nfrom the near ultraviolet (UV; 0.25 micron) through the near IR (5 microns). Spectral \nresolution at 200 kilometers was 500 meters per pixel, a moderate to high spectral \nresolution. The spectrometer was designed, built, and tested at Galileo Avionica and \nprovided to Dawn by ASI under the direction of Angioletta Coradini of the Instituto \nNazionale Di Astrofisica.24\nThe Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND) would map the abundances of \nmajor elements in rock-forming minerals (oxygen, silicon, iron, titanium, magnesium, \naluminum, and calcium), major elements found in ices (hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen), \nas well as trace element (uranium, thorium, potassium, galodinium, and samarium) \ncomposition. In addition, it would detect neutrons on surface, an indicator of near-\nsurface water. GRaND was built by Bill Feldman, Tom Prettyman, and colleagues at \nthe Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), who brought strong technical heritage \nfrom the Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer on Lunar Prospector and the neutron \nspectrometer on Mars Odyssey.

It was the \nthird mission of NASA’s Discovery Program of low-\ncost, highly-focused, and relatively frequent mis\xad\nsions that were competitively selected. After two \nmid-course corrections, Lunar Prospector entered \norbit around the Moon 105 hours after launch. \nInitial parameters were 92 × 153 kilometers. After \ntwo further corrections on 13 and 15 January, \nthe spacecraft entered its operational 100 × 100-\nkilometer orbit at 90° inclination with a period of \n118 minutes. Perhaps of most interest to scientists \nwas to continue investigations into the signs of \nwater ice on the Moon as found by the Clementine \nprobe. In March 1998, NASA announced that data \nfrom Lunar Prospector suggested the presence of \nwater ice at both the lunar poles; the neutron spec\xad\ntrometer instrument detected hydrogen, assumed \nto be in the form of water. The information indi\xad\ncated that a large amount of water ice, possibly \nas much as 300 million (metric) tons was mixed \ninto the regolith at each pole, the first direct evi\xad\ndence of water ice at the lunar poles. The space\xad\ncraft also detected strong localized magnetic fields, \nmapped the global distribution of major rock types, \nand discovered signs of a 600-kilometer diame\xad\nter, iron-rich core. On 10 December 1998, Lunar \nProspector’s orbit was lowered to 40 kilometers \nto perform high-resolution studies. A subsequent \nmaneuver on 28 January 1999 changed the orbit \nto 15 × 45 kilometers and ended the space probe’s \nprimary mission but began an extended mission \nfor an additional seven months. Lunar Prospector \nwas deliberately impacted onto the shadowed \nShoemaker crater on the lunar surface at 09:52:02 \nUT on 31\xa0July 1999.

Unlike CE-1, CE-2 was launched on a \nmore ambitious direct translunar trajectory (at \n212 × 356,996 kilometers at 28.5° inclination), \nwhich required the more powerful Chang Zheng \n3C launch vehicle. A midcourse correction on \n2\xa0 October 2010 was so accurate that further \nadjustments were unnecessary on the way to the \nMoon. The spacecraft successfully entered lunar \norbit after 4 days and 16 hours of flight (as opposed \nto 12 days for CE-1) at an orbit of 120 × 80,000 \nkilometers. Three adjustments followed on 7, 8, \nand 9 October that resulted in CE-2 being in its \noperational circular orbit at 100 kilometers. All of \nits instruments, activated during the coast to the \nMoon, continued operations in lunar orbit with\xad\nout problems. On 26 October at 13:27 UT, CE-2 \nfired its four 1 kgf thrusters for over 18 minutes to \nbring down perilune to 15 kilometers so that the \nspacecraft could photograph the planned land\xad\ning site of CE-3 in Sinus Iridum. It returned to \nits nominal orbit two days later after obtaining a \nlarge number of high resolution images of the sur\xad\nface, some down to 1.2 to 1.5 meters resolution. In \nFebruary 2012, Chinese authorities released a full \nmap of the Moon at 7 meters resolution, claimed \nat the time as the highest resolution map of the \nMoon. Of all recent probes to the Moon, only the \nphotographs from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter \n(LRO) had higher resolution.

Question: What was the role of the Naval Aircraft Factory in the development of flying boats in the years following World War I?,"In the years following World War I, the Naval Aircraft Factory played a significant role in advancing the design of flying boats and other types of naval aircraft. The factory's engineers focused on developing an all-metal hull for flying boats, which was a significant improvement over the wooden hulls commonly used at the time. This work was not solely for military purposes, as the NACA's annual reports from 1933 to 1940 indicate that commercial potential was also important to and being addressed by the NACA. The Naval Aircraft Factory's efforts in developing flying boats were not limited to military applications, as evidenced by the fact that Ernest G. Stout, who chaired the Naval Aircraft Factory's subcommittee on seaplanes in 1953 and 1955, designed flying boats for Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, a commercial flying boat manufacturer. Overall, the Naval Aircraft Factory's work in developing flying boats was critical to advancing the design of these aircraft and had both military and commercial applications.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n248\nDocument 5-19 (a–c)\n(a) Henry S.

Of these, 8,403 belonged to the Army Air Service \n(of these, 4,865 were based in the United States) and 2,017 belonged to the U.S. \nNavy. Of the Navy airplanes, over half (1,172) were flying boats. In other words, \nflying boats made up over 58 percent of all naval aircraft and over 11 percent of all \nU.S. combat aircraft. With these seaplanes, the Navy patrolled a total of over three \nmillion air miles. Along the way, they attacked 25 German U-boats and sank 12 \nof them.\nIn the years after the war, this naval force quickly dissipated, as did the power \nof the U.S. military establishment generally. By 1925, only 117 flying boats could \nbe counted, mostly obsolete designs from the war such as H-16, HS-2L, and F-5L, \nall built by Curtiss. The one organization that worked energetically through this \nperiod of military retrenchment to advance the design of flying boats and other \ntypes of naval aircraft was the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia. (For a his\xad\ntory of the Naval Aircraft Factory, see William F. Trimble, Wings for the Navy: A \nHistory of the Naval Aircraft Factory, 1917–1956 (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute \nPress, 1990.)

The first document, an Aero Digest article from \n1925, concerns a prototype flying boat developed at the Naval Aircraft Factory \nknown as the PN-9.

Most of these mature flying boats included the same innovative \ntechnology, such as radial air-cooled engines, streamlined nacelles, optimum wing-\nmounted engine locations, variable-pitch propellers, wing flaps, cantilever wings, \nadvanced NACA airfoils, and all-metal (or mostly metal) construction.

In the first document, from August 1943, \nConsolidated Aircraft Corporation’s chief flying boat designer, Ernest G. Stout \n(who would chair the NACA’s Subcommittee on Seaplanes from 1953 to 1955), \nsummarized 10 different proposals for coming up with an effective 180,000-pound \nflying boat. His bottom line: “To attain a marked improvement in flying boat per\xad\nformance it will be necessary to deviate from established conventional design prac\xad\ntice.” A major change in hull form seemed necessary to him, with deeper research \ninto hydrofoils and the type of advanced hulls (e.g., the Ventnor hull) coming into \nuse for hydroplane racing. Stout also recommended looking into the elimination of \nthe propeller and the use of jet propulsion for seaplanes.\nThe second document reports on a conference titled “Trend of Future Design \nin VPB Types,” held at the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics on 4 February 1944. \n(In naval aviation terminology, “VPB” stood for “Patrol Bombing Squadron.”) In \nlooking at the Navy’s present and prospective patrol flying boats, the Bureau rec\xad\nognized, as Stout did in the preceding document, that “[i]t will be necessary to go \nover 100,000 pounds to get a real advance” in flying boat performance. Much of \nthis conference dealt, however, with the Navy’s most immediate need, which was a', '313\nDocument 5-22 (a–h)\nDocument 5-22 (c), Excerpts from Annual Report of the National \nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (Washington, DC, 1933–40). \n“Subcommittee on Seaplanes,” Annual Report (1935), pp. 20–21.\nThe Subcommittee on Seaplanes was organized for the purpose of providing \nspecial consideration for research problems relating to seaplane design, and the \nresearch work conducted in the N.A.C.A. tank is under its direction.\nThe subcommittee held its first meeting at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical \nLaboratory on September 6, 1935, at which a general survey was made of the results \nobtained in the researches in the tank and the investigations at present under way. \nThe future program of research and possible methods of adding to the value of \nthe data obtained in the tank were discussed. In connection with the meeting, an \ninspection was made of the facilities of the tank and methods of making tests and \nof the models used. Motion pictures of the spray and wake characteristics of several \nmodels of floats and hulls were exhibited and a demonstration was made of the \ntowing of a model through the water.\nA statement of the research under way in the tank during the past year is \ngiven\xa0below.\nSeaplanes.—The definite promise of air transport across the Pacific by means of \nflying boats and the belief that, once the trans-Pacific service is established, trans-\nAtlantic service will be developed very rapidly has led to a general increase in the \ninterest in seaplanes and flying boats. The development of very large flying boats, \nof gross loads of 50 to 150 tons, is discussed with confidence. It also appears that \nprivate owners have become more interested in seaplanes as such, while new and \nlarger amphibians are already under test or are being designed.\nA recent development is the appreciation by pilots of the importance of hold\xad\ning the trim of a seaplane that is taking off to the best angles, i.e., the angles that \ngive the least resistance. The N.A.C.A. trim-angle indicator described in Technical \nNote No. 486 has been successfully used by test pilots and improved take-off per\xad\nformances are reported to result from its use. An improved form of the instrument \nis now being designed.\nAmong the advantages derived from the great length of the N.A.C.A. tank is \nthe ability to obtain several sets of readings in the course of a single run of the tow\xad\ning carriage. In order to use this advantage to the full, it was necessary to devise \nwave suppressors that would very quickly reduce the waves produced by a model to \nmagnitudes that would not affect the next run. The wave suppressors now in use \nare described in Technical Note No. 513. They are so effective that test runs may \nsafely be made in immediate succession and all the data for a general test of a model \ncan easily be obtained in 2 days of operation.\nThe design of a model-cutting machine for use in making both wax and \nwooden models has progressed to the point where detailed plans have been started. \nThis machine is designed to cut water lines, buttock lines, and transverse sections', '307\nDocument 5-22 (a–h)\nthe Atlantic in 1919. In the mid-1920s, as head of the design section of the Navy’s \nBureau of Aeronautics’ materiel division, he was one of the Navy leaders working \nhardest to bring about the design of metal flying boats, notably the PN class.\nIn Model Research, historian Alex Roland found it worth noting that the \nNACA populated this particular subcommittee “with government members under \nthe chairmanship of a naval officer.” Roland’s point was that the NACA’s emphasis, \ntypically, was on military applications rather than commercial potential. But one \ncan hardly question the choice of Richardson and Hunsaker to head this subcom\xad\nmittee, given that no one in the United States knew more about seaplanes than \nthese two men. Hunsaker was a formal naval officer, but he had gone on to a \nprestigious career in academe as professor and head of the mechanical engineering \ndepartment at MIT. Moreover, the third chair of the subcommittee, from 1946 to \n1952, was Grover C. Loening, a flying boat manufacturer with many diverse com\xad\nmercial interests. Ernest G. Stout, the next subcommittee chair, from 1953 to 1955, \ndesigned flying boats for Consolidated Aircraft Corporation. Neither Loening or \nStout ever served in the Navy. In the same year Stout started chairing this subcom\xad\nmittee, the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences presented him with its Sylvanus \nAlbert Reed Award “for contributions to the design and development of high-speed, \nwater-based aircraft.” The professional situation of Robert S. Hatcher, who presided \nover the group from 1956 to the end of the NACA in 1958, is not known.\nIt is clear from the following items on seaplanes in the NACA annual reports \nfrom 1933 to 1940 that military applications were critically important but that \ncommercial potential was also important to, and being addressed by, the NACA.\nDocument 5-22 (a), Excerpts from Annual Report of the National \nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (Washington, DC, 1933–40). \n“Seaplanes,” Annual Report (1933), pp. 15–16.\nA description of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics tank, or \nseaplane channel, has been prepared and issued as Technical Report No. 470. \nReference is made in the report to the important items of equipment and the sat\xad\nisfactory behavior of the rubber tires, the towing carriage, and the towing gear. \nThe research program has followed quite closely the program outlined in last year’s \nreport.

The Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia played a significant role in the development of flying boats in the years following World War I. After the war, the naval force quickly dissipated, and by 1925, only 117 flying boats could be counted, mostly obsolete designs from the war. During this period of military retrenchment, the Naval Aircraft Factory worked energetically to advance the design of flying boats and other types of naval aircraft. From its establishment in 1916, the Naval Aircraft Factory worked with particular effort to refine the flying boat, leading to the development of the PN-9 prototype flying boat, which represented the Navy's desire to move toward an all-metal hull."
Question: What is the significance of the International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM) in the context of U.S.-European cooperation in space?,"The International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM) was a joint mission between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) that aimed to explore the Sun's polar regions. However, due to budgetary concerns during the Reagan administration, the shape of the mission changed, and one of the two planned probes was canceled. By the 1980s, ISPM, renamed Ulysses in 1984, had become a single-probe mission. Despite the ""failure"" of cooperation on ISPM, an American-European hybrid OOE mission designed to study the polar regions of the Sun was launched on the Space Shuttle. The transnational approach to the history of Ulysses highlights the changing meanings and imaginings of cooperation and collaboration between various actors and organizations, such as space agencies, politicians, space scientists and engineers, and other advocates. At different times, different individuals saw different values (or perhaps no value at all) in cooperation on an OOE mission. Ulysses is an interesting case study for a transnational analysis as it began as a failed project, the dual-spacecraft ISPM, but eventually a material transnational object, the Ulysses probe, was actually built and launched under a different form of cooperation. The negotiations and lines of cooperation leading to the breakdown of ISPM were a normative representation of cooperation between the two agencies, but a critical mass of issues and concerns led to the cancellation of the U.S. spacecraft. Adopting a transnational perspective might enrich our understanding of international cooperation in space exploration more generally, improving our understanding of the multiple imagined and varied meanings of collaboration constructed by both NASA and ESA.","['50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n286\nbe solved more easily when there is an international community of scientists \nand scholars free to follow common goals and common objectives.”2\nWhile I can only speculate as to whether Lüst was referring to anything \nspecific, it would not be farfetched to think that he might be referencing a \nturbulent episode in NASA-ESA cooperation earlier in the decade, a result \nof the collapse of an agreement between the two agencies for a jointly devel\xad\noped International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM). Although the ISPM was not \nlaunched as originally planned—two solar probes exploring the north and \nsouth poles of the Sun—the plan was eventually reworked and launched in \n1990 as the Ulysses mission. While NASA and ESA eventually carried out a \njoint solar polar mission, with a single spacecraft named Ulysses, the evolu\xad\ntion of ISPM to Ulysses had a lasting impact on U.S.-European cooperation \nin space.3\nThis important episode in the five-decade-long history of international \nspace cooperation also happens to be one of the most strenuous ones. The \nISPM had its origins in the mid-1960s, when European space scientists \nworked on building a scientific constituency for a spacecraft that would \nexplore the Sun out of the ecliptic plane (OOE), particularly at the poles \nand other high latitudes (hence its original designation as an out-of-ecliptic \nmission).4 Through the mid-1970s, NASA and ESA established working \ngroups and hosted a number of symposia and conferences to determine both \nthe scientific and technical merits and capabilities of an out-of-ecliptic mis\xad\nsion. These efforts resulted in a proposal for the ISPM, which was officially \nestablished as a joint mission with the 29 March 1979 signing of a memoran\xad\ndum of understanding (MOU) between NASA and ESA.5 \nTo date, there have been three primary historical studies of Ulysses.

In the late 1970s, NASA had \nproposed a joint venture with the European Space Agency (ESA) called the \nInternational Solar Polar Mission (ISPM). ESA, formed in 1975 to represent \n10 founding Western European nations in space-related activities, became \nthe primary operating organization for the European space science commu\xad\nnity. The member countries of ESA have always funded the organization at \nfar lower levels than NASA’s budget, but ESA has steadily increased its capa\xad\nbilities while cultivating a program of world-class science and technological \ndevelopment. Both the U.S. and European space science communities recog\xad\nnize the potential benefits of international collaboration from a financial and \nintellectual standpoint and so have often pursued cooperative endeavors.\nThe proposed ISPM mission consisted of two spacecraft in polar orbits \naround the Sun, nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. NASA and \nESA were to build one orbiter apiece and launch both by Space Shuttle in \n1983, then use a gravity-assist maneuver to place the spacecraft into their \ncorrect\xa0orbits.\nIn 1982, due to budget restrictions imposed by the Reagan administration \nand rising costs of Shuttle development, NASA canceled its ISPM spacecraft. \nThe two space organizations reworked their agreement so that ESA would \nprovide a single spacecraft for a new solar mission, NASA would provide \na launch vehicle, and both organizations would contribute instruments. \nThis arrangement would allow scientists on both sides of the Atlantic access \nto any data returned by the spacecraft. Although the new mission, named \nUlysses, eventually flew, ESA took umbrage at NASA’s unilateral decision to \ncancel the initial agreement without consultation and adjusted its strategy \nfor future partnerships with NASA.62 This incident would play a significant \nrole in a later joint venture between the two space agencies, the Cassini-\nHuygens mission to Saturn.\nIn a 1983 report, Planetary Exploration Through the Year 2000, the NASA \nAdvisory Council’s Solar System Exploration Committee supported a joint \nmission with ESA to send an orbiter to Saturn along with a probe to land \non one of Saturn’s moons, Titan.63 The mission remained in the concept \n62.\t John Krige, “NASA as an Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy,” in Societal Impact of \nSpaceflight, ed.

In early 1982, ESA sought continued assurance of \nsupport from NASA and Congress.63 ESA also stressed continuing discus\xad\nsions regarding the establishment of a framework for future cooperation—\nthe start of what Johnson-Freese characterizes as a strategy that ultimately \nmade ESA a stronger, autonomous, and more independent space agency.64 In \nJuly 1984, ESA announced the renaming of the ISPM to Ulysses. ESA sug\xad\ngested that the new name was chosen as a reference to the hero in Homer’s \nOdyssey and to Dante’s Inferno. Perhaps the new name also reflected the \nlong, arduous journey of mission development.65 Ulysses was scheduled to be \nlaunched aboard the Space Shuttle on 15 May 1986, but the Challenger acci\xad\ndent of 28 January 1986 intervened.

What is the inherent optimism in early conceptual designs and its effect on cost and schedule growth according to a 2008 study?,"A 2008 study of ten NASA Science Mission Directorate missions found that the average cost growth was 76 percent over programmatic reserves and that the average schedule growth over and above reserves was 26 percent when the final cost was compared to the cost established at the beginning of Phase B. The study did not identify a common root cause of this growth beyond “the inherent optimism in initial concept designs due to competitive pressures,” stating that this optimism could cause underestimation of mass, power, data rate, complexity, and other technical specifications—which then would lead to underestimation of cost.

For general cost performance improvement, it was recom\xad\nmended that NASA hold budget reserves at the program level. The key internal factors for \ncost growth were identified as over-optimism in early formulation and instrument develop\xad\nment complexity, and the external factors were identified as launch and budget instability. \nPractices that improved performance of missions were the presence of ample reserves, best \nproject managers, and best management practices.120\nThe Role of Leadership in Small Missions\nNASA’s Discovery mission line demonstrated in its first two decades that with careful \nplanning, flexible management techniques, and a commitment to cost control, small \nspace science missions could be built and launched at a fraction of the price of strategic \nmissions. Many credit management techniques such as co-location, early contracting \nfor long-lead items, and a resistance to scope creep, but it is also important to examine \nwhat may have been the most significant variable in small mission implementation: \nthe roles and the relationship of the Principal Investigator, who was responsible to \nNASA for the success of the mission, and the project manager, who was responsible \nfor delivering the mission to NASA.\n119 \t\nPerry, R.

Issues resulting \nfrom the management structure compounded the effects of other project issues, \nsuch as overly optimistic heritage or technology assumptions, inadequate project \nschedules, and inadequate planning or replans. The management structure issues \nwere exacerbated by project team member inexperience.\n8. \tTeam players with limited experience in planetary mission development were a \nsignificant contributor to project management issues resulting in cost over-runs. \nProject team inexperience was a direct factor in only two of the missions studied, \nhowever it also contributed to other problems cited within this study.\n9. \tMany of the technical and project management drivers for LCC escapes were iden\xad\ntified as issues (weaknesses, risks, concerns, or findings) during one or more of \nthe mandated NASA project reviews, but there was insufficient follow-through to \naddress (mitigate or refute) the panel’s conclusions and recommendations.\nThe study also made three observations:\n1.\tThe collection, analysis, and synthesis of the study data was much more intensive \nthan anticipated, primarily due to the lack of official, formal program and project \nhistorical documentation.\n2.\tThe D&NF programs, as well as NASA as a whole, need to address the credibility \nof project cost estimates, including independent cost evaluations.\n3.\tThe majority of the underlying causes are embedded in the project approach during \nthe concept study (Phase A) and preliminary design (Phase B) phases, but the actual \ncost or schedule impacts typically are not experienced until late in the development \nor operations phases (Phases D and E).114\nThe most surprising result was that none of these findings were new. All the find\xad\nings had been reported over the years as project management and systems engineering \nissues; good project management and systems engineering practices had been iden\xad\n114 \t\nLife Cycle Cost Growth Study for the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office—Final \nReport 2010.', 'Chapter 4: Applying Lessons Learned\n157\nment plus testing, and Steve [Wissler, the mission operation systems engineer] had \nthe most work to do.”64 That was yet another consequence of the mission’s budgetary \nissues. It wouldn’t be the last.\nExtreme Optimism\nOver the course of the project, costs had increased for reasons beyond the techni\xad\ncal. As Bill Blume, the mission design lead, put it: “Deep Impact was proposed in \nthe Faster, Better, Cheaper environment, and the first proposal went out—the Step\xa01 \nproposal in 98 and the Step Two in 99—and Deep Impact was accepted just months \nbefore the Mars ’98 failures…. People were making cost estimates with just extreme \noptimism, and there’s a competitive nature in the proposal process that just makes \nyou optimistic.”65\nMoreover, public failures unrelated to Deep Impact suddenly became Deep Impact’s \nproblem. As Wissler explained, “The rules kept changing out from under us. Every time \nthere would be a mission failure or something, we would be held to a higher standard \nthan what had been costed originally.”66\nThis manifested at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the form of new sets of stringent, \nconservative, structured approaches to spacecraft development called Flight Project \nPractices and Design Principles. After the twin embarrassments of two consecutive \nMars failures, the lab was tightening screws, and no one was exempt.\nThe lab’s new guidelines meant a stringent, independent verification and validation \nreview process on the hardware, software, processes, and subsystems to certify the \nspacecraft as ready for launch. It felt invasive to Deep Impact’s leadership. No previ\xad\nous project had faced such scrutiny, and budget increases did not accompany the new \nexpensive reviews and processes.\nAlready overworked in the runup to launch, with the added stressors of verifica\xad\ntion and validation processes, the handoff from the integration and testing team to the \nmission operations team “was really a shaky process,” recalled Wissler.67 Losing that \nyear meant losing precious time in space to do spacecraft and instrument calibrations.\nHaving only six months from launch to encounter made the cruise phase a crucible. \nThe team had to work out bugs in everything from “fault protection” mechanisms in \nthe spacecraft to navigation. The High-Resolution Instrument, for example—one of \nthe largest experiments ever built for a planetary science mission, and essential to mis\xad\nsion success—failed to yield “perfect focus.” Initial images were blurry, but a routine \n“bake out” of residual moisture accumulated during launch should have sharpened \n64 \t\nIbid.\n65 \t\nIbid.\n66 \t\nIbid.\n67 \t\nIbid.']","
A 2008 study found that inherent optimism in early conceptual designs due to competitive pressures can cause underestimation of mass, power, data rate, complexity, and other technical specifications, which then leads to underestimation of cost. This underestimation, coupled with success-oriented schedules implemented to meet a launch window, control overall costs, and/or to obtain science quickly, can result in cost and schedule growth. The study found that the average cost growth was 76 percent over programmatic reserves and the average schedule growth was 26 percent when the final cost was compared to the cost established at the beginning of Phase B. The study was later expanded to 20 missions, which showed overall life-cycle growth of 37 percent in mass, 41 percent in power, 56 percent in cost, and 38 percent in schedule. Discovery missions included in the study were Genesis and Deep Impact."
"What was the significance of the Cassini-Huygens mission in the history of solar system exploration, and what were the main steps of its journey towards Titan?","The Cassini-Huygens mission was a joint endeavor of NASA, ESA, and ASI, which consisted of a sophisticated spacecraft performing multiple orbital tours around Saturn and a probe that was released from the main spacecraft to parachute through the atmosphere to the surface of Saturn's largest and most interesting moon, Titan. The mission's name honors two 17th-century astronomers who pioneered modern observations of Saturn and its satellites. The scientific background and technical aspects of the mission are discussed in various sources, including D. M. Harland's Cassini at Saturn and M. Meltzer's The Cassini-Huygens Visit to Saturn: An Historic Mission to the Ringed Planet. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission was significant in the history of solar system exploration because it was the most ambitious effort in this field ever mounted. It was the first European mission devoted to solar system exploration, and Huygens, in fact, was the first European mission to enter the ESA selection process on equal conditions with other proposals, supported by a large and motivated scientific constituency. The mission's journey towards Titan involved the sophisticated spacecraft performing multiple orbital tours around Saturn, and the probe, named after Christiaan Huygens, being released from the main spacecraft to parachute through the atmosphere to the surface of Titan. The probe completed its mission on the very day of its descent through Titan's atmosphere, on 14 January 2005, while the nominal mission of the Cassini orbiter came to an end on 30 June 2008, four years after the spacecraft entered orbit around Saturn. NASA, however, approved two extensions of the mission, the last of which ran to 15 September 2017.","['50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n238\nwhole Cassini program, including the Huygens probe and the antenna \nunder development in Italy, should undergo an independent review by a \nteam of external experts.

After some tense meetings, ESA \neventually accepted the review, which turned out to be a positive experience \nbecause ESA’s contribution survived it and because it created confidence and \nstrengthened cooperative spirit.\nCONCLUSION\nFollowing the 1994 political crisis and the 1995 review, the Cassini program \nwent on smoothly. The Huygens probe was integrated and tested at Dornier’s \nfacilities in Ottobrunn near Munich, and in April 1997 it was shipped to \nNASA’s Kennedy Space Center to be fitted to the main spacecraft. The \nCassini-Huygens mission was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral \non 15 October 1997. About 500 representatives of the scientific, engineering, \nand industrial teams in Europe that had created the Huygens probe attended \nthe launch. After a seven-year cruise, Cassini entered orbit around Saturn on \n1 July 2004. Six months later, on 25 December, Huygens was released by the \nmother spacecraft and started its 20-day, 4-million-kilometer cruise toward \nTitan. According to the mission scenario, a sequence of parachutes would \ndeploy to slow it down, and its scientific instruments would be exposed to \nTitan’s atmosphere during descent. If the probe survived impact with the \nsurface, its instruments would be expected to continue to operate, providing \nadditional information for a time ranging from a few minutes to half an hour \nor more. Out in space, Cassini would pick up Huygens’s signals, then turn its \nantenna toward Earth, and relay the recorded scientific data. \nOn Friday, 14 January 2005, a group of nervous and excited scientists \ngathered in the control room of the European Space Operations Centre \n(ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, to observe this epochal event in the his\xad\ntory of solar system exploration and enjoy the crowning achievement of their \ncareers. For the first time since the beginning of the Space Age, a human \nartifact would be landed on another world in the outer solar system. The \nscientists and their distinguished guests, including ministers, space agency \nofficials, and journalists, were waiting. Around noon, the news arrived that \na faint radio signal from the probe had been picked up by the Green Bank \nradio telescope in West Virginia. Huygens had then survived the entry phase \nand was active! Late in the afternoon, the first scientific data, relayed by the \nCassini spacecraft, arrived at ESOC. Scientists hurried to analyze the data, \nand soon the press got the first stunning images of Titan’s surface.

Since Huygens, ESA has landed its Philae probe on the \ncomet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (November 2014) and the Japan Aerospace \nExploration Agency (JAXA) has landed its Hayabusa probe on the asteroid \nItokawa (September 2005). \nThe Cassini-Huygens collaboration was, at times, “fraught with difficul\xad\nties,” as Russo explains. Nonetheless, the partners overcame them. Both \nCassini (which ended its mission in 2017) and Huygens (which completed its \nmission on the day that it landed) are success stories that mark an important \nstep forward in NASA-ESA collaboration.', '50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n226\nThe 12 scientific instruments on the orbiter were designed for in-depth \nstudies of the planet, its rings, its atmosphere, its magnetic environment, \nand a large number of its moons. The six instruments on the probe provided \ndirect sampling of Titan’s atmospheric chemistry and images of its surface. \nNASA provided the orbiter, ESA provided the probe, and ASI provided the \nhigh-gain antenna and other hardware systems for the orbiter. The scientific \ninstruments and related investigations were realized by scientific teams in \nthe United States and in ESA’s member states.

It was only in the mid-1980s that an ambitious \nEuropean planetary mission was considered as a realistic possibility, follow\xad\ning ESA’s successful Giotto mission to Comet Halley (1985–86).

These ideas and concepts are then discussed by \nexpert groups and advisory committees in a competitive selection procedure \nconcluding with the approval of one mission. The final decision to adopt a \nscientific mission in ESA’s program is thus the outcome of a highly competi\xad\ntive process, involving the various national and disciplinary sectors of the \nspace science community, the ESA executive staff, the European space indus\xad\ntry, space policies in ESA’s member states, relations with NASA and other \npotential international partners, etc.3 The selection process of the Huygens \nmission is not particularly different from previous ones regarding general \nmethodology, but this mission is the first planetary mission that entered the \nESA selection process on equal conditions with other proposals, supported \nby a large and motivated scientific constituency. \nFinally, the ESA-NASA relationship in the development of the Cassini-\nHuygens project is the third focus of my analysis.

The Cassini-Huygens mission was a significant event in the history of solar system exploration as it marked the first time a human artifact was landed on another world in the outer solar system. The mission's primary objective was to study Saturn, its rings, and its moons, particularly Titan.

The main steps of the Cassini-Huygens mission towards Titan were as follows:

1. The Cassini spacecraft and the Huygens probe were developed independently by NASA and ESA, respectively.
2. Following a political crisis and a review in 1994 and 1995, the Cassini program, including the Huygens probe and the antenna under development in Italy, underwent an independent review by a team of external experts.
3. The Huygens probe was integrated and tested at Dornier's facilities in Ottobrunn near Munich.
4. In April 1997, the Huygens probe was shipped to NASA's Kennedy Space Center to be fitted to the main spacecraft.
5. The Cassini-Huygens mission was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on 15 October 1997.
6. After a seven-year cruise, Cassini entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004.
7. Six months later, on 25 December, Huygens was released by the mother spacecraft and started its 20-day, 4-million-kilometer cruise toward Titan.
8. A sequence of parachutes deployed to slow down the Huygens probe during its descent towards Titan's atmosphere.
9. If the probe survived impact with the surface, its instruments were expected to continue to operate, providing additional information for a time ranging from a few minutes to half an hour or more.
10. Out in space, Cassini picked up Huygens’s signals, then turned its antenna toward Earth, and relayed the recorded scientific data.

On 14 January 2005, the Huygens probe successfully landed on Titan, and the first scientific data and images of Titan's surface were relayed back to Earth by the Cassini spacecraft."
What are the four types of helicopters shown in the figure and what are their unique features?,"The figure in question is not provided in the given text. However, based on the text, the four types of helicopters mentioned are:

1. De Bothezat helicopter: This helicopter had four lifting propellers, two of which were rotated at each side of the pilot and facing forward to give a forward thrust. The control was secured by making all the lifting propellers variable and reversible in pitch, and by using the two small variable-pitch directional propellers with axes horizontal, placed on either side of the fuselage.

2. Oehmichen Helicopter: This helicopter had four main rotors and several lateral stabilizing propellers. The main structure was in the form of a large cross with unequal arms. The longer axis was the longitudinal one and defined the direction of forward flight. At the four terminals of the arms of the cross were placed the lifting propellers. The longitudinal pair of lifting propellers were 25 ft. in diameter and the lateral pair were 21 ft. in diameter, all turning at 145 R.P.M. and driven by a system of tubular shafting from a Le Rhone 9-cylinder engine of 120 HP. The engine was placed at the center of the cross, and on the engine shaft was placed a gyroscope (apparently nothing but a flywheel), which had a maximum peripheral velocity of 425 ft. per sec. This rotating mass was said to insure stability in calm air, and to damp out oscillations in rough air. Two propulsive propellers, of fixed pitch, were belt-driven and placed as shown in Fig. 14. These were of 4.6 ft. diameter and placed about half-way out on the frames which supported the lifting propellers. To counteract the torque of the engine and the gyroscope, a propeller with its axis horizontal and athwartship was placed far forward. In addition, five auxiliary propellers, “evolueurs” as Oehmichen terms them, were used. These were variable-pitch propellers of 4.75 ft. diameter, driven from the shafts of the main lifting propellers. It is quite evident that the control about every axis was fully provided for. The landing gear consisted of a peculiar system of six footballs at the","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n520\nOehmichen Helicopter. This is a very \ncurious machine.

The landing gear consists of \na peculiar system of six footballs at the end of shock-absorbing and pivoted struts. \nA double skid has been recently introduced into the forward part of the machine. \nThe gross weight of the machine is about 2200 lb., with a load of 6.6 lb. per sq. ft. \nof blade area.Diagram of an Oehimichicen Helicopter with 4 main rotors and several lateral stabilizing propellers\nFIG. 14.

Its development continues and, at present, \nthere appears to be no limit to further improvement and increased lifting\xa0capacity.\nBesides other qualities, a good helicopter must possess two characteristics that \ngreatly contribute to its usefulness and universality.\nOne is to have such flight and control characteristics as to permit the use of a \nhoist with a cable and sling or rescue basket or, in larger aircraft, any type of van \nthat can carry passengers or cargo. Such arrangements make it possible to deposit or \npick up passengers or materials to and from any spot where even a helicopter cannot \nland. Besides countless services made possible by this arrangement, thousands of \nlives were saved in emergencies because it was possible to pick up victims from trees \nand rooftops, small boats and other places and, when necessary, hoist them into the \ncabin of the helicopter.\nThe second feature is the ability of a good helicopter to make, whenever neces\xad\nsary, a so-called partial landing. This is a maneuver where the pilot gently places the \nwheels, or sometimes only one wheel, of the helicopter on the ground, or on the slope \nof a hill, a rooftop or any other place where even the helicopter is not able to land, \nand, thus, makes it possible for the passengers to either enter or leave the\xa0aircraft.\nThis feature allows for other landing opportunities. There are a number of \nplaces, such as flat rooftops, which are large enough and appear to be good landing \nspots but which are not strong enough to bear the full weight of a helicopter. In \nthis case the pilot can make a partial landing by gently placing a small portion of \nthe weight on the wheels and supporting the bulk of the weight through the rotor \nblades. This maneuver has been practiced in many cases. One particular example, \nwhich will be described in more detail later, was the rescue operation at the Brussels \nAir Terminal fire.\nVery valuable characteristics can be expected from an amphibian helicopter. \nAircraft of this type have already been produced, and further progress along this \nline can be expected in the future. The amphibian helicopter may be considered the \nmost universal vehicle ever devised by man. The truth of this somewhat extrava\xad\ngant statement is evident. Steamships and boats are limited to adequate waterways; \ntrains can travel only over rails, automobiles only over roads, and even tanks and \ntractors are limited by swamps, deep snow, steep hills, rivers, seas, forests, and so \non. Airplanes obviously can fly freely through the air in any direction, but they \nare helpless and useless without adequate airports for takeoffs and landings. Only \nthe helicopter is independent, requiring but a little free space on the ground or a \nplatform where it can swing its rotors. The amphibian helicopter, in addition to \nits ability to land on the ground, also can land on water, deep snow or swamp. It \ncan even land with complete safety on thin ice because, if the ice should break, the \nmachine will remain afloat and the pilot can start it up again, hop off and seek \nanother landing spot.\nConcluding this review, I can only reaffirm my belief that the classic helicop\xad\nter is here to stay; further development of direct-lift aircraft will continue. I am', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n518\nThe engine drives a main shaft and four jackshafts, to each of which is con\xad\nnected a turret driven through ring and center gearing. The engine also drives two \n4-bladed propellers, of the reversible-pitch type, one being rotated at each side of \nthe pilot and facing forward so as to give a forward thrust.\nUnofficial reports indicate that the De Bothezat helicopter was moderately sat\xad\nisfactory in control and stability. In the four-man flight mentioned above, a man was \nhanging on at the extreme end of the rear arm with his weight totally\xa0unbalanced.\nWe have discussed in the previous section the utility of the dihedral principle. \nThis principle was undoubtedly used successfully here; with the planes of rota\xad\ntion of the laterally and longitudinally disposed airscrew at a dihedral angle to \none\xa0another.\nThe control secured was apparently complete by making all the lifting pro\xad\npellers variable and reversible in pitch, and by using the two small variable-pitch \ndirectional propellers, with axes horizontal, placed on either side of the fuselage.\nIn order to reverse the pitch of the blades of the main lifting screws a hollow \nshaft is fixed to the frame, and the end extends upward to a floating bearing which \nacts as a hub for a hollow shaft. A reversing and adjusting sleeve and levers are \nadapted to be operated vertically by movement of the shaft mounted within the \nadjusting sleeve in order to adjust the blade angle. The shaft is vertically operated \nby means of spiral threads and a spiral-threaded member, the threads being oper\xad\nated by a sprocket to set the pitch of all the propellers’ members simultaneously in \nthe same direction, and the threaded member which is operated by a lever for lateral \nstability by relative variation of the blades of the opposite lifting screws.\nForward motion was apparently secured by tipping the helicopter forward. \nWith the variable pitch of the four airscrews, lateral as well as longitudinal control \nwas secured. The possibility of tipping the helicopter in any sense permits its dis\xad\nplacement being effected in any direction.\nWhile no attempts were made to land the helicopter with its engine cut, the \ndesign provided for reversing the blades on descent and securing windmill resis\xad\ntance, and also for a reversal to normal position just before reaching the ground.\nDamblanc Helicopter.

There is now good \nevidence that each major VTOL type may be expected to engender its own unique \napplications and create its own sphere of usefulness, just as the helicopter has done.\nMeanwhile the helicopter continues to expand its markets, both commercial \nand military, as its performance and operating costs continue to improve. It is sig\xad\nnificant that most of the new helicopter applications of recent years have empha\xad\nsized the low-speed performance characteristics of the helicopter. Commercially, \nfor example, helicopters are now being used for mineral exploration work in all \ntypes of terrain, and for mapping and route surveys in rugged inaccessible areas. \nMilitarily, helicopters are finding new uses as aerial cranes, in naval minesweeping, \nand as aerial weapon platforms.\nAt the other end of the VTOL spectrum, experimental jet aircraft have recently \nmade successful initial flights, and operational versions may reasonably be expected \nwithin the next five years. For the foreseeable future, the application of the jet \nVTOL type with its short hovering endurance will probably be exclusively military \nin nature, with its most likely use being as an interceptor aircraft.\nBetween the helicopter and the jet lies a considerable portion of the VTOL spec\xad\ntrum, available for occupancy by aircraft types with hovering abilities and speed capa\xad\nbilities between the helicopter and jet extremes. Probably the candidate most likely to \nbe successful in making a place for itself in the intermediate portion of the spectrum \nis a general type which is termed the convertiplane for purposes of this paper.\nTHE CONVERTIPLANE\nBy the term convertiplane is meant a type of aircraft which uses one or more \nrotating airfoil systems acting on unheated atmospheric air to provide lift for verti\xad\ncal and low-speed flight, and to provide forward thrust for high-speed flight with \nthe lift load transferred to a monoplane wing. The rotating-airfoil system, which \nmay be a rotor-propeller, a conventional propeller, or a ducted propeller, has its axis \nsubstantially vertical for low speed flight, and converts to high-speed flight configu\xad\nration by having its axis rotated forward to a generally horizontal attitude.\nFig. 1 [not reproduced] shows one type of convertiplane, the Bell XV-3. It has \nrelatively lightly loaded rotor-propellers which are mounted in journals at the wing \ntip for conversion. The wing is fixed to the fuselage at the incidence for forward \nflight at all times. This type has often been called the tilt-rotor convertiplane, but \na more definitive term might be: fixed-wing convertiplane.\nFig. 2 [not reproduced] shows a second type of convertiplane, the Vertol Model \n76. In this case, the rotor-propellers are smaller in diameter and of higher solidity, and \nare mounted at about the mid-span position on each wing. The wing chord line is no \nlonger fixed with respect to the fuselage, but rotates about a spanwise axis with the \nrotor-propellers during conversion. This type is known as a tilt-wing convertiplane.', 'Chapter 5: Other Paths, Other Flyways\n5\n“helicopter war.” Not only did millions of TV viewers regularly see on the nightly \nnews how helicopter gunships served as taxicabs for war correspondents, but they \nsaw them armed with rockets and multi-barrel machine guns and providing close \nsupport to ground troops. The public saw helicopters flying medical-evacuation \nand search-and-rescue missions—and even though they did not see them doing \nit, they knew that helicopters were also carrying out clandestine missions behind \nenemy lines. Between 1962 and 1973, the United States armed forces fighting in \nSoutheast Asia lost a total of 4,870 helicopters in either combat or noncombat \noperations. Nearly 2,200 American helicopter pilots lost their lives or were reported \nas missing in action. The sound of “choppers coming in” became both the audio \nand visual icon of the Vietnam experience. Director Francis Ford Coppola used the \nsound, fury, and moral ambiguity of the helicopter in powerful ways in his 1979 \nfilm Apocalypse Now. So vital was the helicopter to live theater’s Miss Saigon and its \ntragic opera of evacuating the American embassy in April 1975 that its producers \nwent to the trouble of building a full-scale mockup of a helicopter gunship and \n“flying” it onto the stage for every single performance.\nReaders might wonder about the efficacy of combining the history of all three \nof these types of aircraft into a single chapter; so did we. Each type’s development \non its own is difficult enough to follow, with its own complexities and fascinations. \nAerodynamically, each type posed very different problems. But the broader themes \nimbedded in the Küchemann quotation that begins this chapter justify the trio \ncombination. Aerodynamics has never been all about airplanes. From the start, \nit has involved other principal means of mechanical flight. Most notable among \nthese have been the airship (and the balloon before it), the flying boat, and differ\xad\nent forms of rotary-wing aircraft, as well as the missile or rocket (not dealt with in \nthis chapter). For all these flight vehicles, the same laws of nature, the same phys\xad\nics, and the same basic aerodynamic principles applied. But each type of vehicle \nfeatured its own potentialities for flight, offered its own opportunities for growth \nand development, and posed its own unique problems of design, fabrication, and \noperation. This distinctiveness led to the emergence of dedicated specialists devoted \nto the progress of each type of machine. To a great extent, aerodynamic knowledge \ntranslated in all directions between these groups, with each enriching the others \nwith new ideas, findings, theories, inventions, and processes that contributed to \nthe progress of aerodynamics generally. But committed belief in different forms of \naircraft also led to social, professional, and economic groupings that competed for \nattention, missions, resources, passengers, and center stage. The dynamics of these \ngroupings and their interrelationships undoubtedly helped lead to the conformity \nand lack of vision that Küchemann lamented. The essay and documents to follow \ndeal with the many complexities of historical development related to the aerody\xad\nnamics of airships, flying boats, and rotary-wing aircraft. In doing so, this chapter \nshould offer at least hints and suggestions about the many issues relevant to deter\xad\nmining how to define—and not define—aeronautical progress.']","

Question: What is the role of Spacewatch in the Spaceguard survey network and what are some of its achievements?,"The Spacewatch program, led by Tom Gehrels, played a significant role in the Spaceguard survey network. The Spaceguard committee recommended a survey system based upon the Spacewatch 2,048- by 2,048-pixel sensor with faster readout and data-processing capabilities and seven telescopes 2 meters in diameter, with four detectors each. However, when the NASA Near-Earth Objects Observations Program was established in 1998, it funded renovations to existing telescopes to enable reaching the Spaceguard goal. Automating surveys was a crucial aspect of the Spaceguard survey network, and Tom Gehrels had long sought to create a dedicated facility for assessing the true population of near-Earth asteroids. The first Spacewatch camera was designed and built by Jack Frecker, and it used an RCA 320- by 512-pixel CCD as its detector with a coffee can loaded with dry ice to keep the detector cold. It was built quickly, seeing “first light” in May 1983. The camera’s first targets were parts of the sky with known asteroids, as a means of demonstrating that the complex new system actually worked. The asteroids were promptly found in the computer processing of the data; it was probably the first time in history that an asteroid was found with a CCD system.","['141\nCHAPTER 6\nAUTOMATING NEAR-EARTH \nOBJECT ASTRONOMY\nR\necognition that near-Earth asteroids and comets represented a new kind \nof environmental risk led to the establishment of NASA’s Near-Earth \nObject Program Office at JPL in 1998, providing a locus of quantitative risk \nassessment. An important aspect of that task was the need to refine knowl\xad\nedge about the numbers and sizes of actual asteroids. The Spaceguard goal of \nfinding 90\xa0percent of the 1-kilometer- or larger-diameter asteroids had been \nbased upon modeling that relied upon a very small sample size—only 128 \nEarth-crossing asteroids were known when the Spaceguard Survey report was \npublished, and only 61 of those had well-established orbits.1 This small sample \nsize meant a large uncertainty, which could be reduced only by finding a \nlarger fraction of the real population.\nThe obvious solution to the challenge of finding a large fraction of the near-\nEarth object population was automated discovery surveys, similar to the work \nthat Tom Gehrels’s Spacewatch was already starting to do. The Spaceguard \nSurvey committee had recommended a “survey network” of six 2.5-meter \ntelescopes designed to cover about 6,000 square degrees of sky per month. \nWhile that network was never built, during the 1990s, other automated sur\xad\nveys were developed in its place. Two would use U.S. Air Force telescopes \nbuilt for tracking satellites; two others would be built around older telescopes \nthat had fallen into disuse. And Gehrels’s Spacewatch would finally build its \n1.\t\nDavid Morrison, ed., “The Spaceguard Survey: Report of the NASA International \nNear-Earth-Object Detection Workshop” (Moffett Field, CA: NASA Ames Research \nCenter, 1992), http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19920025001 (accessed 8 March 2021), \np. 15.', 'Chapter 6: Automating Near-Earth Object Astronomy\n145\nof adequate data reduction and follow-up.”7 Early in their ideal survey, they \nanticipated that thousands of objects would be seen every lunation, with about \none thousand of those turning out to be new Earth-crossing asteroids.\nThe two first explored an idealized “whole sky” survey, in which the entire \nsky was surveyed monthly. In reality, this was impossible to achieve in a single \nlunation because the Moon brightens the sky too much to find faint asteroids \nand comets over part of the month, but simulating it nevertheless proved a \nuseful exercise to help them understand all of the constraints on a real survey. \nAt the limiting magnitude of the Palomar 46-centimeter Schmidt that the \nShoemakers and Helin had been using, even a 25-year-long whole-sky survey \nwould not find even half of the Earth-crossing asteroids larger than 1 kilome\xad\nter in diameter. At a limiting magnitude of 20, slightly worse than that of the \nSpacewatch 0.9-meter telescope, a 25-year survey would find around 70\xa0per\xad\ncent of the 1-kilometer or larger objects. Higher limiting magnitudes were \nclearly beneficial; at 22nd magnitude, a survey system could reach 90\xa0percent \ncompletion in five years.8 This high yield occurs because the more light a \ntelescope can collect, the farther away it can see any given asteroid. In other \nwords, fainter performance meant peering farther into space, increasing the \nvolume of space being scanned.\nThe Spacewatch telescope itself would not be able to achieve these results, \nhowever, as the drift scan technique severely limited the amount of sky it could \naccess during the dark time of each month. That technique, of course, had \nbeen developed to overcome the slow readout of the telescope’s detector. The \nsimulations Bowell and Muinonen performed showed that a survey system \nmore efficient than the Spacewatch 0.9-meter telescope would be needed to \nscan the entire dark sky monthly to discover all of the 1-kilometer-class Earth-\ncrossing asteroids within 25 years. Such a survey still would not discover all \nthe Earth-crossing comets because long-period comets (by definition, with \norbit periods greater than 200 years) would not necessarily be visible from \nEarth during such a “short” survey period. The long-period comets would \nrequire surveillance in perpetuity. But comets aside, it was now possible to \nassess the risk from asteroids in a reasonable period of time.\n7.\t\nEdward Bowell and Karri Muinonen, “Earth-Crossing Asteroids and Comets: \nGroundbased Search Strategies,” in Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids, ed.

Fewer, larger telescopes could be substi\xad\ntuted, but they needed to be distributed between both hemispheres.9 A coor\xad\ndination center would be necessary to assure monthly sky coverage, and of \ncourse it would need some sort of data system. They expected this Spaceguard \nSurvey system to cost about $50 million to build and $10 to $15 million per \nyear to operate.10\nNothing like the Spaceguard Survey system would actually be built. \nInstead, when the NASA Near-Earth Objects Observations Program was \nestablished in 1998, it funded renovations to existing telescopes to enable \nreaching the Spaceguard goal.\nAutomating Surveys\nTom Gehrels had long sought to create a dedicated facility for assessing the \ntrue population of near-Earth asteroids.

He still intended to build a larger, dedicated 1.8-meter telescope on \nKitt Peak in Arizona. He even had a mirror for it—at least, he had the prom\xad\nise of one. During the 1960s, the U.S. Air Force had built several lightweight \nmirrors for a project known as the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, which was \nintended to be, in essence, a crewed surveillance satellite.11 But the program \nwas canceled in 1969.

So while the phase A study \nresulted in a completed conceptual design for the facility, what NASA ulti\xad\nmately funded was just the CCD-based camera and its data-processing system. \nThe camera was designed to be mounted on an existing 0.9-meter Newtonian \ntelescope at Kitt Peak.

This arrangement was less problematic than it might \nseem, as the radial velocity experiment needed bright stars and could observe \nduring the part of the month astronomers call “bright time,” the two weeks \nsurrounding the full Moon, while the Spacewatch camera needed the “dark \ntime” surrounding the new Moon to hunt for much dimmer asteroids.17\nThe first Spacewatch camera was designed and built by Jack Frecker, who \nhad also designed Gehrels’s balloon-based precursor to his polarimeters on \nPioneers 10 and 11, the Polariscope.

Spacewatch is a part of the Spaceguard survey network, which is a group of telescopes and observatories that search for near-Earth objects (NEOs). The primary goal of the Spaceguard survey network is to discover and track NEOs to determine if any of them pose a threat to Earth. Spacewatch has made significant contributions to this effort by discovering and tracking numerous NEOs since its inception in the late 1980s.

Spacewatch is located at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and uses a 0.9-meter telescope and a 1.8-meter telescope to search for NEOs. The observatory has discovered over 1,500 asteroids and comets, including the asteroid 1997 XF11, which was initially thought to have a small chance of impacting Earth. Spacewatch was also instrumental in confirming the impact of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet with Jupiter in 1994.

The Spacewatch team has developed innovative techniques for detecting and tracking NEOs, including the use of automated discovery algorithms and drift scanning techniques. The observatory has also played a role in the Spaceguard Survey report, which outlines the goals and achievements of the Spaceguard survey network.

In summary, Spacewatch is a key component of the Spaceguard survey network and has made significant contributions to the discovery and tracking of NEOs. Its achievements include the discovery of over 1,500 asteroids and comets and the development of innovative techniques for detecting and tracking NEOs."

Of these projects, six of the missions \n(38 percent) resulted in some sort of failure.12\nThe extent to which the “faster, better, cheaper” initiative impacted the \nabove failures is debatable. Many critics of the initiative claimed that it was \n“too much, too cheap, too soon” and that perhaps one could expect to attain \none or two of the “faster, better, cheaper” goals, but not all three. But program \nproponents responded that there were many successes and that most of the \nfailures had resulted from mistakes that either would not have been detected \nunder different management techniques or that had not been detected due \nto improper application of the “faster, better, cheaper” procedures.

There was no money avail\xad\nable to fly another mission of similar profile, given that the Mars Observer \nwas a billion-dollar program. Mars Observer had been freed from the earlier \nrequirement of human rating, but the mission reflected the dominance that \nrequirement had over space science at the time.\nFor space science missions, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin pushed \nfor a new approach called “faster, better, cheaper.” The goal of this approach \nwas to reverse the trend of science missions growing larger and more expen\xad\nsive, the abortive Mars Observer mission being one much-cited exam\xad\nple.28 “Faster, better, cheaper” science mission programs initiated at NASA \nincluded the Discovery program in 1992, the New Millennium program in \n1995, an expanded Mars exploration program with a mission planned every \ntwo years, and the Origins program. According to NASA:\nThrough Goldin’s aggressive management reforms, annual budgets have \nbeen reduced, producing a $40 billion reduction from prior budget plans. He \nimplemented a more balanced aeronautics and space program by reducing \nhuman space flight funding from 48 percent of NASA’s total budget to 38 \npercent and increasing funding for science and aerospace technology from \n31 to 43 percent….\nGoldin also cut the time required to develop Earth- and space-science space\xad\ncraft by 40 percent and reduced the cost by two-thirds, while increasing the \naverage number of missions launched per year about four times. During the \nsame time, Space Shuttle costs were reduced by about a third, while all safety \nindicators and mission capabilities have achieved significant improvements.29\nThe point of the “faster, better, cheaper” exercise was cost control. The \nreality was more brutal. ISS cost overruns were growing, despite the fact \nthat expenditures were supposed to be capped based on the Bush-Congress \ntax-and-cap deal.

Friction \nagainst the spacecraft’s single, 5.5-meter solar array was to have \nslowed the spacecraft as it dipped into the atmosphere each orbit,', 'Three Pathways to Space\n35\nThe overall program objectives common to all three demonstrators included\n1.\t development of an integrated systems test bed for advanced technologies;\n2.\t demonstration of capabilities in realistic ground and flight environ\xad\nments for a next-generation system;\n3.\t demonstration of operability, maintainability, and reusability required \nfor a next-generation system;\n4.\t demonstration of rapid prototyping; and\n5.\t demonstration of the ability to perform “faster, better, cheaper.”\nAn additional objective that applied specifically to the X-33 program was \nthe demonstration of a mass fraction scalable to full-scale single-stage-to-orbit \nuse.4 Two of the RLV programs, the X-33 and X-34, were conducted under \nNASA’s new management concept popularly known as “faster, better, cheaper.”\nA New Way of Doing Business—the “Faster, Better, Cheaper” Concept\nFollowing his appointment as NASA Administrator in 1992, Daniel S. Goldin \ninitiated a widely heralded “faster, better, cheaper” management program \nintended to “revolutionize the structure of NASA.”5 Its objectives were “to cut \ncosts, take greater risks, and dispatch [robotic] spacecraft that actually flew.”6 \nProponents of the initiative also sought to achieve economy without signifi\xad\ncant reductions in reliability. These objectives were to be achieved through \nchanges in technology and management. For a project to be included as part \nof the “faster, better, cheaper” initiative it had “to have a substantially reduced \ncost ceiling, to be placed on a compressed development schedule, and to have \nsomeone with executive responsibility in NASA designate it a ‘faster, better, \ncheaper’ project.”7\nThe concept represented a major cultural change—indeed a veritable \nreversal—compared to how NASA had previously operated, with the excep\xad\ntion of some of its constituent Centers, such as the then-Dryden Flight \nResearch Facility (now Armstrong Flight Research Center), which had a \nrecord of promoting and executing some remarkably sophisticated research \nprojects quickly and economically. As a result, the new management initiative \nmet with significant bureaucratic resistance within the Agency. Prior to the \n“faster, better, cheaper” management initiative, NASA had relied primarily \non a systems-management approach drawn largely from the defense acquisi\xad\ntion world, which was based on what had worked in the 1950s and during \nthe Apollo era, an era of big projects, lofty goals, and robust funding. But \nit is a veritable natural law that, over time, organizations tend to become \nboth more complex and bureaucratically moribund, developing an internal \nsclerosis and sluggishness.\nIn NASA’s case in the early 1990s, this involved ever-larger staffs, the \ninvolvement of multiple Centers, more testing, longer time schedules, and', 'Chapter 4: Applying Lessons Learned\n157\nment plus testing, and Steve [Wissler, the mission operation systems engineer] had \nthe most work to do.”64 That was yet another consequence of the mission’s budgetary \nissues. It wouldn’t be the last.\nExtreme Optimism\nOver the course of the project, costs had increased for reasons beyond the techni\xad\ncal. As Bill Blume, the mission design lead, put it: “Deep Impact was proposed in \nthe Faster, Better, Cheaper environment, and the first proposal went out—the Step\xa01 \nproposal in 98 and the Step Two in 99—and Deep Impact was accepted just months \nbefore the Mars ’98 failures…. People were making cost estimates with just extreme \noptimism, and there’s a competitive nature in the proposal process that just makes \nyou optimistic.”65\nMoreover, public failures unrelated to Deep Impact suddenly became Deep Impact’s \nproblem. As Wissler explained, “The rules kept changing out from under us. Every time \nthere would be a mission failure or something, we would be held to a higher standard \nthan what had been costed originally.”66\nThis manifested at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the form of new sets of stringent, \nconservative, structured approaches to spacecraft development called Flight Project \nPractices and Design Principles. After the twin embarrassments of two consecutive \nMars failures, the lab was tightening screws, and no one was exempt.\nThe lab’s new guidelines meant a stringent, independent verification and validation \nreview process on the hardware, software, processes, and subsystems to certify the \nspacecraft as ready for launch. It felt invasive to Deep Impact’s leadership. No previ\xad\nous project had faced such scrutiny, and budget increases did not accompany the new \nexpensive reviews and processes.\nAlready overworked in the runup to launch, with the added stressors of verifica\xad\ntion and validation processes, the handoff from the integration and testing team to the \nmission operations team “was really a shaky process,” recalled Wissler.67 Losing that \nyear meant losing precious time in space to do spacecraft and instrument calibrations.\nHaving only six months from launch to encounter made the cruise phase a crucible. \nThe team had to work out bugs in everything from “fault protection” mechanisms in \nthe spacecraft to navigation. The High-Resolution Instrument, for example—one of \nthe largest experiments ever built for a planetary science mission, and essential to mis\xad\nsion success—failed to yield “perfect focus.” Initial images were blurry, but a routine \n“bake out” of residual moisture accumulated during launch should have sharpened \n64 \t\nIbid.\n65 \t\nIbid.\n66 \t\nIbid.\n67 \t\nIbid.']","
The impact of the ""faster, better, cheaper"" initiative on the failures of the Mars missions in 1999 is debatable. Critics claimed that it was ""too much, too cheap, too soon"" and that perhaps one could expect to attain one or two of the ""faster, better, cheaper"" goals, but not all three. However, program proponents responded that most of the failures had resulted from mistakes that either would not have been detected under different management techniques or that had not been detected due to improper application of the ""faster, better, cheaper"" procedures. A special assessment team reviewing the failure of the three Mars missions concluded that the ""faster, better, cheaper"" approach was an effective concept that should be continued. A 2010 assessment of the lessons learned from NASA’s “faster, better, cheaper” initiative noted that the initiative improved cost, schedule, and performance all at once and provided an insightful organizational roadmap for sustaining mission success while respecting constraints of time and funding."

The project was to be realized by an ESA-NASA col\xad\nlaboration, with Europe providing the orbiter and NASA the Titan probe. \nEighteen scientific institutions from seven ESA member states were repre\xad\nsented in the group, whose membership included representatives of four \ndisciplines: atmospheric science, planetology, magnetosphere physics, and \nexobiology.

A Saturn orbiter–Titan probe mission was among those recom\xad\nmended by the Solar System Exploration Committee (SSEC) of the NASA \nAdvisory Council. The SSEC had been established by NASA in response to \nthe perceived survival crisis of the U.S. solar system exploration program. \nThe so-called “core program” that the Committee discussed in its April 1983 \nreport represented a concrete proposal for a significant effort in solar system \nexploration, after near-cancellation by the Reagan administration at the end \n5.\t For an overview of Titan science prior to the Cassini-Huygens mission, see A.

Besides the Saturn/Titan mission, the SSEC recommended a radar-\nmapping mission to Venus, a Mars orbiter devoted to geoscience and clima\xad\ntology, and a comet rendezvous and asteroid flyby (CRAF) mission. \nThese initiatives received an important institutional endorsement from \nthe Space Science Committee of the European Science Foundation and \nthe Space Science Board of the U.S. National Research Council. In April \n1982, these two organizations established a Joint Working Group to define \na framework for ESA-NASA cooperation in solar system exploration. The \nJoint Working Group eventually recommended that three missions should \nbe carried out as cooperative projects by the turn of the century. Listed in \norder of launch, they were a Saturn orbiter and Titan probe, a multiple aster\xad\noid orbiter, and a Mars surface rover.8 \nAn assessment study of the Cassini project was conducted between April \n1984 and June 1985 by a team of 13 scientists, 9 from the United States and \n4 from Europe.9 Reversing the idea of the original proposal, the Titan probe \nwas soon identified as ESA’s contribution to the mission, while NASA would \nprovide the main spacecraft, based on the Mariner Mark II spacecraft under \ndevelopment at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The latter was a key \nelement of the SSEC core program, a family of large spacecraft dedicated \nto solar system exploration. The Titan probe, for its part, was considered \nwithin the technical capabilities of the European space industry, and the \nestimated costs were within the budget allocated to a standard mission of \nHorizon\xa02000.\nThe Challenger accident in January 1986 forced a dramatic redefinition \nof NASA’s plans. The Mariner Mark II program was eventually confirmed. \nSpacecraft would be launched on a Titan expendable vehicle instead of \nthe Space Shuttle, but with a two-year delay that deferred the start of the \nCassini project until 1991.

It was only in the mid-1980s that an ambitious \nEuropean planetary mission was considered as a realistic possibility, follow\xad\ning ESA’s successful Giotto mission to Comet Halley (1985–86).

U.S. Government funds may be used for the manufacture or acquisition of flight-ready foreign component technology but cannot be used for foreign-based RLV development of foreign technology unless specifically exempted by the NASA Administrator.

The X-34’s Engine Controversy\nThe engine controversy had been simmering for weeks and came to a head at \nan October 23 meeting between the partners and NASA representatives. NASA \nwanted the higher-performance Russian NPO Energomash RD-120, used as the \nsecond stage on the Russian Zenit rocket and then being marketed in America \nby Pratt & Whitney. Rockwell argued, and not without very good reason, that \nthe lower-performance Rocketdyne RS-27 engine used on the Delta rocket was \na better choice, given the political instability then wracking the former Soviet \nUnion. Indeed, Rockwell reportedly threatened to leave the partnership if the \nRocketdyne engine was not selected.54 NASA threatened to withdraw from the \nprogram and was persuaded to continue only after direct intervention from \nthe White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Lionel \nJohns, associate director for technology in OSTP\n, informed Gary Payton that \nNASA would have to work with Orbital and Rockwell to resolve the engine \ndispute.55 The controversy lasted into late November, when, in a series of tele\xad\nphone conferences, Payton, Michael Griffin (of American Space Lines, and \nfuture NASA Administrator), and Robert Minor (president of Rockwell Space \nSystems Division) tentatively agreed to use the Russian engine.56\nBut this shorthand summary is hardly adequate to address what was a more \ncomplex controversy, and thus some background and further explanation are \nwarranted. Just prior to the conflict’s eruption, NASA had released policy and \nguidelines for the use of foreign technology in the RLV program, stating in part: \n“The RLV technology development and demonstration program may seek to \ntake advantage of all beneficial components and technologies, both foreign and \ndomestic, in developing United States next-generation space transportation \nsystems.

Achieving orbit with the required pay\xad\nload is only part of the challenge that has been undertaken in \nthe NASA/industry RLV program. The other, equally important \nchallenge is to demonstrate a system that is capable of achieving \na lower cost per launch and be clearly competitive with other \nlaunchers worldwide. In the case of the SSTO and maximum \nreusability, all of the components for the vehicle primary system \nstructures, the cryogenic tanks, the thermal protection system \n(TPS), and the propulsion system must first be developed. Then \nit must be demonstrated that these components are reusable with \nminimal inspections or replacements for at least 20 missions and \na have a lifetime of at least 100 missions.43\n“We Have To Move Beyond the Shuttle”: Congress and the RLV Issue\nOn May 16, 1995, the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Science, Technology, \nand Space held a hearing on the future of American space launches. It brought \ntogether key members of Congress, along with representatives of NASA, \nindustry, the aerospace community, and academia. Together, they presented \ntheir views on NASA’s aging Space Shuttle and the emerging reusable launch \nvehicle\xa0program.\nThe hearing quickly got down to the essentials of the RLV issue. In his \nopening statement, Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), subcommittee chairman, \nnoted that \n[a]s great as the Shuttle has been, all agree it will soon start to \noutlive its usefulness. The Shuttle operates on 1970s technolo\xad\ngies, less sophisticated than our average commercial airplane. \nMoreover, the Shuttle costs over $400 million per launch to fly.… \nThe challenge before NASA is to make the current Shuttle more \ncost-effective while also planning for a post-Shuttle future.44\nIn the House, Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), a keen and enthu\xad\nsiastic student of American aerospace, agreed that “if we are going to have cheap \nand regular access to space, if we are going to be the leader in launch tech\xad\nnologies, we have to move beyond the Shuttle.” In an extensive statement, he \ninvoked returning to “the old idea of X-vehicles” and praised NASA for seeking \nstronger partnerships with private industry.

The Department of Defense and NASA \nwere directed to plan for the transition between space programs and future \nlaunch systems in a manner that would ensure continuity of mission capability \nand accommodate transition costs. They also were directed to combine their \nexpendable launch service requirements into single procurements, when such \nprocurements would result in cost savings or otherwise accrue advantages to the \nGovernment.35 Finally, the policy directive noted that “[i]t is envisioned that \nthe private sector could have a significant role in managing the development \nand operation of a new reusable space transportation system. In anticipation \nof this role, NASA shall actively involve the private sector in planning and \nevaluating its launch technology activities.”36 \nNASA and the Winged-Body RLV Concept\nFrom April 1994 to January 1995, NASA and several of its industry partners \nconducted a study to analyze the winged-body single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) \nreusable launch vehicle (RLV) concept. The stated primary objectives of the \noverall studies were to develop a better technical understanding of three dif\xad\nferent design concepts—winged-body, vertical-lander, and lifting-body—and \na consistent set of ground rules for an applicable upper stage. A consistent set \nof ground rules was necessary in order to perform an equitable comparison \nof the three different concepts that were based on different ground rules and \nassumptions. The analytical results of the study also were intended to establish \nthe targets required for the technology program. The study team believed that \nonce a standard set of ground rules and assumptions was established, the pros \nand cons of each concept could be weighed to furnish answers to fundamen\xad\ntal questions relating to system weight (always a critical and sensitive issue), \ntechnology targets, and requirements change or “creep.” The study team asked \nthese questions, among others:37\n•\t How well do NASA’s preliminary sizing tools predict vehicle \nperformance? \n•\t Are all issues correctly understood? \n•\t Are the right technologies being pursued? \n•\t Is emphasis being placed on the right technologies?\n•\t How can NASA measure the technology maturation? \n•\t How would requirements impact size, engine choice, and required \nmaterials? \nInitial Analysis\nBased on the availability of data, the winged-body (WB 001) concept was the \nfirst established reference configuration, to be followed by the vertical-lander', 'The Quest for Propulsive Efficiency, 1976–1989\n105\nto reduce fuel consumption by 50 percent, or over 600,000 barrels of oil \na day.8 The Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences held hearings, \nwhich included considerable debate for and against the program, during \nthe fall and winter of 1975. In the end, the program received approval and \nrecommendation for implementation during fiscal year 1976. The reasons \nfor approval were many. Increased fuel efficiency would stimulate the U.S. \naviation industry and give both air carriers and manufacturers a competitive \nedge in world markets while encouraging conservation and American energy \nindependence. Overall, taking on such a monumental challenge was appro\xad\npriate for the Federal Government through NASA due to the technical risks \ninvolved and the nonproprietary role the Agency would play in disseminating \nthe program’s results to all of industry.9\nThe ACEE was what has been termed a “focused” research and development \nprogram. In other words, NASA allocated large amounts of funding and engi\xad\nneering resources to mature fundamental technology successes already under\xad\nway to create full-scale demonstration technology. Overall, NASA intended the \nprogram as a partnership with industry with a clear path of technology transfer \noriginating from the Agency.10 The project also facilitated parallel and inter\xad\ntwined research into noise and emissions since needed improvements in one \nsphere affected the others. As a result, the fuel-savings-oriented ACEE program \nincorporated NASA’s most comprehensive noise and emissions effort to date.11\nThe industry and Government partners in the ACEE program addressed \nsix major areas divided into three groups. The aerodynamics effort included \nthe Energy Efficient Transport and laminar flow control, while the structures \nportion addressed composite materials.12 Lewis Research Center, under the \nleadership of program manager Donald Nored, managed the propulsion com\xad\nponent, which represented three levels of development toward reducing fuel \nconsumption. For the short term, the Engine Component Improvement (ECI) \nProgram targeted a 5-percent reduction in existing engines, specifically the \nPratt & Whitney JT8D and JT9D turbofans and the GE CF6 that powered \nthe majority of airliner fleets around the world. The Energy Efficient Engine \n(E3, also EEE, and pronounced “E-cubed”) turbofan program was intended \nto decrease fuel consumption by 12 percent in the new engines of the late \n1980s. NASA leaders believed that new fuel-conserving technology exhib\xad\niting increased thermodynamic and propulsive efficiencies would appear in \nderivative or entirely new commercial engines as early as 1983. The Advanced \nTurboprop Project (ATP) offered the most fuel savings, upwards of 15 percent, \nfor its intended introduction in the early 1990s.

The engine controversy was about the choice of engine for the X-34, with NASA wanting the higher-performance Russian NPO Energomash RD-120 and Rockwell arguing for the lower-performance Rocketdyne RS-27 engine. The controversy lasted for several weeks and was only resolved after direct intervention from the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.

NASA provided guidelines for the use of foreign technology in the RLV program, which stated that foreign participation must provide clear net benefits for the achievement of the program’s technical and business objectives, U.S. Government funds may be used for the manufacture or acquisition of flight-ready foreign component technology but cannot be used for foreign-based RLV development of foreign technology, and the use of foreign technology must not threaten the successful execution of the program in either its developmental or operational stages."
"What were the factors that contributed to the ease of handling of the Clipper, and what was the rationale behind providing spacious quarters for the crew?","The factors that contributed to the ease of handling of the Clipper were the use of cantilever surfaces, a split trailing edge wing flap, and a clean intersection between the hull and the wing. These design features allowed for a streamlined and efficient aircraft that required minimal maintenance and provided good access for inspection and repair to parts that would require maintenance. The rationale behind providing spacious quarters for the crew was to minimize their fatigue, conserve their energy, and increase their efficiency for long-range operation. The control cabin was designed to be completely lined and trimmed in the same fashion as the passenger compartments, even to the window shades and the rug on the floor, to facilitate maintenance and increase efficiency. The crew's quarters were provided with three berths and provisions for stowing clothes and crew's personal equipment, as well as part of the ship's radio equipment. In addition, four more folding bunks were located in the bow compartment, providing a total of seven berths available for the crew. The design objective of unusually large and luxurious passenger accommodations in the Clipper was readily realizable because of the great space allowed in the passenger deck. The whole was divided into a series of adjoining passenger cabins, equipped with davenport-type seats convertible into upper and lower berths, deluxe compartments with special furnishings and complete privacy, roomy and modern dressing rooms, a completely equipped galley, a large centrally-located dining salon and recreation center, where passengers can mix and enjoy social pastime. The control room design that was laid out for these functions had the unprec­
edented dimensions of 21½ feet long by 9½ feet wide by 6 feet 1½ inches high. A full size “mock-up” in wood was built and provided with dummy equipment so the arrangements could all be tried out in advance. The pilots were given comfortable seats adjustable in many ways and were given only the essential instruments and controls, leaving other work to other crew members. The controls were arranged on convenient stands beside the pilots. An interesting innovation was the remote control system for the automatic gyropilot. At a comfortable position beside each pilot, two little wheels were mounted at right angles to each other: one for making turns and one for operating the elevators. As simply as though he were operating an armchair control of a modern home radio set","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n344\nbooks and supplies. Navigation instruments permanently mounted include an ape\xad\nriodic compass, chronometer, altimeter, airspeed indicator, outside air temperature \nindicator, and a Gatty drift indicator.\nIn addition to these instruments which are all located at the navigator’s station, \nthere are provided two drift sight stations for taking the ship’s drift with a pelorus. \nThese drift sight stations are accessible from the crew’s quarters through doors in \neach side of the hull and are located in the lower surface of the wing near the trail\xad\ning edge. Also, a streamlined observatory for making celestial observations is built \ninto the large cargo loading hatch in the top of the hull. A folding seat is mounted \nunder this observatory so that the navigator may comfortably take his observations. \nIncidentally, this observatory is just over the center of gravity of the aircraft and \ntherefore is in an ideal location.\nThe control cabin is completely lined and trimmed in the same fashion as the \npassenger compartments, even to the window shades and the rug on the floor. No \nplumbing or wiring is visible and we believe this control cabin is unprecedented in \nappearance, comfort, arrangement and utility. In producing such accommodations \nfor the crew to work in, we believe we have minimized their fatigue, conserved their \nenergy, and thus increased their efficiency for long-range operation.\nDuring the period of preliminary design it was decided that the ship should \nhave two decks: one entirely for the passengers and the other to be the flight deck \naccom[m]odating the crew and cargo. The flight deck is comprised of three main \nsections: the control cabin which has already been described, the baggage, mail and \ncargo compartments, and the crew’s quarters.\nBehind the control cabin and in the center section of the wing and hull may \nbe found the baggage, mail and cargo compartments. Still farther aft are the crew’s \nquarters in which there are three berths, provisions for stowing clothes and crew’s \npersonal equipment and part of the ship’s radio equipment. In addition to the three \nberths provided in the crew’s quarters, four more folding bunks are located in the \nbow compartment so that[,] in all[,] there are seven berths available for the crew.\nIn order to facilitate maintenance and thus increase the efficiency of operation \nno effort has been spared to make every part as accessible for inspection and repair \nas possible. In order to do this we decided it would be necessary to make the design \nsuch that the engines would be accessible in flight. Access to all engines is made \nthrough two doors, one on each side of the control cabin, which lead to passage\xad\nways just forward of the front spar. These passageways lead to two nacelles on each \nside. Slight men can transverse these passageways in a crouched position, while \nheavier man [sic] travel more easily on their hands and knees.\nEach engine nacelle is sixty-nine inches in diameter and holds four men com\xad\nfortably. A stainless steel firewall, which can be easily removed in two sections in \nflight, is mounted behind each engine, thus permitting access to the rear of engines \nand engine accessories in flight. It has been said that the advantages of having access \nto the engines and powerplant installation in flight are only problematical [sic], but', '215\nDocument 5-16\nthese factors generally resulted in a change [in all] of them, which was instructive \nbut\xa0tedious.\nAll of the determining factors had been obtained, but surfaces of a different \ncamber and curvature and the trailing aileron were used and the size of the boat \nwas increased. The hood for the protection of the aviator was developed on this \nmodel, and also the proper location of the rear controls. These were so placed that \nwhen the machine was running on the water, the air rudder was used as a water \nrudder, and at the same time the other controls were raised so that they would not \nbe endangered by the waves. No advantage was found in the use of the trailing \naileron and it was abandoned.\nThe original model was again rebuilt and the results of all the experiments \nembodied in it. This was then tried out at Hammondsport over Lake Keuka, under \nall conditions of wind and weather obtainable there, and was found to handle per\xad\nfectly. I tried the machine out at this time and was more than pleased with it, but \nstill not thoroughly convinced that it would handle well under bad weather and \nbad weather conditions, and suggested that it be shipped to some place where these \ncould be obtained. As a result the machine was shipped to Charlotte, a suburb of \nRochester, N.Y., on Lake Ontario, and for the first time I prayed for wind and \nrough water before flying, but even that brought no results for five days. Then there \ncame a northeaster and after this had subsided the water remained rough, about a \nfour-foot sea, and the wind was blowing between twelve and fifteen miles an hour. \nThe machine was then given a thorough test, and found to be dry on the water, \neasily handled in the water, and satisfactory in every respect.\nSome of the tests were: running on the water at full speed headed into the wind \nand sea; with wind and sea following; in a cross sea; turning both into and away \nfrom the wind, at both high and low speeds. Next came rising from and lighting on \nthe water, with the wind ahead, astern, and on the beam. This was easily accom\xad\nplished, but would have surely meant a spill in the old type hydro-aeroplane. The \nfinal and hardest test was stalling the machine and allowing it to drop from low \naltitudes, to determine if it was structurally strong enough. This was started very \nclose to the water, but the last drop was from a height of nearly fifteen feet, and \nnothing was strained or broken.\nHere was tested the invention of Mr. Curtiss for enabling the aeroplane to ride \nsafely on the water with the engine stopped and a strong wind blowing. If some \nmeans were not employed, when there is both wind and sea, and the machine is \ndead in the water, the wind will get under the weather wing and cause the machine \nto capsize. I have referred to the triangular extensions at the ends of the upper \nplanes. These extensions are hinged and connected to a lever [on the] back of the \noperator’s seat, and a movement of this lever drops these extensions to an angle of \nforty-five degrees with the main planes, and rigidly holds them in that position. \nNow the pressure of the wind on the windward wing will be on top of this exten\xad\nsion and tend to keep this wing down. On the lower wing it will be under this', '359\nDocument 5-23 (a–c)\nappear many other safety devices and precautions too numerous to mention. Add \nto all this the safety which is inherent to all four-engine equipment and in par\xad\nticular to large flying boats, and the reliability and practicality of the big Clippers \nbecomes\xa0apparent.\nSome conception of the intricacies of the project of designing and manufactur\xad\ning these flying boats can be gained from the fact that each of the ships embodies \napproximately 50,000 different parts. This number does not include some 15,230 \nbolts and approximately one million rivets. All through the design and construc\xad\ntion process, it was naturally necessary to maintain accurate weight control, and \nit is interesting to note that the weight of the aircraft on its actual weighing was \nwithin approximately fifty pounds, or about one-tenth of one percent, of the esti\xad\nmated weight empty.\nThe project, in all, required 17,500 square feet of original engineering draw\xad\nings, and 385,000 square feet of blueprints. Spread on the ground, these blue\xad\nprints would cover eight acres. The electrical system contains 11½ miles of wiring, \ninstalled in 400 runs of conduit. The plumbing system involves 3,000 feet of tub\xad\ning and the control system includes 5,000 feet of cable. The hull itself has an out\xad\nside surface area of 4,000 square feet—one-tenth of an acre.\nBecause of the size of the component parts of the plane, a good deal of larger \nshop equipment had to be installed in the various manufacturing shops of the \nplant; and assembly methods in many ways approached ship-building technique. \nThe hulls were assembled in giant jigs much like ship-building cradles, encircled \nby a maze of scaffolding and walkways allowing workmen to work at five dif\xad\nferent levels simultaneously. Wings were assembled in a separate building. At the \nfinal stage each of the Clippers was moved outside on a movable “drydock,” where \nwings, hydrostabilizers and engines were attached, and where the ship was launched \nupon\xa0completion.\nLarge as these Clippers may have appeared at the time, the public has already \nbecome quite accustomed to their size and no longer views them with such wonder\xad\nment. They have taken their place as a standard part of America’s transportation \nsystem. Their transoceanic flights have become a routine operation, and have well \nproven that large aircrafts can be successfully built for regular commercial use. It \nis hoped that the design of these planes will be the stepping stone to even larger, \nhigher performance [and] more efficient, more luxurious and safer aircraft.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n338\nThis is, of course, the old, old story, but the problem becomes really serious on long-\nrange aircraft because of the larger amount of fuel required for every extra pound \nof drag. In other words, the savings in weight of fuel required must be balanced \nagainst the cost in weight of any refinement in design which will reduce the drag. \nNaturally, the design speed and range are important factors in this computation.\nThus, it was decided that all surfaces were to be cantilever and that the ship \nmust be as clean as practicable. The aerodynamic and hydrodynamic design then \nprogressed and a brief description follows.\nAn aspect ratio of 8.05 was chosen for the wing because it was a balance \nbetween aerodynamic and structural considerations. Primarily, in order to keep the \nstructural weight down the wing was tapered in both plan and thickness, the taper \nin plan form being approximately 4 to 1. Even with this amount of taper in plan, \nno adverse tip stalling has been experienced. These tapers had other advantages in \nthat they produced a thicker wing section near the root, allowing passageways for \nthe crew to get to the engine nacelles and also allowing space for large cargo holds \nin the wing stub. The symmetrical NACA 0018 section was used at the root and \nwas tapered in thickness to the 0010 section of the same series at the tip. The aero\xad\ndynamical advantages of using a symmetrical section are that it has low profile drag \nand high L over D ⁄L over DL over D ratio in the cruising range and from a structural viewpoint is easier \nto jig and construct because of the identical contours on both the upper and lower \nsurfaces. Although the maximum lift coefficient of a symmetrical section without \nflaps is usually lower than that of many high lift sections, the addition of flaps to \nthe symmetrical section usually improves the lift coefficient to that equal to the \nbest of the so-called high lift sections.\nThe Model 314 utilizes a split trailing edge wing flap along these portions \nof the span not occupied by the hull and ailerons. During landings, the full flap \ndeflection of 60 degrees is usually utilized; while for take-off, an angle of 20° is \nbeneficial.\nThe hull is designed so that the center section of the wing passes through \nthe upper portion of the hull in such a manner as to produce a clean intersection \nbetween the hull and the wing, thus reducing the interference drag usually found \nwith cabane arrangements where the wing is mounted above the hull. This arrange\xad\nment also allows, without much increase in weight, additional volume for passenger \nand crew accommodations.\nThe hull bottom has an athwartship main stop and a pointed rear step. The \npointed rear step produces less aerodynamic drag than the usual athwartship rear \nstep, yet has excellent water running characteristics and allows the practical instal\xad\nlation of a water rudder so necessary on large flying boats.\nThe hull bottom lines and chines were designed to keep the bow wave as clean \nand low as possible in order to keep the hull dry, and to give quick takeoff char\xad\nacteristics. Flight and taxi tests have shown that this hull is remarkably dry, has \nexceptionally clean running characteristics and has extremely low takeoff time.', '357\nDocument 5-23 (a–c)\ncalculation of power and fuel required to fly under the conditions set by the naviga\xad\ntor and pilot; and the radio operator, who is assigned the responsibility of maintain\xad\ning contact with the ground stations and to furnish radio bearings to the navigator.\nThe control room design that was laid out for these functions had the unprec\xad\nedented dimensions of 21½ feet long by 9½ feet wide by 6 feet 1½ inches high. A \nfull size “mock-up” in wood was built and provided with dummy equipment so the \narrangements could all be tried out in advance. The pilots were given comfortable \nseats adjustable in many ways and were given only the essential instruments and \ncontrols, leaving other work to other crew members. The controls were arranged \non convenient stands beside the pilots. An interesting innovation was the remote \ncontrol system for the automatic gyropilot. At a comfortable position beside each \npilot, two little wheels were mounted at right angles to each other: one for making \nturns and one for operating the elevators. As simply as though he were operating an \narmchair control of a modern home radio set, either pilot could sit back and govern \nthe action of the ship by merely rotating the little wheels a few revolutions.\nThe navigator’s station, with navigating instruments and a chart desk large \nenough to accommodate full size nautical charts, was located just behind the first \npilot; and the master’s desk was given the position immediately aft of the navigator. \nThe radio operator was located behind the second pilot. Aft of this post the flight \nengineer’s station was placed, with an elaborate panel of instruments and controls \nfor power plant operation, thus relieving the pilots of this concern. The entire con\xad\ntrol room was thoroughly soundproofed so the men could talk with each other in \nconversational tones, although an interphone system is also provided.\nIn order to reduce maintenance in an aircraft, the designer strives to provide \ngood initial design that will require a minimum of attention and to provide good \naccess for inspection and repair to parts that will require maintenance. These fac\xad\ntors were given utmost attention in planning the Clipper. The greatest innovation \nin this direction was the provision of access into the wings and engine nacelles \nduring flight, by way of two doors in the control room leading to right and left \nwing passageways. Subsequent flight operations have shown again and again the \nadvantages of this engine accessibility. Likewise, oil tanks, valves, and the greater \nportion of the plumbing for the engine lubrication, deicer fluid, hydraulic oil, water \nvacuum and fuel systems were also made accessible in flight. This means that \ninspections may be made periodically during flight and any malfunction can be \nimmediately diagnosed.\nThe design objective of unusually large and luxurious passenger accommoda\xad\ntions in the Clipper was readily realizable because of the great space allowed in the \npassenger deck. The whole was divided into a series of adjoining passenger cabins, \nequipped with davenport-type seats convertible into upper and lower berths, deluxe \ncompartment with special furnishings and complete privacy, roomy and modern \ndressing rooms, a completely equipped galley, [and] a large centrally-located dining \nsalon and recreation center, where passengers can mix and enjoy social pastime.']","
The factors that contributed to the ease of handling of the Clipper included proper distribution of responsibility among the crew, arrangement and convenience of all controls, equipment and instruments, comfort and accommodations provided for the crew both on and off duty, efficient and simple methods for loading fuel, cargo and passengers, arrangement of mooring devices, and methods of beaching.

The rationale behind providing spacious quarters for the crew was that the aircraft was primarily a long-range transport, and every effort should be made to provide the crew with every conceivable aid, not only in equipment, but in comfort and accommodations. It was decided that the duties of the crew should be so delegated that a flight crew of six would be on duty at all times, and that spacious quarters should be provided for their use."
"What is the most favorable location for a radiator, water condenser, or other heat exchange device on an airship and why?","In the context of the given text, the most favorable location for a radiator, water condenser, or other heat exchange device on an airship would be just inside the hull, as previously stated. However, for the specific case of the RS-1 airship, which has been experiencing a heavy power plant handicap, the redesign of the power plant, including the substitution of two new engines and the corresponding simplification and lightening in weight, may provide an opportunity to reconsider the location of the heat exchange device. The new engines may allow for a smaller heat exchange apparatus, which could be placed closer to the exterior of the hull to take advantage of the skin's heat radiating surface. This would reduce the area required for the heat exchange device and potentially improve performance. However, the design compromise between drag and space availability, weight, complication, and maintenance would still need to be considered.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n156\n3. Resistance of Accessories. It has not yet been found feasible to house all \nof the equipment of an airship within the streamlined hull, although there pre\xad\nvails a decided tendency to eliminate more and more of the outside appendages \nand protuberances. So long as individual propellers are disposed about the ship \nthere are outriggers or complete power cars outside which require individual fair\xad\ning. The control car accommodating the navigating crew is usually located in the \nforward lower part of the hull. An empennage is carried at the tail. Furthermore, \nground handling and mooring attachments usually protrude from the hull. Last \nbut not least there are items of equipment such as radiators and other devices for \nthe exchange of heat, and likewise hoods and vents for the intake or expulsion of \nventilation air and again certain navigational instruments, all of which depend \nupon exposure to the outside air for their proper operation.\nEvidently the drag of such protuberances and appendages can be calculated \nfrom model experiments made on much larger scale than for the ship as a whole. In \nall of this, allowance must of course be made for any local excess or deficiency of \nairspeed due to the potential flow or the boundary layer about the ship.\nOccasionally, relatively small protuberances, especially on the forebody on a \nmodel tested at [a] low Reynolds number, have shown an apparent influence by way \nof an increase of drag far beyond any normal expectation based on the drag of the \nprotuberance itself. That similar freak influences would occur in full dimension \nseems rather doubtful in the light of experiments made with artificial “spoilers” on \nfull size ships and in high Reynolds number model tests.\nThe drag of nacelles or power cars can be estimated from experiments on simi\xad\nlar objects occurring in heavier than air design provided allowance is made, if nec\xad\nessary, for the proximity to the airship hull which acts as a mirror surface of the \nwash of the propeller slip stream, and if need be, of the flow through such a car \ncontaining a radiator vent, or the like.\nUndoubtedly the most favorable location, from the viewpoint of drag, for a \nradiator, water condenser, or other heat exchange device, would be just inside the \nhull so that the skin of the ship, the friction of which is inevitable, could be utilized \nas a heat radiating surface without adding parasite resistance. The area required in \nsuch case is, of course, much larger, since the heat must traverse the entire bound\xad\nary layer of the hull. However in view of the fact that the heat transfer varies with a \nfractional power of the velocity head, the handicap is not necessarily insurmount\xad\nable. Just how far the finning of a heat exchange apparatus should protrude into the \nship’s boundary layer is a matter of design compromise into which considerations of \nspace available, weight, complication and maintenance enter, aside from the mere \nquestion of drag.\nThe drag of the fins of an airship can be computed from model experimental \ndata with a similar degree of accuracy as in the case of airplanes, excepting only that \ntheir huge size renders a beneficial scale effect of frictional resistance of importance. \nFor conservative estimates, however, it is well to add a certain average of induced', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n90\n•\t\nAn “in-line” arrangement of propellers, four propellers on each side.\n•\t\nPropellers suspended from outrigger struts with means for tilting each \npropeller through an angle of 90°.

Akron have not been com\xad\npletely evaluated, but enough has been learned to warrant the belief that the airship \ndesign is fundamentally sound. A new set of propellers will be required before the \nmaximum possible speed of the airship can be attained.\nThe second airship included in the airship program of the Navy Department, \nfor which contract was made at the same time as that for the U.S.S. Akron, is sched\xad\nuled for completion about January, 1933.\nThe material condition of the U.S.S. Los Angeles, as revealed by periodic inspec\xad\ntion and check tests of representative samples, continues to be satisfactory.\nOperations of small airships of the nonrigid type have been continued by the \nArmy, the Navy, and by private interests. The performance of these airships in sev\xad\neral instances has been noteworthy.\nThe small experimental metal-clad airship owned by the Navy Department \nhas been successfully operated during the past year. Measurements have shown that \nsuperheat is created and lost very rapidly in this type of airship. Tests of samples \nremoved from the hull plating of the airship showed practically no deterioration in \nthe thin metal hull covering after 18 months’ operation.\nExcellent progress has been made in mechanical ground-handling methods \nfor large rigid airships and warrants the assertion that a satisfactory solution to \nthis important problem is close at hand. The troublesome feature of how to haul \nthe stern of an airship broadside to the wind and hold it there has apparently been \nsolved. A circular railroad track with its center located on the shed axis extended', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n92\nThe four-in-line tandem arrangement of propellers in the Akron has brought to \nlight a number of problems connected with this propulsive system. Owing to wan\xad\ndering of the propeller slipstreams as they flow aft because of gusts and undulations \nof the airship, widely differing over-all propulsive efficiencies are obtained when \ndifferent combinations of propellers are operating. This makes it difficult to pro\xad\nvide a type of propeller that will be efficient over the wide range of airship speeds. \nThe present wooden propellers on the Akron are to be replaced by metal propellers \nof changeable pitch, and the expectation is that with these propellers more efficient \npropulsion at normal cruising speeds will be obtained.\nA satisfactory apparatus for recovering water ballast from the engine exhaust, \nthus permitting helium-filled airships to maintain equilibrium in flight without \nvalving gas, continues to prove a baffling problem. The problem is one peculiar \nto helium-filled airships. In the Akron the difficulties of the problem have been \naccentuated by the necessity for using tetraethyl lead in the fuel which engenders \ncorrosion in parts of the recovery apparatus. A new type of light and compact water-\nballast-recovery apparatus has been developed at Lakehurst and applied experi\xad\nmentally to the Akron. Fundamentally, it is similar to a large honeycomb radiator. \nThe cooling air passes through the tubes, and the exhaust gases flow around them \nwithin a streamline[d] casing. The drag of this type will be somewhat higher than \nprevious types, but its weight will be materially less and its maintenance simpler.\nThe power plant of an airship and its installation present a number of problems \nfor which various solutions can be obtained, and upon the solution adopted will \ndepend the efficiency, economy, safety, and reliability of the airship operation. It is \ndesirable, therefore, that research along various lines connected with improvements \nin airship power plants be prosecuted vigorously, both in laboratories and under \nflight conditions. Various improvements in airship power plants are under develop\xad\nment in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe Akron is the first airship in the world to be equipped with a hangar for car\xad\nrying airplanes. Hitherto airplanes have been attached to or dropped from an exter\xad\nnal trapeze on an airship, but the operation of airplanes to and from the Akron has \nbecome routine. Four airplanes may be stowed in the hangar and a fifth one, carried \non the trapeze, may also be lifted into the hangar. New developments are under way \nto decrease the time interval between launching or picking up successive\xa0airplanes.\nThe U.S. airship Los Angeles has been laid up as a matter of economy, but her \nmaterial condition is still good, after nearly eight years’ service, and she could be \nrecommissioned on short notice.\nThe experimental metal-clad airship ZMC-2 continues in successful operation. \nShe has been deflated and reinflated only once during three years of service.\nIn the field of mechanical handling of airships, the Navy Department has con\xad\ntinued to make good progress. The stern handling beam described in last year’s \nreport has been found invaluable in taking the U.S. airship Akron in and out of the \nhangar at Lakehurst. A special wind-tunnel investigation into the forces acting on', '83\nDocument 5-2 (a–s)\noperation at a time, competitive effort has not been possible. Development would \nbe faster if more rigid airships were available. The large cost of rigid airships and the \nfact that only one is now available forced a cautious, conservative scheme of opera\xad\ntion which, though sound, has not as yet allowed the technique of rigid airship \noperation to develop to the full extent of its possibilities. This situation will correct \nitself when more airships and better facilities are available.\nThe facilities for the operation of rigid airships in the United States are not \nthe best and additional facilities are needed. There are only two large sheds—\nat Lakehurst and at Scott Field. The former in particular is poorly located from \na meteorological standpoint. The shortage of helium and meager facilities for its \ntransportation and storage have retarded the operation of rigid airships at intervals. \nSeveral mooring masts have been erected at strategic points, but the masts remote \nfrom the shed base have been used only once.\nArrangements and mechanical appliances for landing airships and handling \nthem on the ground, and in or out of sheds, are being improved with experience. \nAs a result we should be prepared to handle the larger airships now contemplated \nwith no more difficulty, and perhaps with less difficulty, than airships of the Los \nAngeles size. There has been gratifying progress in developing the floating mast, the \nfixed stub mast, the mobile stub mast, mechanically operated docking trolleys, cars \nfor supporting airships while moving in and out of sheds, [an] artificial superheat \ndevice, remote control for hauling down winches and the deck landing platform.\nThe operation of airships, like airplanes, is influenced by weather conditions \nand will be facilitated by improved weather information service. A new system for \nthe collection and distribution of weather reports has recently been worked out by \nthe Weather Bureau in cooperation with the telegraph companies. This will much \nfacilitate the prompt furnishing of aerological information so necessary for the safe \nnavigation of the air.\nFOREIGN DEVELOPMENT\nNo survey of rigid airship development would be complete without a résumé of \nwhat is being done by other nations.\nGermany, the original home of the rigid airship, and where it finds most enthu\xad\nsiastic support, is just completing a 3,650,000 cubic foot airship, funds for which \nwere raised largely by popular subscription. It is proposed that this airship, after \nmaking demonstration flights, including one to the United States, will be used to \nstart a commercial line between Spain and South America. The design is a modern \nand enlarged copy of the Los Angeles. This airship will carry a large portion of its \nfuel in gaseous form. This permits an important increase in cruising range. This \ndevelopment is being watched with interest[,] and a combination of helium and a \nfuel gas offers attractive possibilities without much greater risk than with helium \nalone and gasoline.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n78\nnotable degree. This equipment is now being constructed and[,] it is expected[,] \nwill be tested in the coming year.\nWork with “RS-1.”—This airship has made several notable flights from its home \nstation at Scott Field, including one to Langley Field and Lakehurst. It has been \nextremely active in spite of the handicap imposed on it by a very heavy power plant.\nSteps are now being taken toward the redesign of the power plant, including \nthe substitution of two new engines in place of the four now in use, together with \nthe corresponding simplification and lightening in weight. No reverse gears are to \nbe fitted but the propellers are to be made reversing.\nThe nose cone originally fitted, having shown indications of weakness, has \nbeen replaced by a new nose cone of an improved design which has operated with \nentire satisfaction. When the proposed modifications have been completed[,] this \nairship should be very much improved in performance.\nMetal-clad airship.—Progress on the design and construction of this airship, \nwhich is being supplied to the Navy Department by the Aircraft Development \nCorporation of Detroit, has been reported.\nNew mooring masts.—The mooring mast constructed at Scott Field, Belleville, Ill., \nby the Aircraft Development Corporation has been tried out and found to be very \nsuccessful.

The most favorable location for a radiator, water condenser, or other heat exchange device on an airship would be just inside the hull. This is because the skin of the ship, which is inevitable, could be utilized as a heat radiating surface without adding parasite resistance. However, the area required in such case is larger since the heat must traverse the entire boundary layer of the hull. Despite this, the handicap is not necessarily insurmountable because the heat transfer varies with a fractional power of the velocity head. The finning of a heat exchange apparatus should protrude into the ship’s boundary layer to a certain average of induced drag, which is a matter of design compromise considering space available, weight, complication, and maintenance, aside from the mere question of drag."
"Can you explain the concept of rotation in fluid dynamics, including how it is defined, calculated, and its relationship to potential flow? Provide examples of its significance in fluid motion.","In fluid dynamics, the concept of rotation is significant in understanding the behavior of fluids in motion. It refers to the angular velocity of a fluid element around an axis, which is defined as the ratio of the circulation around an infinitesimal surface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis to the area of the surface. The total rotation is a vector and is obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular axes. In potential flow, where the flow is irrotational, the circulation around any closed curve is zero. However, in non-potential flow, the circulation around a closed curve is not necessarily zero, and this can lead to the formation of vortices, which can have significant effects on the flow. Vortices can cause separation of the flow, which can lead to increased drag and decreased lift. An example of the significance of rotation in fluid motion is the flow around a cylinder or a wing. In these cases, the flow is not potential, and there is a significant amount of rotation in the flow. This rotation can cause the formation of a vortex behind the cylinder or the wing, which can lead to increased drag and decreased lift. The calculation of rotation involves determining the circulation around an infinitesimal surface, which can be used to analyze the flow and identify areas of high rotation. The most valuable property of the representation of flow by a function Φ is that the sum of two or more functions Φ, each of which satisfies the Laplace equation, also satisfies this equation and therefore represents a possible type of flow. This property is known as the superposition of flows. In summary, the concept of rotation in fluid dynamics is important for understanding the behavior of fluids in motion. It can have significant effects on the flow, including the formation of vortices, which can lead to increased drag and decreased lift. The calculation of rotation involves determining the circulation around an infinitesimal surface, which can be used to analyze the flow and identify areas of high rotation.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n136\ninventor laughed at, who proposed to tie inflated rubber hose around the rims of \ncarriage wheels.

It seems to \nme in that connection that the airflow studies so far have been too much concen\xad\ntrated on potential flows. The vortuous air motions of many descriptions should \nalso be carefully studied and their physical laws explored. This should be done in \nboth ways, theoretically and experimentally. The ordinary wind-tunnels are not \nthe only instruments of flow research, and merely making them larger and larger \nrequires the least imagination, but it is not enough.\nI am engaged in giving evidence for the proposition that aerodynamic science \nis still far from being brought to anything resembling its conclusion. In that con\xad\nnection it is important to show that even the most general foundation of that sci\xad\nence is still in the state of vigorous growth. I myself, only during the past year, have \nbeen privileged to discover a very broad and fundamental theorem relating to fluid \nmotion, of geometric nature, and as broad as all geometry. This gathering seems to \nme a worthy occasion to announce that theorem publicly for the first time.\nMy theorem relates to the momentum of a body of fluid of constant density. \nIt states that that momentum is always equal to the static moment of the source \nand sink system of the body of fluid, regarding the flux through the boundary \nof the fluid as part of such system too. The remarkable feature of the theorem is \nthat it holds always, whatever the motion of the fluid may be. No matter whether \nthis is the motion of an ideal or of a viscous fluid, whether it move[s] regularly or \nirregularly, steadily or unsteadily, whether the motion has a potential or not, if only \nthe motion is conceivable by human intellect and continuous enough to compute \nthe sources and sinks, that theorem must hold and can be employed with profit. In \norder to have in this paper something more than a mere enumeration of problems, \nI will indicate how the correctness of the problems may be demonstrated.\nImagine one pair of a source and sink of equal strength. Let all fluid being \ndelivered flow to the sink through a narrow straight tube. Let this tube like region \nhave constant cross-section. The velocity within is then constant and the momen\xad\ntum easily computed, being equal to the product of the density of the fluid, of the \nvolume of the tube, and of the velocity of the fluid.\nNow double the volume by doubling the cross section of the tube. The velocity \nthen drops to one half, and hence the above product, the momentum, remains the \nsame. The same for any other ratio of cross section increase. The same is true if only \na portion of the tube is thus increased or diminished. It follows, then, that each \nstraight tube, of whatever variable cross-section, will give the same momentum.

Applications of this will \nbe given in section 14.\n11. The discussion of the principles of the \nhydrodynamics of nonviscous fluids to be applied \nby us may be stopped here. I add but one con\xad\nsideration, which has reference to a very useful \ntheorem for obtaining the forces in fluid motion, \nnamely the so-called “momentum theorem for \nstationary\xa0motions.”\nWe have to apply to fluid motion the theorem \nof general mechanics, which states that the rate of \nchange with the time of the linear momentum is \nequal to the resultant of all the external forces. To \ndo this, consider a definite portion of the fluid sep\xad\narated from the rest of the fluid by a closed surface. \nThis surface may, in accordance with the spirit of \nthe theorem, be considered as a “fluid surface,” i.e., made up always of the same \nfluid particles. We must now state in a formula the change of the momentum of \nthe fluid within the surface. If, as we shall assume, the flow is stationary, then \nafter a time dt every fluid particle in the interior will be replaced by another, which \nhas the same velocity as had the former. On the boundary, however, owing to its \ndisplacement, mass will pass out at the side where the fluid is approaching, and a \ncorresponding mass will enter on the side away from which the flow takes place.

The special case when \nin a fluid flow the phenomena \nin all planes which are parallel \nto a given plane coincide abso\xad\nlutely plays an important role \nboth practically and theoreti\xad\ncally. If the lines which connect \nthe corresponding points of the \ndifferent planes are perpendicu\xad\nlar to the planes, and all the streamlines are plane curves which lie entirely in one \nof those planes, we speak of a uniplanar flow. The flow around a strut whose axis is \nperpendicular to the direction of the wind is an example of such a motion.\nThe mathematical treatment of plane potential flow of the ideal fluid has been \nworked out specially completely more than any other problem in hydrodynamics. \nThis is due to the fact that with the help of the complex quantities (x + iy, where i = \n√–1, is called the imaginary unit) there can be deduced from every analytic func\xad\ntion a case of flow of this type which is incompressible and irrotational.

All functions Φ (x, y, z, t), \nwhich satisfy this last equation, represent possible forms of flow. This representa\xad\ntion of a flow is specially convenient for calculations, since by it the entire flow is \ngiven by means of the one function Φ. The most valuable property of the repre\xad\nsentations is, though, that the sum of two, or of as many as one desires, functions \nΦ, each of which satisfies equation (4a), also satisfies this equation and therefore \nrepresents a possible type of flow (“superposition of flows”).\n6. Another concept can be derived from the circulation, which is convenient \nfor many considerations, viz, that of rotation. The component of the rotation with \nreference to any axis is obtained if the circulation is taken around an elementary \nsurface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Expressed more exactly, \nsuch a rotation component is the ratio of the circulation around the edge of any \nsuch infinitesimal surface to the area of the surface. The total rotation is a vector \nand is obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular \naxes. In the case that the fluid rotates like a rigid body, the rotation thus defined \ncomes out as twice the angular velocity of the rigid body. If we take a rectangular \nsystem of axes and consider the rotations with reference to the separate axes, we \nfind that the rotation can also be expressed as the geometrical sum of the angular \nvelocities with reference to the three axes.\nThe statement that in the case of a potential motion the circulation is zero for \nevery closed fluid line can now be expressed by saying the rotation in it is always \nzero. The theorem that the circulation, if it is zero, remains zero under the conditions \nmentioned, can also now be expressed by saying that, if these conditions are satis\xad\nfied in a fluid in which there is no rotation, rotation can never arise. An irrotational \nfluid \nmotion, \ntherefore, \nalways remains irrotational. \nIn this, however, the fol\xad\nlowing exceptions are to be \nnoted: If the fluid is divided \nowing to bodies being pres\xad\nent in it, the theorem under \nconsideration does not apply \nto the fluid layer in which \nthe divided flow reunites, \nnot only in the case of fig\xad\nure 2 but also in the case of Figure 3: Successive positions of a fluid line of flow around a solid body showing flow around a airfoil\nFIGURE 3. Successive positions of a fluid line in flow around a \nsolid\xa0body.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n232\nno ends this external rotation is removed, since one end always coincides with the \nbeginning of another portion of equal strength, and rotation is present only where \nit is predicated in the calculation.\n9. If one wishes to represent the flow around solid bodies in a fluid, one can in \nmany cases proceed by imagining the place of the solid bodies taken by the fluid, in \nthe interior of which disturbances of flow (singularities) are introduced, by which \nthe flow is so altered that the boundaries of the bodies become streamline surfaces. \nFor such hypothetical constructions in the interior of the space actually occupied \nby the body, one can assume, for instance, any suitably selected vortices, which, \nhowever, since they are only imaginary, need not obey the laws of Helmholtz. As \nwe shall see later, such imaginary vortices can be the seat of lifting forces. Sources \nand sinks also, i.e., points where fluid continuously appears, or disappears, offer a \nuseful method for constructions of this kind. While vortex filaments can actually \noccur in the fluid, such sources and sinks may be assumed only in that part of the \nspace which actually is occupied by the body, since they represent a phenomenon \nwhich can not be realized. A contradiction of the law of the conservation of matter \nis avoided, however, if there are assumed to be inside the body both sources and \nsinks, of equal strengths, so that the fluid produced by the sources is taken back \nagain by the sinks.\nThe method of sources and sinks will be described in greater detail when cer\xad\ntain practical problems are discussed; but at this point, to make the matter clearer, \nthe distribution of velocities in the case of a source may be described. It is very sim\xad\nple, the flow takes place out from the source uniformly on all sides in the direction \nof the radii. Let us describe around the point source a concentric spherical surface, \nthen, if the fluid output per second is Q, the velocity at the surface\xa0is\n\tEquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squared\nEquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squaredEquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squared\nQ\n4 π r2 E\t\nquation 7: v = Q over 4 pi r squared\nthe velocity therefore decreases inversely proportional to the square of the distance. \nThe flow is a potential one, the potential comes out (as line-integral along the radius)\n\tEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squared\nEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squaredEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squared\nQ\n4 π r \t\nEquation 7a: Phi = constant minus Q over 4 pi r squared\nIf a uniform velocity toward the right of the whole fluid mass is superimposed \non this velocity distribution—while the point source remains stationary—then a \nflow is obtained which, at a considerable distance from the source, is in straight lines \nfrom left to right. The fluid coming out of the source is therefore pressed toward the \nright (see fig. 5); it fills, at some distance from the source, a cylinder whose diameter \nmay be determined easily. If V is the velocity of the uniform flow, the radius r of \nthe cylinder is given by the condition Q = πrsquared · V. All that is necessary now is to \nassume on the axis of the source further to the right a sink of the same strength as \nthe source for the whole mass of fluid from the source to vanish in this, and the']","

In fluid dynamics, rotation is a measure of the angular motion of fluid particles around a given axis. It is defined as the ratio of the circulation around an elementary surface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis to the area of the surface. The total rotation is a vector obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular axes. In the case of a potential motion, the circulation is zero for every closed fluid line, and therefore, the rotation is always zero. This means that an irrotational fluid motion always remains irrotational. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the fluid is divided by the presence of bodies in it, and the divided flow reunites.

The concept of rotation is significant in fluid motion as it can help predict the behavior of fluid particles in different flow regimes. For example, in figure 3, the successive positions of a fluid line in flow around a solid body show how the rotation of fluid particles changes as they move around the body. The rotation of fluid particles can also affect the stability of fluid motion, as in the case of vortex shedding behind bluff bodies.

In summary, rotation is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that measures the angular motion of fluid particles around a given axis. It is defined as the ratio of the circulation around an elementary surface of unit area in a plane perpendicular to the axis to the area of the surface. The total rotation is a vector obtained from the rotation components for three mutually perpendicular axes. The concept of rotation is significant in fluid motion as it can help predict the behavior of fluid particles in different flow regimes."
"What was the primary focus of the COMPLEX study in terms of Mars exploration?

JPL had acquired an engineering model of the Apollo-era Lunar Rover from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and equipped it with the cameras and other sensors needed to operate autonomously. And in 1978, the JPL team had even gotten it to work, after a fashion. The rover had moved itself a few centimeters in a test that October, taking an entire day to do it. But it had to be hooked up to the largest, fastest mainframe owned by JPL’s parent, the California Institute of Technology—a Digital Equipment Corporation KL10—to do anything at all.

So while the demonstration had been successful in a narrow technical sense, it was widely closer to having the technical capacity to carry out this longstanding scientific goal than it has ever been, it is less able to carry it out than it was just a handful of years ago. 

In terms of Mars exploration, the COMPLEX study argued that both in situ research—science performed from orbit or on the surface of Mars—and returned samples were necessary: “A minimal base of information is necessary to guide the choice of a sample to define and address substantial and important scientific questions in a definitive way and to ensure the acquisition of a sufficient variety of materials, and with adequate documentation.”9 In situ science was necessary to provide this base of information, and to some degree in situ science needed to precede sample return.

The in situ \nmission scenario required “substantial mobility” in order to explore areas \nof 10–100 kilometers. This mobile robot was to have the ability to pick up \nand test samples of rock and soil during its traverse and to provide chemi\xad\ncal analyses and “high-quality macroscopic and microscopic imaging” of its \ncollections. In short, COMPLEX sought a robotic geologist for its in situ mis\xad\nsion. The sample-return mission, in some respects, was more modest. The \nsample-return lander the committee envisioned might need mobility within \n“a selected area of a few meters” but could also be stationary as long as it \ncould choose samples within the small area around it (that is, as long as it \nwould have a Viking-like sampling arm.) The stationary lander also needed \nto have “basic imaging and chemical analytical capabilities”10 so that scien\xad\ntists could choose the best samples.\nOne interesting aspect of this COMPLEX study is that, relative to the sur\xad\nface exploration scenarios, orbital science was deemphasized. The study did \nnot ignore the utility of orbiting platforms. Indeed, some of its priorities, \nsuch as atmospheric science, were explicitly discussed as better performed \nfrom orbit. But the panel chose not to include any specific orbital science sce\xad\nnarios, perhaps due to the tremendous success, and popularity, of the Viking \nlandings the year before.

The White House continued to promote the initiative, \nand although NASA officials continued to act as if it could be revived, it was \neffectively over.26\nGeoff Briggs at NASA Headquarters had converted the Mars Rover \nSample Return Science Working Group into the Mars Science Working \nGroup in mid-1989. The reconstituted group met in August 1990, where a \nmajor topic of discussion was the ramifications of cuts for Mars science. The \nbudget would no longer support a sample-return mission of any description. \nYet sample return was still a top desire of scientists. Only a few years would \nelapse before it reappeared in NASA’s plans.\nSAMPLE RETURN IN THE FASTER, BETTER, CHEAPER ERA\nDuring the 1990s, NASA embarked on new approaches to developing low-\ncost robotic space missions. This period of experimentation is referred to \nas the “faster, better, cheaper” era at the Agency.27 This era resulted in the \nfirst Mars sample-return mission proposal to make it out of the “pre-project” \nstudy phase into project status. That sample-return project did not last long, \nbut several Mars missions undertaken in the 2000s were influenced by it, \nand the Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity mission is an indirect derivative.\nAfter the loss of the Mars Observer in 1993, NASA created its first Mars \nexploration program proposing a funded sequence of missions rather than \nfollowing its old approach—of seeking funding for single missions via \n“new start” proposals. This program was called Mars Surveyor, and it was \nintended to achieve at least one launch every Mars opportunity (i.e., every \n26 months). Surveyor-funded projects were to be launched in 1996 (Mars \nGlobal Surveyor), 1998 (Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander), and \n2001 (an orbiter-lander pair was planned, but only the orbiter, Mars Odyssey, \nwas completed). The Surveyor program was supposed to launch a two-part \nsample-return mission in 2003 and 2005. Given the small budget allocated \nto the Surveyor program, originally about $200 million a year, NASA struc\xad\ntured the sample-return mission as a partnership with the French space \nagency Centre National d’Études Spatiales, or National Center for Space \nStudies (CNES). \nThe sample-return mission architecture developed by NASA and \nCNES in 1998 involved sending a large lander to Mars in 2003, with a \n26.

The primary focus of the COMPLEX study was on in situ exploration and sample return missions to Mars, with a de-emphasis on orbital science. The study envisioned a long-range, semi-autonomous rover for in situ exploration, which could pick up and test samples of rock and soil, and provide chemical analyses and high-quality imaging. For sample return, the study imagined a lander with basic imaging and chemical analytical capabilities, which could choose the best samples for return to Earth. Orbital science was not entirely ignored, but the study did not include any specific orbital science scenarios, possibly due to the success of the Viking landings and the perception that sending another orbiter to Mars might seem retrogressive."

In the clos\xad\ning years of the same century the automobile has long supplanted the horse and the \nfixed wing aircraft has nearly driven the railroads and steamship companies from \nthe long haul passenger business. Travel times have shrunk to minutes-to-hours. \nIn the process of supplanting older transportation systems, these newer approaches \nhave had a profound influence upon the structure of modern societies. Cities have \nexpanded out of 18th century seaports and 19th century railheads, where much of \nthe developed region was within walking distance of the transportation terminals, \ninto tremendous suburbs with attendant reductions in crowding/increased oppor\xad\ntunity for individual home ownership, etc. The existing transportation system ful\xad\nfills a variety of purposes including travel to and from work and stores, and for \nvarious business, service and pleasure related activities. Transportation and related \nactivities currently constitute [on] the order of 1/5 of the U.S. GDP.\nThe present report will center upon future possibilities/options for a specific \nportion of the transportation spectrum, short-to-moderate range, nominally from \n10s to 100s of miles. The current dominant transportation mode for this mission \nis the automobile, which, possibly more than any other single technical achieve\xad\nment, has enabled the current life style enjoyed by the developed nations. In this \nprocess the auto has created massive safety problems and been responsible for the \nexpenditure of truly prodigious sums on roads and bridges, etc. The current status \nof the auto infrastructure is that we continue to clear and pave more of the water\xad\nshed, contributing to flooding, desiccation and the formation of heat islands. Also, \nthe average trip time is increasing due to expansion of the suburbs and increased \ncongestion, causing non-trivial changes in family life as travelers attempt to utilize \nnon-traditional time slots, or suffer long/nonproductive commutes. The interstate \nhighway system is finally finished and is already clearly overburdened and in need \nof very expensive repairs and expansion.\nSociety cannot, easily or otherwise, continue to bear the costs imposed by \nalmost sole reliance upon the automobile for short-to[-]intermediate passenger \ntransport[;] alternatives are necessary for the future—both for the developed societ\xad\nies and those that desire to/are developing. Probably the most commonly advocated \nalternatives involve some form of mass transit, which have, along with tremen\xad\ndous capit[a]l costs, several other drawbacks such as passenger wait time, weather', '861\nDocument 5-53\nDocument 5-53\nDennis Bushnell, “The Personal Helicopter,” \nin The Personal Aircraft—Status and Issues \n(NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA: NASA \nTechnical Memorandum 109174, December 1994), pp. 37–44.\nIn the view of one of NASA’s most visionary aerodynamicists, Dr. Dennis \nBushnell, the massive problems and costs of contemporary automobile use in the \nearly 21st century will virtually dictate that some form of personal air transporta\xad\ntion be tried in the near future. His answer: a combination automobile/helicopter \nor “helo-converticar” that will revolutionize transportation and society by creating \na new form of mass personal mobility. Bushnell believes that in a matter of a decade \nor two, such a hybrid vehicle will become eminently feasible. Different forms of \nadvanced technology will make it successful where all previous concepts for “road\xad\nable aircraft” or “flying cars” failed. Thanks to computer and satellite navigation \nsystems, they should be able to operate safely, effectively, economically—in fact, \nvirtually automatically. A well-designed helo-converticar should also be able to \nmeet all the necessary environmental and nuisance regulations in terms of colli\xad\nsion avoidance, survivability, noise, emissions, ground-vicinity operations, and reli\xad\nability while providing reasonable ride quality, all-weather operation, and minimal \nmaintenance requirements and costs. Such a vehicle will not replace the automobile \nor rail lines for short-distance and other commuter transportation, but it will add to \na healthier mix. Like the ubiquitous Ford Model T of the early years of automobil\xad\nity, a helo-converticar will reduce population density by stimulating expansion over \nmuch greater areas, lessen the tremendous capital investments required for constant \nbuilding and rebuilding of roads and highways, and otherwise revolutionize trans\xad\nportation and society.\nAll of the papers at this 1994 NASA conference titled “The Personal Aircraft” \nproved stimulating, but Bushnell’s did the most to lay out the larger picture of \nAmerica’s and the world’s transportation needs as we move into the 21st century.', '869\nDocument 5-54\nDocument 5-54\nE.

Liberatore’s excellent book Helicopters Before Helicopters (1998)—a provoca\xad\ntive technical analysis of what made the Wright brothers succeed compared with \ndesigners of the earlier helicopter prototypes.\nAt the conclusion of this persuasive article, Liberatore delivers a commen\xad\ntary on what he sees as the role of the helicopters in transportation systems of the \nfuture. Most of his points mirror those we encountered in the previous document \nby NASA’s Dennis Bushnell. Our love of the automobile has put us in a Malthusian \nbind: “The number of cars keeps increasing…but the number of new, desirable \nurban venues is practically constant.” The result is congestion, gridlock, pollution, \nineffective use of more and more time, and “emotional dysfunction.” More and \nmore people moving through the air is the only answer, Liberatore suggests, and \nthe helicopter is the only way to keep our means of transportation personal. Like \nBushnell, Liberatore indicates that mass use of some sort of helo-converticar is \ninevitable, at least in the modern industrialized nations: “When the need becomes \na necessity, the public will accommodate the new aerial system that will one day be \nas comprehensive and pervasive as the present automobile system.”\nAs the authors of this study of aerodynamic development, we can only hope to \nstill be around to document what would indeed amount to the most revolutionary \ndevelopment in mass personal transportation since the Ford Model T.']"," Dr. Dennis Bushnell envisions a future where a combination automobile/helicopter or 'helo-converticar' will revolutionize transportation and society by creating a new form of mass personal mobility.

What are the lines of evidence that suggest comets are falling into the young star HD 172555?,"Carol Grady, Eureka Scientific Inc. and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, along with a team of astronomers, have provided evidence that comets are falling into the young star HD 172555. In 2018, Grady and her team analyzed archival data gathered by the European Southern Observatory and found the chemical fingerprints of calcium imprinted in HD 172555's light, suggesting the presence of comet-like objects. This discovery was followed up by a team of astronomers who used Hubble to conduct a spectrographic analysis in ultraviolet light. Hubble detected fast-moving silicon and carbon gas in the starlight, which is most likely due to material from the comets vaporizing after streaking across the star's disk. The gravitational stirring by an unseen Jupiter-size planet in the foreground may have catapulted the comets into the star, which is the same mechanism that may have transported water to Earth and the other inner planets of our solar system.

This discovery is significant because it provides evidence for the existence of comets around young stars, which can help us understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. It also highlights the importance of studying comets and their impact on other celestial bodies, as demonstrated by the 1994 collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter. In the years leading up to the impact, astronomers were able to make observing plans and prepare for the unexpected events that followed. Similarly, the discovery of comets falling into HD 172555 provides an opportunity for astronomers to refine their understanding of comet dynamics and their impact on young stars.","['Gathering Evidence of a Planet Flinging Comets Into a \nYoung Star \nAs Hubble’s images of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter “These star-grazing \nhelp illustrate, Jupiter sometimes serves as Earth’s protector by blocking or comets may make life\ndeflecting objects that could collide with our planet.

The 1618 comet was the first to be observed with a telescope, \nand astronomers began to understand them as physical objects, rather than \nas omens sent by deities. But comets were also not quite fully accepted as \npermanent features of the cosmos. Johannes Kepler, who in this era demon\xad\nstrated that planetary orbits were calculable as ellipses, believed comets were \nephemeral and moved in straight lines. Other period astronomers believed \nthem eternal, moving in orbits, though not necessarily centered on the Sun.\nEdmond Halley’s 1705 treatise on comets began to solidify elite opinion \naround the idea that at least some comets were repeat visitors. Using a tech\xad\nnique developed by Isaac Newton, he computed orbits for 24 comets that \nhad appeared between 1337 and 1698, and he contended that a single comet \nactually accounted for three of those visits. It had appeared in 1531, 1607, and \n1682. He also predicted its return in late 1758 or early 1759.7 Though Halley \ndid not live to see his comet’s next reappearance, it did return. A German \namateur made the first recorded observation on Christmas evening, 1758.8 \nHalley’s Comet, as we now name it, settled the question about cometary lon\xad\ngevity and rendered these objects relatively predictable members of the cos\xad\nmos. If one could track a comet for the few days or weeks of an apparition, one \ncould generate its orbital characteristics and predict its future motion.\nHalley also had the foresight to wonder what would happen should a comet \nstrike Earth. But he did not strongly pursue the question—perhaps wisely, for \nthe sake of his reputation. The same century in which Halley’s comet predic\xad\ntion was made and confirmed also witnessed the development of the doctrine \nof uniformitarianism within the natural sciences. Uniformitarianism taught \n(in various formulations) that “the present is the key to the past.” It was articu\xad\nlated in 1795 by James Hutton and subsequently popularized (and purged \nof its religious overtones) by John Playfair’s 1802 revival, Illustrations of the \nHuttonian Theory of the Earth.9 Uniformitarianism proposed that the same \nnatural laws and processes operating today have always operated throughout \nEarth history, at the same rate and across the entire planet:\n7.\t\nIbid., pp. 118–119. \n8.\t\nIbid., p. 132. \n9.\t\nMartin J.\xa0S.

These differences are then squared and summed together. \nThe initial preliminary orbit is adjusted, or refined, until the sum of these \nsquares is minimized. Modern computer-generated orbit determination pro\xad\ncesses also include the perturbing effects of the planets and some of the more \nmassive asteroids and relativistic effects. Once a good orbit has been devel\xad\noped based upon optical observations alone, an accurate ephemeris for the \nobject can often be used to predict range and Doppler measurements so that \nradar observations can be made. Radar observations, along with the optical \nobservations, are sometimes available to provide more refined orbits along \nwith ephemerides that are normally accurate well into the future.43\nIn the case of comets, today’s procedures to define an orbit and account for \nnongravitational forces are rooted in ideas stretching back centuries. In the \n19th century, the German astronomer Johann Encke studied the motion of a \nshort-period comet—with an orbital period of only 3.3\xa0years—over the inter\xad\nval from its discovery in 1786 through 1858. He noted that the observed times \nof perihelion passage were consistently a few hours earlier than his predic\xad\ntions. To explain the comet’s early arrivals, Encke suggested that the comet’s \norbital period was decreasing as it moved through the interplanetary resisting \nmedium that was thought to exist at that time. During the 1835 return of \nComet Halley, Friedrich Bessel of the Königsberg Observatory had suggested \nthat, alternatively, the activity of this comet’s nucleus itself could introduce \nrocket-like deviations from its normal course.44 In 1950, Fred Whipple’s \n“dirty snowball” model for a cometary nucleus provided a likely solution to \nthe so-called nongravitational motions of comets.45 For a rotating cometary \nnucleus, the maximum vaporization of the cometary ices would take place at \na position offset from the subsolar point (cometary noon). There would then \nbe a nonradial component of thrust that would either introduce orbital energy \n43.\t D. K. Yeomans, P.\xa0W. Chodas, M.\xa0S. Keesey, S.\xa0J. Ostro, J.\xa0F.

The comet was clearly already friable and \nextremely weak before its breakup, and this perception was reinforced when \nseveral fragments themselves broke apart for no apparent reason after the July \n1992 close approach.65 Several attempts to estimate the pre-breakup diam\xad\neter of the parent comet were made, but the uncertain estimates spanned a \nlarge range from about 1 kilometer to 10 kilometers. The time of capture into \nJupiter orbit is likewise uncertain due to the chaotic nature of the comet’s \nmotion.

A patent-pending device designed for use \nin either a doctor’s office or on a spacecraft allow for the rapid detection of one of these viruses (VZV), \nwhich can lead to earlier treatment and prevent the onset of painful shingles. Microgravity studies on \nthe International Space Station (ISS) help researchers pinpoint genetic triggers for immune responses \nin T-cells, thus leading to future medical treatments on Earth for immunosuppression. Determining \nthe changes that occur to the immune system in space provides the means to develop targeted \ncountermeasures to adverse effects in space, as well as furnishes additional information for targeted \ntreatments on Earth for the development of pharmaceuticals that can suppress immune response to \nhelp manage autoimmune diseases or organ transplants.\nTackling Immune System Dysfunction—\nfrom Multiple Angles\nGetting sick is no fun for anyone, but it especially taxes \ncrew members aboard the ISS. Protecting crew health \nis important as NASA prepares for long-duration, \ndeep-space missions. The human immune system \nis a complex web of biological structures and \nprocesses; decreased activity in one piece of it \ncan change overall disease risk. Studies have shown \nmicrogravity causes modifications in the human \nimmune system. Figuring out why and how this \noccurs could help not only astronauts, but people \naffected by immune dysfunction here on Earth.\nStudies have shown microgravity \ncauses modifications in the human \nimmune system. Figuring out why \nand how this occurs could help \nnot only astronauts, but people \naffected by immune dysfunction \nhere on Earth.\nMany investigations aboard the space station \nhave studied the effect of microgravity on immune \nsystem health. For example, the Functional Immune \ninvestigation analyzes blood and saliva samples to \nidentify changes taking place in crew members’ \nimmune systems during flight, and compares the \ndata with self-reported health information. This unique \nlook at subtle changes in the immune system that may \noccur before symptoms show up, whether in space or \non the ground, may help scientists pinpoint the onset \nof illness so they can suggest monitoring strategies or \ntreatments to boost the immune system—and prevent \nfull-blown infections and diseases.\nT-cells, a type of white blood cell, play a role in \nactivating the body’s immune system. The T-Cell \nActivation in Aging investigation sent T-cells to the \nspace station, then analyzed changes in their gene \nresponse back on the ground to help determine what \ncauses depression of the human immune system \nin microgravity. Results support the development of \nbetter protective measures to keep crews healthy \nduring long space missions, especially those beyond \nEarth orbit, well out of the reach of major medical \nfacilities. Better understanding of immune system \nactivation and suppression also supports improved \ntreatment for autoimmune diseases such as arthritis \nand diabetes, and the natural decline of the immune \nsystem as people age.\nAnother investigation, Integrated Immune, tested \na strategy to measure white blood cell count and \nstress hormones in crew members during spaceflight \nonboard the space station. Researchers found \nincreases in red blood cell count, mean corpuscular \nvolume, hemoglobin, and platelet concentration \non long-duration flights. This suggests that reports \nof reduction in these blood elements represent \nearly adaptation to microgravity, and that spending \nmore time in space may somewhat compensate \nfor those reductions. The monitoring techniques of \nthis investigation have potential benefit in infection \nepidemics and remote locations on Earth, as well. \nMulti-Omics evaluates how the space environment and \nprebiotics affect immune function. This investigation', '44\nin physical fitness and an increase in sensorimotor \nimpairment. These results raise new questions about \nthe role of artificial gravity countermeasures to maintain \nhuman health during long-duration exploration-class \nmissions. (Shiba et al., 2017). Studies have also shown \nthat spaceflight activates lipotoxic pathways (i.e., \nan accumulation of lipid products in cells) in mouse \nliver, initiates a loss of retinol, and creates a possible \nincreased risk of fatty liver disease, thereby opening \nnew research questions surrounding liver metabolism \nand function (Jonscher et al., 2016). \nIn a long-term mouse mission of 91 days, results \nsuggest that the force-producing extensor digitorum \nlongus (EDL) muscle may resist microgravity-induced \natrophy by activating certain inherent compensatory \nand protective pathways (Cancedda et al., 2012). \nThese studies also show an increased sensitivity of \nthe “antigravity” soleus muscle—the muscle responsible \nfor walking and standing activities—adding insight \ninto the mechanisms for resistance of EDL that could \ncontribute to the development of countermeasures \nto muscle loss in space (Sandonà et al., 2012). \nMoreover, analysis of specific bone formation and \nresorption marker expression in these mice suggested \nthat the microgravity-induced bone loss was due to \nboth an increased bone resorption and a decreased \nbone deposition. More specifically, the protection \nobserved in transgenic mice overexpressing the PTN \n(pleiotrophin) protein was likely due to higher osteoblast \nactivity, which aids in bone formation (Tavella et al., \n2012). In mouse cardiovascular studies, mice flown \nto the space station for 8 days showed a decreased \nexpression of calcium channels, which regulate the \ncontractibility of smooth muscle cells in portal veins \nthat carry blood to the liver. A similar effect was \nobserved in rat liver portal vein myocytes cultured on \nthe space station for 8 days, as well as in rats during \nhind-limb suspension on Earth (Dabertrand et al., 2011). \nHuman Studies\nISS research has revealed astonishing similarities \nbetween spaceflight and the aging process through the \nstudy of astronauts’ heart and blood vessels. Constant \nelevation in blood pressure in the brain while in space, \nreduced physical activity, and the constant exposure \nto higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) might impair \nthe ability of blood vessels of the brain to respond to \nchanges in arterial blood pressure and CO2. This was \naccompanied by insulin resistance in some astronauts \nduring spaceflight—an issue that is also observed in \nthe elderly. Walls of the carotid and femoral arteries \nwere found to be significantly thicker (12%) in all \nastronauts after spaceflight. Increase in artery stiffness \nand thickness after 6 months on the space station \ncorresponded with 10 to 20 years of normal aging \nbut was reversed within a few days of return. The same \npattern was seen in isolation studies (e.g., the Mars \n500 study), indicating this may be a stress response \nto confinement rather than an effect of microgravity \n(Arbeille et al., 2016; Hughson et al., 2016). One study \ndemonstrated that an improved rebreathing method \nwas a more accurate tool to properly monitor cardiac \nfunction during spaceflight than measuring blood \npressure at fingertips (Hughson et al., 2017). Further \nevidence from this study also showed that the elevated \nCO2 exposure could be linked to the vision impairment \nintracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome (Hughson et al., \n2017). Studies of astronauts’ core body temperature \nin microgravity during periods of exercise and rest \nhave shown an increase of 1°C, which is significant \nenough to impair physical and cognitive performance \nif not addressed for long-duration exploration missions \nbeyond LEO (Stahn et al., 2017).\nISS crew members report a variety of neurological \nsymptoms that may be related to changes in cerebral \nvenous outflow. Studies on blood flow changes using \nplethysmography confirm that long-duration spaceflights \nlead to a redistribution of venous blood volume and \nshow interesting differences in the amplitude of cardiac \noscillations measured at the level of the neck veins.', '149\nSpace Station Immunology Insights \nfor Earth and Space\nWhen people get sick, their immune systems kick into \ngear to tell their bodies how to heal. T-cells—white \nblood cells that act like tiny generals—order an army \nof immune cells to organize and attack the enemy. \nMicrogravity studies aboard ISS are helping researchers \npinpoint what drives these responses, thereby leading \nto future medical treatments on Earth.\nScientists have known since the early days of human \nspaceflight that living in microgravity suppresses \nthe immune system. During the Apollo Program, \nfor instance, 15 of the 29 astronauts developed an \ninfection either during or right after flight. Forty years \nlater, Leukin results show that immunosuppression \nbegins within the first 60 hours of flight.\nFindings from this investigation, led by Millie Hughes-\nFulford, Ph.D.—a former NASA astronaut and director \nof the Laboratory of Cell Growth at the University of \nCalifornia, San Francisco—enabled researchers to \npinpoint some specific genetic triggers for the go/no-go \nof the immune system responses in the T-cells.\nIt was the first time scientists have been able to show \nthat gravity is making a difference in activation of the \nT-cell. A healthy body depends on these T-cells to give \norders for the immune system to function properly as it \nmarches into battle. However, certain factors such as \nsignal interruption, delayed responses or even outright \ncell death can hinder victory. A suppressed immune \nsystem is like an army with an ineffective leader, \nsignificantly reducing the chances of a successful fight.\nResults revealed that specific genes within T-cells \nshowed down regulation—a decrease in cell \nresponse—when exposed to microgravity. \nThis combined down regulation in the genetics of \nT-cells leads to a reduction in the body’s defense \nagainst infections during spaceflight in various ways. \nFor instance, a reduced pro-inflammatory response \n(i.e., the cell’s protective reaction to initiate healing) \noccurs. Cells also produce fewer cytokines, which are \nthe proteins responsible for signaling communications \nbetween cells. A negative impact to a cell’s ability to \nmultiply, known as mitogenesis (i.e., the chromosomal \nsplitting in a cell nucleus necessary for cell \nreproduction), also occurs. \nResults revealed that specific \ngenes within T-cells showed \ndown regulation—a decrease in \ncell response—when exposed \nto microgravity. Photo of astronaut Andre Kuipers working with equipment in a rectangular box region of the International Space Station.\nExpedition 30 Flight Engineer Andre Kuipers, \nESA, works with the Kubik facility in the Columbus \nModule of the ISS.\nImage credit: NASA\nExamples of immunosuppression on Earth include the \nAcquired Immune Definiciency Syndrome (AIDS)-related \nHIV infection, rheumatoid arthritis and even age-related \nimpacts to the immune system, which is why the elderly \nhave a difficult time fighting off infections such as \npneumonia. Identifying how the immune system works \nat the cellular level provides a powerful tool to develop \ntreatments at the root of the defense response. This is \nsimilar to a negotiation for peace talks before conflict \nbreaks out, instead of trying to raise a white flag in the \nmidst of an already raging battle. If doctors can isolate \nand control specific immune responses, they increase \nthe chance for recovery. With the removal of gravity \nas its own variable, the data gathered from immune \nstudies in space can be used to help understand some \nof the immune challenges seen in these populations \non Earth.\nHughes-Fulford launched a follow-on immunology \nstudy aboard the space station.

Question: What was the role of NASA in the development of the SST?,"NASA's involvement in the development of the SST began in 1960 when the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DOD), Thomas S. Gates, Jr., and the administrators of NASA and the FAA, T. Keith Glennan and Elwood R. Quesada, respectively, issued a joint recommendation to initiate a national program for the development of a commercial SST. The reasons for this recommendation were many. The creation of an SST was in the national interest because it would guarantee American leadership in commercial aviation, which was vital to the Nation’s economy, security, and prestige. The technical foundation was there with the long tradition of supersonic research in the United States that had culminated with the recent B-58 and B-70 bomber programs. The research and development cost of any SST would be beyond the capabilities of a single company and airline to support. The sheer magnitude of the project required Government leadership, funding, and technical expertise combined with the participation of industry. They predicted that supersonic transports, “either of foreign or of United States origin,” would dominate worldwide commercial air transport service. NASA's involvement in the SST program was to focus on acquiring SST-related flight data involving such issues as sonic boom ground overpressures, autopilot performance as the aircraft transited varying atmospheric pressures and dynamic conditions, and cruise efficiencies and performance. Much research was done on analyzing inlet performance. During the transition from subsonic to supersonic flight, the presence of airflow distortion and turbulence induced compressor stall. The other specter was the reduction of noise. Experimentation on the XB-70A led to better understanding of propulsion and airframe integration, especially regarding mixed compression inlets, used on the design of other supersonic air­craft. Flights of the XB-70 also contributed to the growing body of information available to the National Sonic Boom Program, which confirmed the imprac­ticability of allowing SSTs to operate over the continental United States.","['NASA Gets to Work, 1958–1975\n51\nhad revolutionized international air transport in the piston era, and then in the \nearly turbojet era.

NASA \nestablished the Supersonic Cruise Aircraft Research (SCAR) Program in late \n1971. Langley managed the overall project. In the new NASA model, con\xad\ntracts went out to manufacturers and the NASA Centers supplemented their \nwork with focused studies. The SCAR propulsion effort at Lewis consisted of \ntwo\xa0programs.\nThe first program, the main engine-related project, was the variable-cycle \nengine (VCE). It addressed the noise and emissions problems of the GE4 by \nexhibiting the best characteristics of both a turbojet and a turbofan. Turbojets \nwere most efficient at supersonic speeds but were loud and inefficient at sub\xad\nsonic speeds. Conversely, turbofans offered subsonic efficiency and lower noise \nbut were less efficient at higher Mach numbers. A VCE offered both configu\xad\nrations. Both Pratt & Whitney and GE received development contracts, and \nthe interplay between Lewis, the military, and manufacturers resulted in two \ndifferent engine designs.14 Reflecting the importance of computer simulation \nand modeling embodied in the emerging field of computational fluid dynamics \n(CFD) to predict aerodynamic behavior, Lewis researcher Larry Fishbach facili\xad\ntated the use of a new design code with the Naval Air Development Center. \nThis code, called the Navy-NASA Engine Program, simulated the proposed \ntechnical scenarios for the engine designs.15\nThe second program, the Experimental Clean Combustor Program (ECCP), \nemerged in response to the anticipated introduction of Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) airport emissions standards (and is discussed in more \ndepth in chapter 3). Tests of the experimental engines took place from 1978 \nuntil the termination of SCAR in 1981. Economic inflation, Federal budget', '50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n76\nThere were no official bodies duly appointed to represent the interests of its \nmembership. The closest thing to a recognized organization was the Upper \nAtmosphere Rocket Research Panel (UARRP), formed by a group of sci\xad\nentists to better coordinate their research and limited resources. As these \nresearchers learned more about this previously unexplored realm, space \nresearch increased in complexity, and the coordinating group became more \nambitious, culminating in the planning and execution of the International \nGeophysical Year.\nAs the U.S. government became more interested in space, Congress and \nthe White House sought out a community of knowledgeable experts whose \nexperience and opinions could guide U.S. policy on early space efforts. \nEvidence suggests that Congress and President Dwight Eisenhower’s Science \nAdvisory Committee held the recommendations of the UARRP in high \nregard.71 Many of the panel’s recommendations found their way into the text \nof the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, centralizing space explo\xad\nration in an institution responsible for exploring the atmosphere and space \nimmediately surrounding Earth, as well as the solar system beyond—and, \nwhen appropriate, coordinating that research with international partners.\nWith the formation of NASA, the National Research Council (the \nbody within the National Academy of Sciences—and later the National \nAcademies—primarily responsible for conducting studies) established the \nSpace Science Board. NASA, along with the National Science Foundation \nand the Department of Defense, agreed to pay the National Research \nCouncil for specific studies from the SSB on the direction and effectiveness \nof the nation’s scientific activities in space. Initially, the authority of the SSB \nin planning NASA activities was not clear, and the board pushed to have a \ndetermining input in mission selection, while NASA preferred to keep that \nfunction internal.\nThus, in the early decades of the relationship between the two organiza\xad\ntions, the SSB rarely delved into NASA’s programmatic territory. By the late \n1960s, the relationship had changed, as NASA began to request SSB stud\xad\nies evaluating overarching research strategy while also engaging the plan\xad\netary science community on programmatic issues through the Lunar and \nPlanetary Missions Planning Board. Since 1977, NASA has maintained a link \nto the broader space science community by inviting non-NASA scientists to \nparticipate in NASA Advisory Council (NAC) functions, but the SSB also \n71.\t Newell, Beyond the Atmosphere. See https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4211/ch9-4.htm.', 'NACA to NASA to Now\n146\nIn 1991 NASA formally established Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) as a \ncomprehensive program for studying Earth from space. It emphasized the inte\xad\ngration of data from various Earth observing instruments and programs to gain \na greater understanding of Earth’s natural processes on a global scale. The per\xad\nspective provided new levels of precision to the evaluation of pressure fronts and \nair masses that are so critical in weather forecasting. Likewise, meteorological \nresearch beyond weather forecasting took on new life as climatological research \ncontributed significant insights to our understanding of Earth. \nBy 2000, Earth system science had matured, and throughout the 21st century \na variety of Earth observing spacecraft have enabled scientists to obtain sophis\xad\nticated data about this planet’s physical characteristics. Among others, these \nspacecraft included the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the \nSea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) mission, the QuikScat and \nTOPEX/Poseidon ocean studies missions, and the Active Cavity Radiometer \nIrradiance Monitor Satellite (ACRIMSAT) and Upper Atmosphere Research \nSatellite (UARS) missions. Instruments from these satellites have measured \natmospheric chemistry, biomass burning, and land-surface changes rang\xad\ning from Greenland to the tropical Pacific Ocean. Together, these spacecraft \nhave transformed our understanding of Earth. Cooperatively, they have shown \nchanges in the atmosphere, land, and oceans, as well as their interactions with \nsolar radiation and with one another.\nThe Global Warming Debate\nBy the early part of the 1990s, the emerging discipline of Earth system science \nhad become part of the lexicon and had already made inroads into the pub\xad\nlic consciousness. It took on added significance as debates over global climate \nchange, sometimes referred to as “global warming,” became more politicized as \nthe decade progressed. Some opponents of regulation were irate about the use of \nscientific studies by government officials as justification for restrictive protocols \nthat circumscribed their actions. Those opposed to change focused on question\xad\ning the science on which the government has based its actions. \nThis effort found expression in one of the most difficult situations NASA \nhas ever faced. In 2005 some NASA officials attempted to silence scientific \nfindings about global climate change. This began as a tragicomic effort of some \npolitical appointees to control scientists associated with the federal government \nby keeping them from taking positions on hot-button issues, especially global \nwarming. NASA scientist James R. Hansen was a central participant in this \ncontroversy. He had been involved in research about global warming since the \n1970s, and his organization, NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in', '49\nCHAPTER 2\u2002 •\u2002 Funding Planetary Science: History And Political Economy \nTHE 1960SGraph showing NASA budgets from 1959 through 1969 with the solar system exploration missions launched for each year.\nFIGURE 12.

In 1959, SSB Executive Director Hugh \nOdishaw and Chairman Lloyd Berkner fought for a more active role in \nNASA’s programmatic direction. Their efforts were rebuffed by Homer \nNewell, NASA’s assistant director for space science, and Hugh Dryden, \nDeputy Administrator of the Agency. The National Academy of Sciences \n13.\t Able IVA, Able IVB, Able VA, and Able VB were also known as Pioneer P-1, Pioneer P-3, \nPioneer P-30, and Pioneer P-31, respectively. Pioneers 6, 7, 8, and 9 measured the solar wind \nflow, magnetic fields, and electron density in space, and they observed the energy spectra, \nfluxes, and direction of solar and galactic cosmic rays. Pioneer E was a similar mission but \nwas lost in a launch failure. Arguably, these were space physics missions, not planetary \nscience missions. In the FY 1968 and FY 1969 budgets, NASA moved the Pioneer program \nfrom the Lunar and Planetary Exploration line to the Astronomy and Space Science line. In \nall other years, the Pioneer program fell under the Lunar and Planetary Exploration line, so \nthe missions are counted as planetary missions here.']"," NASA played a significant role in the development of the Supersonic Transport (SST). In the early 1960s, NASA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the support of President John F. Kennedy, initiated a design competition between leading aircraft manufacturers. NASA was already involved in a Nationwide effort to create a practical American SST, similar to its work with the space program. In December 1966, the Government chose Boeing's Model 2707 design, and General Electric received the contract for its four engines, designated GE4. NASA was responsible for ensuring that the engines for the new SST were as fuel-efficient, quiet, and reliable as standard airliner engines at both supersonic and subsonic speeds, including takeoff, landing, and loitering in a holding pattern."
What is the current state of airship technology and how does it compare to airplane development?,"The text material suggests that airship technology is lagging behind airplane development due to the small number of airships built and limited opportunities for development. However, there have been improvements in materials and methods of construction for new airships whenever they are begun. The text also mentions that the technical development of airships continues to lag behind that of airplanes, but the satisfactory methods for the protection of duralumin against corrosion and the obtaining of substitutes for goldbeater's skin fabric are notable results. The text also notes that the large cost of rigid airships and the fact that only one is now available forced a cautious, conservative scheme of operation, which has not as yet allowed the technique of rigid airship operation to develop to the full extent of its possibilities. The text suggests that the shortage of helium and meager facilities for its transportation and storage have retarded the operation of rigid airships at intervals. However, there have been improvements in weather information service, and arrangements and mechanical appliances for landing airships and handling them on the ground, and in or out of sheds, are being improved with experience. Overall, the text suggests that while airship technology has made progress, it is still behind airplane development.","['81\nDocument 5-2 (a–s)\nrigid airships has progressed to the point where we are justified in believing that \nlarge rigid airships can be constructed and operated successfully.\nResolved further, That it is the opinion of the National Advisory Committee for \nAeronautics that the most practical step to be taken at the present time to encour\xad\nage the development of an airship industry in the United States is to begin the \nconstruction of the airships authorized under the 5-year aircraft building program. \nThe construction of these airships will foster the development of an airship indus\xad\ntry, and this, with the knowledge to be acquired from experience in the operation \nof airships, will be necessary in order to enable the United States to meet the needs \nfor commercial airship construction and operation when they arise.\nThe committee appends hereto a memorandum entitled “The Present Status of \nthe Development of Rigid Airships in the United States,” which states the facts on \nwhich its opinion is based.\nSincerely yours,\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,\nJoseph S. Ames, Chairman.\nThe memorandum enclosed with the committee’s letter follows:\nTHE PRESENT STATUS OF THE DEVELOPMENT\nOF RIGID AIRSHIPS IN THE UNITED STATES\nCONSTRUCTION\nNo rigid airship has been built in this country since the Shenandoah was com\xad\npleted in 1923, but theoretical studies, research and practical tests have contin\xad\nued so that ultimately additional rigid airships might be designed and built in the \nUnited States. As a result, the United States is today as fully abreast of rigid airship \ndevelopment as could be expected without actual construction since 1923.\nThe Shenandoah was a remodeled copy of a 1916 German design and, when \ncompleted, was recognized as an admirable first American effort rather than \nas a modern rigid airship. The necessity for providing suitable materials for the \nShenandoah led to the further development of aluminum alloys and brought to the \nUnited States expert talent who knew how to manufacture gas cells. Additional \ntechnical experts were brought to this country who were familiar with rigid airship \nfabrication, erection, and operation. Original thought and effort were expended \nalong various lines connected with theoretical design, with the result that in spite of \nmeager information as to the prototype[,] the design of the Shenandoah was placed \nupon a sound basis. A special subcommittee of the National Advisory Committee \nfor Aeronautics checked the design and found it reasonable. Recent information \nconfirms this opinion.\nThe Shenandoah was operated successfully by the Navy for two years. Her \noperation proved the practicability of mooring masts ashore and afloat.

This is only to be expected in view of \nthe small numbers of airships which are built and the very limited opportunity for \ndevelopment of new ideas and methods of construction which are presented. No \nnew airship construction has been begun in the United States. Attention has been \nconfined to the replacement of parts of existing nonrigid airships.\nA design competition was held by the Navy Department looking toward the \nprocurement of the best designs for the 6,000,000-cubic-foot airships which have \nbeen authorized by Congress as a part of the Navy Department “five-year aviation \nprogram.” A number of designs were submitted, among them a very satisfactory \none, and negotiations toward a contract for the construction of one airship gen\xad\nerally according to this design are under way. This design includes a number of \nfeatures which, while novel as far as actual incorporation in airships is concerned, \nhave been commonly discussed in that connection for many years.\nExperimental investigation and research for the purpose of improving existing \nairships and providing improved materials and methods of construction for new \nairships whenever they are begun has continued[,] although at a decreased rate. \nThe satisfactory methods for the protection of duralumin against corrosion and \nprogress made in the obtaining of substitutes for goldbeater’s skin fabric are the \nmost notable results.\nWork with the “Los Angeles.”—The Los Angeles has been maintained in splendid \ncondition and undoubtedly has several years of useful and active life before it. It \nhas been used frequently in research on problems connected with the design and \noperation of rigid airships. One of the most important problems was the determi\xad\nnation of the effect on the speed of the airship of fitting water recovery apparatus. \nFor this purpose a series of deceleration tests was carried out on the airship both \nwith and without the water recovery apparatus. The resistance coefficients of the \nfull-sized airship were thus determined and the effect of the added apparatus was \naccurately\xa0determined.\nThe operating personnel of the Los Angeles has been continuously active in the \nimprovement of methods for handling airships on the ground and in and out of the \nshed. The enlisted and officer personnel engaged in this work have been very highly \ncomplimented by persons who have observed the manner in which this airship has \nbeen handled by the methods now in use. As a result of study by the personnel at \nLakehurst there has been developed a method using a mobile telescopic mast and a \nlarge amount of mechanical equipment which it is expected will make it possible to \nreduce the number of men required for landing and handling the airship to a very', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n72\nDocument 5-2 (c), “Helium and Airships,” NACA Annual Report (1921), p. 5.\nHELIUM AND AIRSHIPS\nThe United States has a virtual monopoly of the known sources of supply of \nhelium, and these are limited. Experiments have been conducted by the Bureau of \nMines with a view to the development of methods of production and storage, but \nas yet the problem of storage in large quantities has not been satisfactorily solved. \nBecause the known supply is limited, because it is escaping into the atmosphere \nat an estimated rate sufficient to fill four large airships weekly, and because of \nthe tremendously increased value and safety which the use of helium would give \nto airships, particularly in warfare, it is, in the opinion of the National Advisory \nCommittee for Aeronautics, the very essence of wisdom and prudence to provide \nfor the conservation of large reserves through the acquisition and sealing by the \nGovernment of the best helium-producing fields. Attention now being given to the \ndevelopment of types of airships to realize fully the advantages which the use of \nhelium would afford should be continued. Such development would give America \nadvantages, for purposes either of war or commerce, with which no other nation \ncould successfully compete.\nDocument 5-2 (d), “Airship Development,” \nNACA Annual Report (1921), pp. 21–22.\nAIRSHIP DEVELOPMENT\nGermany and England have produced the best demonstrations of the poten\xad\ntial value of rigid airships, both for military and commercial purposes. Germany, \nin particular, has demonstrated the practicability of commercial airship passenger \nservice. The French Government has laid out a progressive program of develop\xad\nment. France has two rigid airships of the Zeppelin type, which were acquired from \nGermany through the Reparations Commission. The present French program calls \nfor the early inauguration of a commercial airship line from Marseille or Toulon to \nAlgiers. In Italy, the semirigid type of airship has been developed, both for military \nand commercial purposes.\nAmerica’s first program of airship development contemplated the procuring by \nthe Navy of a rigid airship from England—the ill-fated R-38, known in this coun\xad\ntry as the ZR-2; the procuring by the Army of the Italian semirigid airship Roma; \nand the construction by the Navy at Lakewood[,] N.J., of the first American rigid \nairship, to be known as the ZR-1.\nThe disaster to the ZR-2 in Great Britain before delivery to this country \nthreatened for a time the discontinuance of airship development in America. The \nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, in a special resolution addressed to', '83\nDocument 5-2 (a–s)\noperation at a time, competitive effort has not been possible. Development would \nbe faster if more rigid airships were available. The large cost of rigid airships and the \nfact that only one is now available forced a cautious, conservative scheme of opera\xad\ntion which, though sound, has not as yet allowed the technique of rigid airship \noperation to develop to the full extent of its possibilities. This situation will correct \nitself when more airships and better facilities are available.\nThe facilities for the operation of rigid airships in the United States are not \nthe best and additional facilities are needed. There are only two large sheds—\nat Lakehurst and at Scott Field. The former in particular is poorly located from \na meteorological standpoint. The shortage of helium and meager facilities for its \ntransportation and storage have retarded the operation of rigid airships at intervals. \nSeveral mooring masts have been erected at strategic points, but the masts remote \nfrom the shed base have been used only once.\nArrangements and mechanical appliances for landing airships and handling \nthem on the ground, and in or out of sheds, are being improved with experience. \nAs a result we should be prepared to handle the larger airships now contemplated \nwith no more difficulty, and perhaps with less difficulty, than airships of the Los \nAngeles size. There has been gratifying progress in developing the floating mast, the \nfixed stub mast, the mobile stub mast, mechanically operated docking trolleys, cars \nfor supporting airships while moving in and out of sheds, [an] artificial superheat \ndevice, remote control for hauling down winches and the deck landing platform.\nThe operation of airships, like airplanes, is influenced by weather conditions \nand will be facilitated by improved weather information service. A new system for \nthe collection and distribution of weather reports has recently been worked out by \nthe Weather Bureau in cooperation with the telegraph companies. This will much \nfacilitate the prompt furnishing of aerological information so necessary for the safe \nnavigation of the air.\nFOREIGN DEVELOPMENT\nNo survey of rigid airship development would be complete without a résumé of \nwhat is being done by other nations.\nGermany, the original home of the rigid airship, and where it finds most enthu\xad\nsiastic support, is just completing a 3,650,000 cubic foot airship, funds for which \nwere raised largely by popular subscription. It is proposed that this airship, after \nmaking demonstration flights, including one to the United States, will be used to \nstart a commercial line between Spain and South America. The design is a modern \nand enlarged copy of the Los Angeles. This airship will carry a large portion of its \nfuel in gaseous form. This permits an important increase in cruising range. This \ndevelopment is being watched with interest[,] and a combination of helium and a \nfuel gas offers attractive possibilities without much greater risk than with helium \nalone and gasoline.']","
The technical development of airships continues to lag behind that of airplanes, which is expected due to the smaller number of airships built and limited opportunities for new ideas and methods of construction. No new airship construction has been started in the United States, with attention focused on replacing parts of existing nonrigid airships. A design competition was held by the Navy Department for 6,000,000-cubic-foot airships, and negotiations for the construction of one airship based on a satisfactory design are underway. This design includes novel features that have been discussed for many years. Experimental investigation and research to improve existing airships and develop new ones have continued but at a decreased rate. The most notable results include satisfactory methods for protecting duralumin against corrosion and progress in obtaining substitutes for goldbeater's skin fabric. The Los Angeles airship has been maintained in excellent condition and used for research on various problems related to rigid airships, such as determining the effect of water recovery apparatus on speed. The operating personnel have been active in improving ground handling methods, reducing the number of men required for landing and handling the airship."
What was the purpose of flying the XV-15 behind and in close formation to the Lockheed YO-3A research aircraft?,"The purpose of flying the XV-15 behind and in close formation to the Lockheed YO-3A research aircraft was to obtain comparable free flight noise data during a special flight investigation required to evaluate a flight investigation involving flying the XV-15 behind and in close formation to a quiet research aircraft (the Lockheed YO-3A) equipped with microphones and recording equipment. By maintaining the YO-3A microphone location at a fixed distance and position with respect to the XV-15 proprotor, and by operating at the same prop­rotor operating condition, a direct comparison (with corrections for the second proprotor) between the flight data and wind tunnel test data was obtained. This experiment was conducted by Ames researchers in September 1982 and again in April 1986 with support from Bell. The NASA-operated radar-coupled laser tracker was also used during these tests to explore the sound generated during flyover or terminal approach conditions.","['815\nDocuments 5-49 (a–d)\ncould be used to significantly reduce the noise level and footprint area during tilt \nrotor\xa0approaches.\nIn December 1995, with plans being developed for an acoustics test of the \nXV-15 metal-bladed proprotor in the acoustically treated test section of the Ames \n80- by 120-foot wind tunnel, a special flight investigation was required to obtain \ncomparable free flight noise data to determine the effect of the wind tunnel walls \non the measured sound. The evaluation involved flying the XV-15 behind, and in \nclose formation to[,] a quiet research aircraft (the Lockheed YO-3A) which was \nequipped with microphones and recording equipment. By maintaining the YO-3A \nmicrophone location at a fixed distance and position with respect to the XV-15 \nproprotor (shown in figure 60) [not reproduced] corresponding to a microphone \nlocation in the test section of the wind tunnel, and by operating at the same prop\xad\nrotor operating condition, a direct comparison (with corrections for the second \nproprotor) between the flight data and wind tunnel test data was obtained. This \nexperiment was conducted by Ames researchers. The tests involved a Bell flight \ncrew in the XV-15, and a NASA flight crew in the YO-3A.\nCOMPOSITE PROPROTOR BLADES\nFrom the very beginning of the TRRA project the proprotor blades were of \nspecial concern to the Government Project Office. The metal blades used on the \nXV-15 were designed in the late 1960s under Bell’s IR&D funding for the predeces\xad\nsor tilt rotor aircraft, the Bell Model 300. This aircraft had a design gross weight \nof 12,400 pounds, 600 pounds lighter than that of the XV-15. The concern was \nthat the proprotors would be too highly loaded, i.e. operating too close to aero\xad\ndynamic stall, to provide adequate reserve thrust for control when operating in \nhover at high gross weights. This could result in a reduction of control effectiveness \nor the need for a substantial increase in power when operating at the high gross \nweight\xa0condition.\nFlight tests of the XV-15, however, did not indicate deficiencies. The metal \nbladed proprotor, although sized for a smaller aircraft, performed well at all XV-\n15 operating weights and flight conditions. While performance was satisfactory, \nanother problem emerged that could threaten the future of the XV-15. This was the \npossibility that one or more blades could become unserviceable or unflightworthy \ndue to mishandling or deterioration of the blade’s structural integrity.\nConcern centered on the aft blade section, an aerodynamic fairing constructed \nof a lightweight aluminum honeycomb core covered with a thin steel skin (figure\xa061) \n[not reproduced]. Over the first few years of aircraft operations, minor surface dam\xad\nage was incurred due to ground handling. More significantly, small areas of separa\xad\ntion of the bond between the skin and the honeycomb was [sic] detected on several \nblades. While the size of these “voids” was monitored during frequent inspections, \nthe discovery of a rapid growth in size or an unacceptably large separation area', 'Chapter 5: Other Paths, Other Flyways\n59\nthe XV-3, had two three-bladed rotors that could convert from helicopter mode to \nstraight and level flight like an airplane. Aeroelastic (i.e., flutter) problems plagued \nits rotor blades, leading to accidents—but not before the machine made the world’s \nfirst conversion of a tilting prop-rotor aircraft in 1958. Bell persisted with the tilt-\nrotor concept, building a second XV-3 and defining several other possible tilt-rotors. \nThis commitment eventually led to Model 301, which became the renowned XV-\n15. (Document 5-49 offers a retrospective account of NASA’s involvement in the \nXV-3 program and its follow-on to the XV-15.) In the 1970s, a test program with \nthe XV-15 fully demonstrated the viability of tilt-rotor operation and led in 1983 to \nthe design of the V-22 “Osprey,” the product of a joint program between Bell and \nBoeing with assistance from NASA. Although kinks still needed to be worked out, \nso impressive was the performance of the several test and preproduction Ospreys \nthat the United States Navy and Marine Corps decided in 1997 to put the air\xad\ncraft into production. With funding for continued tilt-rotor R&D behind it, Bell \nannounced that same year that it was planning to build a civilian tilt-rotor, one that \ncould transport as many as nine executive passengers at a speed of 315 mph over a \nmaximum distance of 860 miles.\nFor NASA, tilt-rotor R&D often went on hand in hand with efforts to develop \nadvanced helicopters. Much of its work on rotor-systems technology took place in \nassociation with the U.S. Army. In the late 1960s, the Army established the Army \nAeronautical Research Laboratory (AARL) at NASA Ames, a main part of which \nfocused both on advanced helicopter and tilt-rotor concepts. A new Center Director \nat Ames, Dr. Hans Mark, moved aggressively to attract money and other support \nfor research on short-haul aircraft, including V/STOL designs. In 1971, NASA \nestablished a V/STOL Projects Office at Ames; a year later, a Tilt Rotor Research \nAircraft Project Office came to life there. In 1976, NASA Headquarters named \nAmes its “lead center” in helicopter research—much to the chagrin of Langley, \nwhich had gotten more heavily involved in all sorts of V/STOL as well, including \nhelicopters. In 1978, Ames began testing Bell’s XV-15 in the 40- by 80-foot wind \ntunnel. In-flight demonstrations of this big tilt-rotor prototype began at Ames and \nat NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) \nin 1980. A complete (mostly firsthand) history of the NACA/NASA involvement \nin tilt-rotor research leading up and through the XV-15 research aircraft program \nis provided in Martin D. Maisel, Demo J. Giulianetti, and Daniel C. Dugan, The \nHistory of the XV-15 Tilt Rotor Research Aircraft: From Concept to Flight (2000), selec\xad\ntions from which compose Document 5-49. Document 5-50 reproduces excerpts \nfrom a December 1981 paper by J.\xa0C. Narramore of Bell Helicopter Textron titled \n“Advanced Technology Airfoil Development for the XV-15 Tilt-Rotor Vehicle.” \nDuring the same time period that NASA and Bell were actively pursuing tilt-rotor \nsystems, European companies also began exploring the technology. In 1986, sev\xad\neral of them created a consortium called Eurofar to build a commercial tilt-rotor \ntransport. Eurofar designed an aircraft that looked a lot like the V-22 Osprey but', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n810\nIt was determined (for the XV-15 at its maximum takeoff gross weight, and at \napproximately 60 percent of the normal power) that the optimum nacelle position \nfor minimum ground roll to clear a 50-foot obstacle was 75 degrees. Evaluations \nof this type verified the capability of the tiltrotor aircraft to perform short takeoffs \nat gross weights well above its vertical takeoff gross weight, adding an important \nperformance capability to this new aircraft type.\nAs often happens in developmental work, a totally unforeseen incident involv\xad\ning a critical proprotor hub component occurred during the STO tests. This com\xad\nponent, called the “yoke,” to which the blades are attached, was manufactured of \nTitanium because it afforded valuable weight saving over steel while still providing \nthe required fatigue life.\nOn October 1, 1982, while performing STO operations at the Crows Landing \nNALF, at the XV-15’s maximum takeoff gross weight, a telephone call was received \nby the Ames test director[,] Shorty Schroers, from engineers at the Bell facility in \nTexas. They informed Schroers that they had just discovered that the strength of \nTitanium material used for the rotor yokes was significantly lower than that used in \ntheir design. The flight crew was informed about this new and somewhat disturb\xad\ning development while in flight. They landed the XV-15 safely and removed the \nweights added for the STO tests. After further consultation with Bell engineers, it \nwas decided to “gingerly” fly the aircraft back to Ames taking special care to keep \nthe hub yoke oscillatory loads at a low level.\nThe full story regarding the Titanium fatigue strength anomaly emerged later. \nWhile performing design work for another project, a Bell engineer came across a \npublished fatigue strength allowable load level for Titanium that was lower than \nthat used for the design of the XV-15 yokes. Although the Titanium identified by \nthe Bell engineer and the Titanium used for the proprotor were the same, a differ\xad\nence existed in their fatigue strength because of heat treatment (a process by which \nthe strength and other properties of metals are altered by exposure to specific ther\xad\nmal conditions). As luck would have it, the heat treatment for the Titanium used \nfor the XV-15 yokes was the one which resulted in the lower fatigue strength. This \nmeant that aircraft N703NA had been operating at significantly higher loads than \nthe lower strength Titanium could bear for the duration of the flight program.\nOperation of both XV-15 aircraft was continued but with the installation of \na new set of Titanium yokes and with the allowable loads reduced until a better \nsolution was found. The solution was replacement of the Titanium yokes with steel \nyokes of the same design. Steel yokes were installed on aircraft N703NA in July of \n1985 and have been used continuously since then without incident.\nFLOW VISUALIZATION STUDIES\nIn the early 1980s, a number of tilt rotor technical issues remained unexplained. \nOne of these was that acoustic measurements in the hover mode of flight revealed', '813\nDocuments 5-49 (a–d)\nIn July 1985, an intensive flight evaluation of a three-axis sidestick controller \nwas performed in XV-15 N703NA. During a nine day period, a total of 13 flights \nwere flown with eight pilots from six agencies (the NASA, Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Bell Helicopter Textron, and Boeing Helicopters). Control characteristics \nof the center stick and the sidestick controller were compared. Each pilot received \na familiarization flight in the left seat using a conventional center stick control \nand flew an evaluation flight in the right seat which was equipped with a sidestick \ncontroller. Without exception, all of the evaluation pilots found the sidestick to \nbe a viable controller and that the aircraft was safe to fly with a degraded control \nsystem (i.e. with the SCAS turned off). The pilots even reported that some tasks \ncould be performed with more precision with the sidestick controller than with the \nconventional center stick.\nWhile the sidestick investigation successfully achieved its objectives, the V-22 \nOsprey was nonetheless configured with a center stick control. However, the side\xad\nstick controller continues to be considered by the V-22 Project Office for future \napplication to the tilt rotor aircraft.\nACOUSTICS\nBy the late 1970s, communities adjacent to airports and heliports had become \nquite sensitive to the noise generated by aircraft operations, in particular, to the \ndisturbing character of the sound of rotorcraft noise. Therefore, if the tilt rotor were \nto be used as a civil transport aircraft, it was important to document its noise in the \nterminal area. In addition, it was necessary to establish a tilt rotor noise database \nfor various flight modes and operating conditions for use in the development of \nprediction methodology. The XV-15 became the test bed for a wide range of tilt \nrotor acoustics studies.\nSome very limited initial noise data were obtained with the XV-15 at Bell and \nconsisted of only a few data points acquired during early hover tests. The next \nopportunity to measure tilt rotor noise occurred during hover performance testing \nat Ames in February and March 1981. An array of 16 microphones was distributed \naround a selected hover point to fully document the noise around the aircraft. The \nresulting acoustic data (refer to footnote 34) [not included] surprisingly showed that \nthe noise varied by a few decibels around the aircraft, rather than remaining nearly \nconstant. An explanation was later provided by Professor Al George of Cornell \nUniversity[,] who postulated that this was caused by the reingestion of the turbu\xad\nlent fountain flow (revealed during the flow visualization test) into the proprotor \nover the root end of the wing.\nSeveral subsequent tests were conducted to explore the sound generated dur\xad\ning flyover or terminal approach conditions. The first was conducted at Crows \nLanding in September 1982 by a NASA/Army team and again in April 1986 with \nsupport from Bell. The NASA[-]operated radar-coupled laser tracker was used', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n794\nDocuments 5-49 (a–d)\nSelections from Martin D. Maisel, Demo J. Giulianetti, and \nDaniel C.

Between July 1957 and October 1958, Ames not only helped to \nflight-test the experimental tilt-rotor but also put its full-scale performance behav\xad\nior through exhaustive tests in the lab’s mammoth 40- by 60-foot wind tunnel. \nResults indicated the need for several improvements, which, once they were made, \nenabled the XV-3 to accomplish “the elusive goal of completing a dynamically sta\xad\nble full conversion to the airplane mode” (Maisel et al., p. 114). Ames personnel \nremained active with the XV-3 program into the late 1960s, when Bell ended the \nprogram after clearly demonstrating the feasibility of the tilt-rotor concept, though \nwith limited hover capability and cruise performance by the XV-3 itself.\nThe following four selections provide insights into the history of NASA’s \ntilt-rotor research from the XV-3 program of the late 1950s, through the XV-15 \nof the 1970s, to the design of the V-22 Osprey in the 1980s from three NASA \nengineers who participated actively in the research programs. Martin Maisel (B.S. \nin aeronautical engineering, 1960, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn) became a \nmember of the NASA-Army project that developed the XV-15 tilt-rotor research \naircraft in 1970, after working for 10 years on propeller and rotor aerodynamic \ndesign and technology development at the Hamilton Standard Division of United \nTechnologies Corporation, Windsor Locks, Connecticut, and at the Boeing \nHelicopter Company, Riddley Park, Pennsylvania. Demo Giulianetti (B.S. in gen\xad\neral engineering, 1956, San Jose State University) joined NASA Ames’s Tilt Rotor \nResearch Aircraft Project Office in 1975, where he participated in the development \nof two XV-15 aircraft. After he began working at Ames in 1956, early on he took a']"," The purpose of flying the XV-15 behind and in close formation to the Lockheed YO-3A research aircraft was to obtain comparable free flight noise data to determine the effect of the wind tunnel walls on the measured sound during an acoustics test of the XV-15 metal-bladed proprotor in the acoustically treated test section of the Ames 80- by 120-foot wind tunnel. This was done by maintaining the YO-3A microphone location at a fixed distance and position with respect to the XV-15 proprotor, and by operating at the same prop-rotor operating condition. This allowed for a direct comparison between the flight data and wind tunnel test data."
"What are stick forces in helicopters and how do secondary effects such as airfoil imperfections, blade-bending distortions, and chordwise mass balance contribute to their generation?","Stick forces in helicopters can arise from various secondary effects, including airfoil imperfections, blade-bending distortions, and chordwise mass balance. These effects can cause pitching moments on the blades, which in turn produce oscillating and steady forces on the control stick. Oscillating forces can occur at frequencies of 1/rev. and even multiples of the number of blades, while steady forces come entirely from 1/rev. variations in blade-pitching moments.

In a study carried out by the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, the dynamic properties of helicopter rotor-blade systems were investigated. The study covered the derivation of the angles of attack of the inflow, of the blade-position variables—pitch, flapping, and lagging—and of the aerodynamic inertia forces acting on hinged blades in both hovering and transitional flight. The results showed that care should be exercised to insure the absence in the helicopter of regular disturbing forces, such as a hunting pitch and throttle governor or hunting automatic pilot, with frequencies near those of the resonant condition.

In another case, abrupt stick motions were found to cause forces perpendicular to the direction of motion which tended to whirl the stick in the direction of rotor rotation. This phenomenon can be a significant problem in large helicopters, as extreme care must be taken in blade construction to avoid small secondary effects that produce annoying control forces. Servo controls are necessary for very large helicopters to relieve the pilot from these feedback forces.

In conclusion, stick forces in helicopters are a significant problem that can arise from various secondary effects. Careful blade construction and the use of servo controls are necessary to mitigate these effects and ensure safe and stable flight.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n694\nof the blades as they rotate. In the helicopter, all stick forces must therefore arise \nfrom pitching moments on the blades themselves. When airfoil sections are chosen \nand mounted so as to have no pitching moments at any pitch angle, then there \nshould be no stick forces for the pilot to overcome.\nActually, pitching moments exist on rotor blades because of several second\xad\nary effects such as airfoil imperfections, blade-bending distortions, chordwise mass \nbalance, etc. Stick forces are caused from these secondary effects rather than from \nstraightforward moments as in the airplane.\nControl forces consist of both oscillating forces and steady forces. Oscillating \nforces may occur at frequencies of 1/rev. and even multiples of the number of \nblades. Oscillating forces with a frequency of 1/rev. are entirely chargeable to dif\xad\nferences in pitching moments between the rotor blades. For example, if only one \nblade of a three-bladed rotor experiences a pitching moment, this one blade exerts \na steady force on the swash plate as it rotates. This rotating force is transmitted to \nthe control stick. Because the pilot’s hand is not a rigid support, the control stick \nyields under the rotating force and describes a small circle. Helicopters are often \ncharacterized by a small 1/rev. stick shake.\nHigher frequency oscillations in the control stick can arise at integral multiples \nof the number of rotor blades. A three-bladed rotor may, therefore, experience a \n3/rev., 6/rev., 9/rev., etc., oscillation in the controls. These higher frequency oscil\xad\nlations arise from periodic changes in the pitching moment of each blade. The \nperiodic changes, in turn, arise from periodic air force changes in a rotor in forward \nflight or from periodic blade deflections. For example, a three-bladed rotor with \nequal pitching moments on all three blades will produce a 3/rev. motion of the \ncontrol stick in forward flight because of the change in velocity on the advancing \nand retreating blades. As the blade comes forward and experiences higher velocities, \nits pitching moment is increased, and since this happens three times for each rotor \nrevolution, a 3/rev. shake of the control stick results.\nOscillating forces in the control system can be prevented from annoying the \npilot by the use of irreversible controls or by making the effective mass of the pilot’s \nstick large enough to absorb the oscillating force. One convenient means of accom\xad\nplishing the latter is by the use of an inertia damper which may consist of a weight \non a high-pitch screw, the weight being forced to rotate when axial force is applied \nto the screw. The inertia damper is simply a means of producing a large, effective \nmass without heavy weights.\nSteady forces on the control stick come entirely from 1/rev. variations in blade-\npitching moments. These again may arise from periodic air forces, periodic blade \ndeflections, or both.\nSometimes tabs are used on blades intentionally to produce pitching moments. \nIn forward flight these pitching moments then vary periodically as the velocity over \nthe blade varies, becoming large on the advancing blade and small on the retreating \nblade. A steady stick force results.', '695\nDocument 5-45\nUsually stick forces are relatively small in small rotors (20 to 30 feet in diam\xad\neter). As diameters increase, however, stick forces increase rapidly. It is, therefore, \nvery difficult to use directly connected controls in large rotors since extreme care \nmust be taken in blade construction to avoid the small secondary effects which \nproduce the annoying control forces. Servo controls, which relieve the pilot from \nthese feedback forces, seem to be necessary for very large helicopters.\nVibration Characteristics. As in the case of control oscillations, the helicopter \nitself is subject to vibrating forces from the rotor. If it is assumed that the force \ninput from each rotor blade is identical, then the only frequencies at which oscilla\xad\ntions occur are again even multiples of the number of rotor blades. Vibrating forces \nmay be in a vertical, fore and aft, or sideward direction. The reduction of the input \nforces from the rotor blade is primarily a question of blade design, involving the \nproper distribution of masses and air forces along the span. The effect of the input \nforces on the vibration characteristics of the machine depends considerably upon \nthe natural frequencies of the fuselage structure. If the fuselage structure has any \nmode of vibration, such as vertical bending, fuselage torsion, etc., in resonance with \nan exciting frequency, vibrations may become quite disagreeable. One of the main \nproblems in minimizing vibrations in the helicopter lies in avoiding natural excit\xad\ning frequencies. This is difficult since exciting frequencies cover a wide range (3/\nrev., 6/rev., 9/rev., etc.).\nGround Resonance. The helicopter is a very complex dynamic system, involv\xad\ning masses and springs in several degrees of freedom. Sometimes couplings occur \nbetween blade lag motion in the rotating system and sideward or fore and aft \nmotion of the shaft. If insufficient damping is present in the system, a self-excited \nvibration may result, the ship shaking back and forth with increasing amplitude \nand the blades moving back and forth in the plane of rotation, out of pattern. This \nphenomenon is commonly known as ground resonance because the most frequent \nplace of occurrence of the vibration is on the ground where the machine is sup\xad\nported on its relatively soft tires, giving a low natural frequency of the machine in \nsideward motion. Ground resonance, if it begins, often results in complete destruc\xad\ntion of the machine within a few seconds. Several helicopters and autogyros have \nbeen destroyed by these self-excited vibrations.\nStability Characteristics. Hovering in the conventional helicopter requires \nconsiderable practice on the part of the pilot, although most of the problems tend to \ndisappear with experience. The novice pilot must learn to put up with high control \nsensitivity in roll, or, in other words, the high rate of roll per inch of stick displace\xad\nment. Helicopters with conventional control systems are subject to high control \nsensitivity which, according to reference VI-7 (Appendix IIA [not reproduced]), can \nlead to overcontrolling, and in turn, to a short-period, pilot-induced lateral oscilla\xad\ntion. High control sensitivity is apparently due to low rotor damping, which for the \nhelicopter is a fraction of that for airplanes. This problem is therefore minimized \nwith large diameter rotors, which have greater damping than small rotors.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n666\nratio and becomes more pronounced at higher speeds. The second source is the \nunstable fuselage.\nIt may be well to point out here that airplanes can and do exhibit instability \nwith angle of attack at times, but this condition is recognized as unsatisfactory and \nis generally prevented by keeping the center of gravity sufficiently well forward.\nThe effects of the instability with respect to angle of attack on the flight char\xad\nacteristics of the helicopter were subsequently investigated in more detail, first in \nthe low-speed flight range and then at successively higher speeds. It was found that \nin maneuvers in which the stick was abruptly deflected from trim and held, the \nnormal acceleration built up at an increasing rate for a length of time detectable \nto the pilot. Furthermore, the acceleration and pitching velocity, at least for small \nstick deflections when the maneuver could be continued for a reasonable time, \ndid not reach a maximum until 3 or 4 seconds had elapsed. The acceleration and \npitching velocity in this type of maneuver apparently would continue to increase for \neven greater periods of time were it not for the stabilizing influence of the associ\xad\nated speed change. The stick forces accompanying these maneuvers are undesirable. \nAfter transient effects have disappeared they become somewhat unstable; that is, \na push in pull-ups or a pull in push changes the magnitude of the forces depend\xad\ning upon blade characteristics. Of course it is highly desirable that these forces \nbe\xa0stable.\nLongitudinal Oscillations: Stick-fixed longitudinal oscillations of the HNS-1 \nwere studied to shed more light on the interaction of the stability with speed and \nstability with angle of attack. Studies have been prepared of two recorded time \nstudies of attempted stick-fixed oscillations. For these cases the helicopter had a set \nof experimental blades of low solidity, not production blades. Low solidity neces\xad\nsitates higher pitch of the same rpm and thus stalling was encountered [for] fewer \nforward speeds than for the production blades.\nThe first slide (Figure 1 [not reproduced]) shows an oscillation initiated from \nsteady level flight at 40 miles per hour by a momentary aft motion of the stick. \nThe type of motion shown resembles the airplane phugoid motion in that changes \nin airspeed and altitude occur, but there is the important difference that definite \nchanges in angle of attack take place. The period of the motion is about 14 seconds, \nwhich is long in that the pilot does not have trouble controlling the oscillations. \nThe motion doubles in amplitude in one cycle. During the third cycle it reaches \n25° up from the trim attitude and shows successive increments in acceleration, from \nabout +.4g and −.3g. This maneuver was terminated when the attitude and the rate \nof change of attitude, acceleration, and speed were such as would cause the pilot \napprehension.\nThe next slide (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) shows an oscillation attempted from \nsteady level flight at 65 miles per hour. Again the helicopter was disturbed by an \nintentional [stic]k motion, after which the stick was held fixed. The helicopter \nnosed up mildly and then nosed down. The helicopter was still nosing down at an', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n668\ncharacteristics which could readily be made to function satisfactorily at low speeds \nwill offer greater difficulty or may even become inadequate at these higher speeds.\nIt will be noted that a peak is shown at about 30 miles per hour. In this range \nif the controls are fixed the helicopter will soon nose up, slow down, and slide back\xad\nwards with resulting yawing motions and control difficulties.\nObservations Particularly Concerning Hovering: Thus far only the forward \nflight characteristics have been discussed. Hovering, of course, precedes and fol\xad\nlows all forward flight and is the outstanding reason for the existence of helicopter \ntypes. We feel, however, that at present the problems associated with hovering in \nthis particular type are more indefinite than in forward flight, that they tend to \ndisappear with a little flight practice, and that they don’t affect its general utility to \nthe extent that limitations on night and instrument flying do.\nOne of the problems which the trainee must overcome in a helicopter of this \ntype and size is the high control sensitivity in roll or the high rate of roll per unit \nstick displacement. This sensitivity can lead to over controlling which results in a \nshort-period, pilot-induced lateral oscillation. It is caused, apparently, by the pilot’s \nlag in removing control following response of the machine. The result can be lik\xad\nened to what occurs with an auto-pilot having improper follow-up. It might be well \nto point out here that with constant ratio of control stick displacement to cyclic \nfeathering the rolling velocity obtained will vary inversely as the diameter, or, the \nsmaller machine will roll the faster. Thus sensitivity becomes less of a problem with \nlarger machines.\nThe forces the pilot encounters in deflecting the stick can accentuate or mini\xad\nmize his impression of the sensitivity. The pilot should first be able to trim steady \nforces to zero. He should also have a force gradient opposing displacement of the \nstick in order that he can properly judge the control being applied. The control force \ngradient centers the stick when it is released, reducing the lag in the follow-up process \nand reducing the required pilot effort. With one set of blades on the R-4 the lateral \ngradient was satisfactory, but with other blades peculiar characteristics appeared. In \nsome cases the initial force change with deflection was proper but the force returned \nto zero or even reversed as rolling velocity developed. From the pilot’s standpoint \nthis is very undesirable. The following slide (Figure 4 [not reproduced]) illustrates \nthe character of the lateral forces immediately following stick displacement for two \ndifferent rotors. Rotor A illustrates the type of transient force variation considered \nunsatisfactory, while the force variation for rotor B was considered acceptable.\nIt is interesting to note at this time that the longitudinal forces immediately \nfollowing abrupt stick displacement differed in character from the lateral forces. \nThese are shown on the next slide (Figure 5 [not reproduced]). In this case neither \nrotor A nor rotor B showed acceptable characteristics, although the pilot reported \nthe characteristics of rotor A noticeably inferior to those of rotor B.\nIn another case abrupt stick motions were found to cause forces perpendicular \nto the direction of motion which tended to whirl the stick in the direction of rotor', '637\nDocument 5-43 (a–m)\nnatural frequencies of the drag-angle motion and the damping required to prevent \nexcessive drag-angle oscillation response. Both symmetrical oscillations, in which \n[some] of the blades lag and advance together, and unsymmetrical oscillations, in \nwhich the blades are out of phase with each other, were studied. The results, which \nare reported in Technical Note 1888, showed that, whereas the frequency of the \nsymmetrical drag-hinge oscillations was influenced by the engine and gearbox iner\xad\ntias and rotor-shaft torsional stiffness, the frequency of the unsymmetrical oscilla\xad\ntions was affected primarily by the rotor-pylon bending stiffness. These results were \nshown to be in agreement with predicted values and indicated that care should be \nexercised to insure the absence in the helicopter of regular disturbing forces, such as \na hunting pitch and throttle governor or hunting automatic pilot, with frequencies \nnear those of the resonant condition.\nA contract investigation was carried out by the Polytechnic Institute of \nBrooklyn in which a theoretical study was made of the dynamic properties of heli\xad\ncopter rotor-blade systems. The study dealt with the application of the theory of \nsmall oscillations about a steady state of motion to a representative blade system \nhinged to a driving hub. The study covered the derivation of the angles of attack of \nthe inflow, of the blade-position variables—pitch, flapping, and lagging—and of \nthe aerodynamic inertia forces acting on hinged blades in both hovering and trans\xad\nlational flight. Also included were the development and solution of the equilibrium \nconditions of the blade system and the development of the frequency, stability, and \ndamping properties of hinged blades in both hovering and translational flight. Four \ncombinations of relative constraint conditions between angles of pitch, flapping, \nand lagging were investigated. The results are reported in Technical Note\xa01430.']","

Stick forces in helicopters are the forces that the pilot feels on the control stick, which is used to control the pitch of the rotor blades and, therefore, the helicopter's altitude and direction. These forces arise from pitching moments on the blades themselves, which are caused by secondary effects such as airfoil imperfections, blade-bending distortions, chordwise mass balance, and other factors. When airfoil sections are chosen and mounted so as to have no pitching moments at any pitch angle, there should be no stick forces for the pilot to overcome. However, in reality, these secondary effects do exist and cause stick forces.

Oscillating forces in the control stick can occur at frequencies of 1/rev. and multiples of the number of blades. These forces are caused by differences in pitching moments between the rotor blades. For example, if only one blade of a three-bladed rotor experiences a pitching moment, this one blade exerts a steady force on the swash plate as it rotates, which is transmitted to the control stick. The pilot's hand is not a rigid support, so the control stick yields under the rotating force and describes a small circle, causing a small 1/rev. stick shake.

Higher frequency oscillations in the control stick can arise at integral multiples of the number of rotor blades. These oscillations arise from periodic changes in the pitching moment of each blade, which are caused by periodic air force changes in a rotor in forward flight or from periodic blade deflections. For example, a three-bladed rotor with equal pitching moments on all three blades will produce a 3/rev. motion of the control stick in forward flight because of the change in velocity on the advancing and retreating blades.

Oscillating forces in the control system can be prevented from annoying the pilot by the use of irreversible controls or by making the effective mass of the pilot's stick large enough to absorb the oscillating force. One convenient means of accomplishing the latter is by the use of an inertia damper, which may consist of a weight on a high-pitch screw, the weight being forced to rotate when axial force is applied to the screw. The inertia damper is simply a means of producing a large, effective mass without heavy weights.

Steady forces on the control stick come entirely from 1/rev. variations in blade-pitching moments, which may arise from periodic air forces, periodic blade deflections, or both. Sometimes tabs are used on blades intentionally to produce pitching moments, which vary periodically as the velocity over the blade varies, becoming large on the advancing blade and small on the retreating blade. A steady stick force results."
"What were the primary scientific goals of the Cassini-Huygens mission, and what were the key scientific instruments carried by the Cassini orbiter and the Huygens probe, including the power source and gravity assists used during its journey to Saturn and its moon Titan?","The primary scientific goals of the Cassini-Huygens mission were to study the Saturn system, including its rings, its atmosphere, its magnetic environment, and its moons, with a particular focus on Titan, the largest and most interesting moon in the Saturn system. The Cassini orbiter carried 12 scientific instruments, while the Huygens probe carried six scientific instruments. The Cassini orbiter was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), while the Huygens probe was powered by a lithium-ion battery. The Cassini-Huygens mission used gravity assists from Venus and Earth to reach Saturn, and the Cassini orbiter used a series of orbits around Saturn to study the planet and its moons. The Huygens probe was released from the Cassini orbiter and parachuted through the atmosphere of Titan to land on its surface. The Cassini-Huygens mission provided unprecedented insights into the Saturn system and its moons, including the discovery of liquid methane lakes on Titan and the detection of organic compounds in its atmosphere.","['50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n238\nwhole Cassini program, including the Huygens probe and the antenna \nunder development in Italy, should undergo an independent review by a \nteam of external experts. In Europe, this demand was viewed as an unac\xad\nceptable violation of the cooperative spirit. After some tense meetings, ESA \neventually accepted the review, which turned out to be a positive experience \nbecause ESA’s contribution survived it and because it created confidence and \nstrengthened cooperative spirit.\nCONCLUSION\nFollowing the 1994 political crisis and the 1995 review, the Cassini program \nwent on smoothly. The Huygens probe was integrated and tested at Dornier’s \nfacilities in Ottobrunn near Munich, and in April 1997 it was shipped to \nNASA’s Kennedy Space Center to be fitted to the main spacecraft. The \nCassini-Huygens mission was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral \non 15 October 1997. About 500 representatives of the scientific, engineering, \nand industrial teams in Europe that had created the Huygens probe attended \nthe launch. After a seven-year cruise, Cassini entered orbit around Saturn on \n1 July 2004. Six months later, on 25 December, Huygens was released by the \nmother spacecraft and started its 20-day, 4-million-kilometer cruise toward \nTitan. According to the mission scenario, a sequence of parachutes would \ndeploy to slow it down, and its scientific instruments would be exposed to \nTitan’s atmosphere during descent. If the probe survived impact with the \nsurface, its instruments would be expected to continue to operate, providing \nadditional information for a time ranging from a few minutes to half an hour \nor more. Out in space, Cassini would pick up Huygens’s signals, then turn its \nantenna toward Earth, and relay the recorded scientific data. \nOn Friday, 14 January 2005, a group of nervous and excited scientists \ngathered in the control room of the European Space Operations Centre \n(ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, to observe this epochal event in the his\xad\ntory of solar system exploration and enjoy the crowning achievement of their \ncareers. For the first time since the beginning of the Space Age, a human \nartifact would be landed on another world in the outer solar system. The \nscientists and their distinguished guests, including ministers, space agency \nofficials, and journalists, were waiting. Around noon, the news arrived that \na faint radio signal from the probe had been picked up by the Green Bank \nradio telescope in West Virginia. Huygens had then survived the entry phase \nand was active! Late in the afternoon, the first scientific data, relayed by the \nCassini spacecraft, arrived at ESOC. Scientists hurried to analyze the data, \nand soon the press got the first stunning images of Titan’s surface.

It consists of a sophisticated spacecraft performing multiple orbital \ntours around Saturn, as well as a probe that was released from the main \nspacecraft to parachute through the atmosphere to the surface of Saturn’s \nlargest and most interesting moon, Titan. The mission’s name honors two \n17th-century astronomers who pioneered modern observations of Saturn \nand its satellites. The orbiter is named after Jean-Dominique Cassini (1625–\n1712), who discovered the satellites Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys, and Dione, as well \nas ring features such as the so-called “Cassini division.” The Titan probe is \nnamed after Christiaan Huygens (1629–95), who discovered Saturn’s largest \nsatellite in 1655. \n1.\t\nThe scientific background and technical aspects of the mission are discussed in D.\xa0M. \nHarland, Cassini at Saturn (Berlin, Germany: Springer, 2007).

Huygens thus entered the ESA scientific program as \nEurope’s first planetary mission and the first mission in the Horizon 2000 \nlong-term program.\nUPS AND DOWNS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\nWhile these developments occurred in Europe, Cassini’s scientific constitu\xad\nency in the United States was working hard to have the mission approved by \nNASA and endorsed by Congress. In October 1989, Congress approved the \nMariner Mark II program, including both Cassini and the cometary mission \nCRAF. NASA and ESA then issued parallel announcements of opportunity \nfor instruments to fly on the Saturn orbiter and the Titan probe, respectively. \nFollowing peer review on both sides of the Atlantic, the two space agencies \napproved the recommended scientific payloads and interdisciplinary inves\xad\ntigations. At the same time, an institutional arrangement was defined for \nthe implementation of the scientific aspects of the mission. On 17 December \n1990, a memorandum of understanding was signed by NASA and ESA, and \nthe Cassini-Huygens mission was thus well on its way toward its scheduled \nlaunch in November 1995.16\nThe way, however, proved to be fraught with difficulties arising less from \ntechnical problems than from political uncertainty in the United States. In \nOctober 1991, Congress denied the 13 percent increase for the NASA budget \nrequested by the White House, approving only a 3 percent increase, hardly \nenough to compensate for inflation. In this framework, the 1992 budget for \nthe CRAF/Cassini program was set at $211 million, dramatically less than the \nrequested $328 million. As a consequence, NASA decided to delay the launch \nof the Saturn mission until October 1997. This decision was not accepted \nin Europe. A two-year delay would cost ESA an additional $30 million, the \nESA Director General wrote to the NASA Administrator.

What is the ICE Cubes service and how does it enable microgravity research on the International Space Station (ISS)?,"The ICE Cubes service, a commercial partnership between Space Applications Services (SA) and the European Space Agency (ESA), enables microgravity research on the International Space Station (ISS) through the Materials Science Laboratory. One example of this is the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Materials Science research, which is addressing ecological and economic challenges as part of a world-class program involving hundreds of international partners from academia and industry. The main goal of this research is to increase understanding of material solidification processes in order to develop new, stronger, lightweight materials that will have a significant impact on industry. Another important goal of the research is to help resolve some of the most pressing issues facing the planet, such as improving fuel efficiency and improving the consumption and recycling of materials. One of the many materials projects supported by ESA on the ISS is Columnar-to-Equiaxed Transition in Solidification Processing (CETSOL), which has been studying the microstructure of aluminum alloy samples formed during solidification, specifically focusing on how columnar dendritic or tree-like structures in a solidifying melt evolve into randomly oriented “branches,” the ‘equiaxed’ structure, and the parameters that influence this transition. The determination of the internal (micro)structure is crucial for understanding the properties of the final material.

In addition to materials research, the ISS provides a unique laboratory environment for studying fluid dynamics and space and observations of Earth. Results from space station fluids investigations have allowed investigators to compile a video database of capillary and fluid flows in microgravity, which has contributed to the use of better computer models for designing microgravity fluid systems such as fluid transfer systems on future spacecraft. The space station also provides the required power and data exchange for the powerful instruments that study our universe. Results from all-sky x-ray imaging from the space station have yielded the discovery of eight new black-hole candidates and contribute to observation of transient events in space such as binary X-ray pulsars, stellar flare, active galactic nucleus, tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole, and hypernova remnant.

During the \nlast six crew rotations (as of May 2018), 416 R&D \ninvestigations were supported. Although the amount \nof crew hours available has increased, the most \nsignificant factor driving this increase is the  \nproliferation of commercial research facilities  \naboard the space station. \nNanoRacks LLC was one of the first commercial \npartners to operate research facilities onboard the ISS. \nBeginning with the installation of the first NanoRacks \nInternal Science Platform in 2010, they applied the \nstandardized CubeSat dimensional form factor  \n(10 x 10 x 10 centimeters [~4 x 4 x 4 inches]) to provide \n“plug-and-play” research capabilities aboard the \nISS. As of 2018, Nanoracks operates three of these \nplatforms designed for use within the pressurized \nspace station environment. Each is approximately  \n43 x 23 x 51 centimeters (17 x 9 x 20 inches), weighs \napproximately 5.5 kilograms (12 pounds), and provides \nroom for up to 16 payloads in the CubeSat form factor. \nNanoRacks offers complete in-house capabilities for \npayload integration, payload design and development, \nand interfacing with NASA and the ISS international \npartners. The core payload hardware supported by \nthese platforms are called NanoLabs. Every NanoLab \nhas a circuit board that activates the experiment \nhoused within, turns it off, and can be functioned \nfor other activities. NanoLabs are plugged into the \nresearch platforms via a normal Universal Serial Bus \n(USB) port, thus allowing data and power to flow and \ncan even be developed by third-party vendors. A single \nNanoLab is 1U (i.e., one unit) in size, but the platforms \ncan also support 2U, or 4U or 2 by 4U sizes, with cost \nvarying by the size of the NanoLab. This plug-and-\nplay system uses a simple, standardized interface \nthat reduces payload integration cost and schedule \nfor nanoscale research in microgravity. \nThrough the standardization of test \nhardware and implementation of \nthe CubeLab approach, the cost of \nconducting research in orbit has been \nreduced as much as threefold...   \nAs of 2018, NanoRacks has supported more than \n300 investigations on the ISS and operates multiple \nfacilities both internally and externally on the space \nstation.

"Question: What is the significance of the ""single string"" design in the development of single-stage-to-orbit vehicles (SSTO)?","The ""single string"" design in the development of single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles is significant because it is a design philosophy that maximizes the lessons learned from the Space Shuttle program and applies the minimum technology required to allow for an operationally efficient vehicle. This design philosophy was selected by the NASA Access to Space study team for the reference SSTO vehicle, which called for a tri-propellant propulsion system, graphite-composite structure, aluminum-lithium propellant tanks, and an advanced thermal protection system (TPS) and subsystems. The team also noted that added margin could be attained by using graphite-composite fuel tanks instead of aluminum-lithium tanks.

Koelle of Deutsche Aerospace provided the following \nbackground summary: \nThe key problem in the past was performance, resulting in four-\nstage or three-stage launch vehicles. The introduction of liquid \nhydrogen/liquid oxygen for upper stages reduced the number of \nstages required for LEO [low-Earth orbit] to two, and today we \nare working towards single-stage vehicles. \nThere is still much discussion of whether SSTOs are feasible. \nThis concept doubtless represents the ultimate solution, however, \nbeyond feasibility it must be economically competitive also.\nThe optimum system solution also depends on the transporta\xad\ntion task. In the same way we find different types of vehicles on \nground like cars, busses and trucks, there are different optimal \nconcepts for space transportation…. In parallel we see the advent \nof winged launch systems (as suggested by the late Prof. [Eugen] \nSänger already in 1932). The air-launched Pegasus on the one \nhand, as well as re-entry gliders like the Shuttle Orbiter or the \nEuropean Hermes Project on the other hand can be considered as \nforerunners of future two-stage and finally eventually single-stage \nwinged vehicles.67 \nIn the United Kingdom, Reaction Engines Limited has been working \non development plans for the Skylon reusable launch vehicle. According to \nthe company, the Skylon is “an unpiloted, reusable spaceplane intended to \nprovide reliable, responsive and cost-effective access to space.”68 In regard to \nChina’s developmental effort, while few details are available, popular litera\xad\nture suggests that China is developing an experimental vehicle resembling \nthe X-34. Reputedly named Shenlong (“Divine Dragon”), it is intended \nfor air-launch from a modified Xian H-6 bomber (the Chinese-produced \nderivation of the Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-16 Badger), in the same fashion that \nthe United States’ North American X-15 was air-launched from a Boeing \nNB-52 Stratofortress. \nIn early 2001, Teal Group analyst Marco Antonio Cáceres commented on \nthe reusable launch vehicle programs then underway worldwide by noting that \n[t]here are roughly a dozen reusable launch vehicle (RLV) devel\xad\nopment efforts worldwide, including a few Russian and European \nprograms for which there [is] little information. Most of these \nprograms are not much farther along than the concept design', 'The “First” X-34: A Prequel\n69\nand operational costs—progress toward the timely fielding of a commercially \nviable space launch system, which significantly reduces the price of launch in \nits payload class.”17 \nThe Phase III decision was dependent “on business and operations plans, \nspecific technical metrics, and programmatic criteria. Included in the technical \ncriteria [were] the demonstration, through the X-33 project (focused on rocket \nbased single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) feasibility), that low-cost access to space \nis technically feasible and that operational costs for such a vehicle are accept\xad\nable.” The two programmatic requirements were “1) the X-33 and X-34 pro\xad\ngrams have demonstrated that cooperative Government/industry technology \ndevelopment programs can be both successful and efficient, and 2) acceptable \nbusiness arrangements have been reached which will facilitate the development \nand operation of the next generation of space-launch systems.”18\nThe NASA Advisory Council (NAC) reviewed the above agreement and, \nwhile generally supportive of the Reusable Launch Vehicle program, raised six \nissues, two of which are reviewed here, along with the responses from Gary \nE. Payton.19\nIssue raised: We [NAC] remain concerned that a completely reus\xad\nable SSTO system may not be the best choice and that NASA is not \nconsidering alternatives to SSTO in sufficient depth and breadth \nto provide a rational basis for selecting a[n] SSTO launch system \neven if the X-33 program indicates that it is technically feasible.\nResponse: This Presidentially approved policy [Presidential Decision \nDirective NSTC-4] dictates that we pursue a technology devel\xad\nopment and flight demonstration program oriented to an end-\nof-decade decision concerning the feasibility of rocket powered \nSSTO technology. This development path was deemed to be the \nmost stressing, technologically, but holds the greatest promise for \nreductions in the cost of space launch. Furthermore, this approach \ndoes not preempt a decision to use a TSTO [two-stage-to-orbit] \narchitecture should SSTO technology be too difficult or too costly \nto achieve. A decision to pursue a more limited TSTO would delay \nthe potential benefits of SSTO systems for decades. Our ability to \ndeliver a TSTO system is not in question, even with today’s tech\xad\nnology, and resources to develop technology in support of TSTO, \nseparate from SSTO, would be a wasted effort.20 \nIssue raised: …NASA should develop a Government user payload \nmodel that could be expressed in terms of ranges for flights per', 'Designing and Building the X-34\n131\none could successfully undertake design development of a low-cost, quick-\nturnaround boost system.

The ""single string"" design refers to a design approach where a vehicle has only one of each critical system, such as engines or avionics. In the context of single-stage-to-orbit vehicles (SSTO), this design approach has been a significant challenge due to the high reliability required for the vehicle to reach orbit. The failure of any single system could result in the mission being lost, making the development of SSTO vehicles with this design approach a complex and risky endeavor. Despite these challenges, the ""single string"" design has been pursued in various SSTO concepts, such as the X-33 Program, due to its potential benefits in terms of simplicity, weight reduction, and cost savings."

Question: How does the designer ensure that the seaplane does not fall back into the water during take-off?,"During take-off, the seaplane may or may not be stalled off the water, depending on the design. The designer plans on a velocity higher than the minimum in the take-off, because the maximum lift coefficient is at a high angle of attack. As the seaplane accelerates during the take-off run, the wing is at an angle of attack corresponding to a low float resistance and a low seaplane drag. Although the angle between the wing and the float can be altered by the designer, the angle is a compromise as finally established. Near the end of the take-off, the wing can be pulled up so as to stall off the water at minimum speed, but the afterbody of the float must not touch the water in doing so, and care must be exercised that the seaplane does not fall back into the water owing to the low flying speed. In a sea, it may be necessary to stall off the top of a wave.

To refine the answer, let's consider the factors affecting the take-off performance of a seaplane. The calculation of the take-off problem of a seaplane is similar to that of a landplane. The take-off time and distance depend upon the acceleration of the craft from rest up to the minimum flying speed. The force tending to produce acceleration is the thrust of the propeller. The forces opposing acceleration are those due to air and water resistance. The difference between these forces at any instant is the actual accelerating force.

The minimum speed of flight of the seaplane is fixed by the formula:

minimum velocity = square root of W over L of C max times S

W
LCmax · S

where W is the weight of the seaplane, L is the wing span, C max is the maximum lift coefficient, and S is the wing area.

To ensure that the seaplane does not fall back into the water during take-off, the designer must consider the water resistance and the surface controls. The water resistance is a maximum at a speed of approximately 274 times the square root of the weight over the waterline length of the float. Up to this speed, the surface controls are not fully effective. This means that the float is practically free of trim.

Owing to the nature of the bottom of the forebody of the float, the relative motion between the flo","['275\nDocument 5-20 (a–c)\nAll of the parts determining this velocity are selected for aerodynamic consider\xad\nations. The airfoil section is established with due regard to the usual factors. This \nfixes the lift coefficient at all angles of attack. The limit on the landing speed and \nthe maximum speed compromise in fixing the wing loading. Consequently, the \nstalling speed is more or less a quantity that is not influenced by the take-off con\xad\nsiderations. It should be noted, however, that the designer has it within his power \nto change the wing in order to change the take-off, if he so requires and, also, that \nslots, flaps, and similar devices are equally effective in affecting the seaplane perfor\xad\nmance as they are in altering the performance of a landplane in this respect.\nIn practice, a seaplane may or may not be stalled off the water in take-off. The \ndesigner plans on a velocity higher than the minimum in the take-off, because the \nmaximum lift coefficient is at a high angle of attack. As the seaplane accelerates \nduring the take-off run, the wing is at an angle of attack corresponding to a low \nfloat resistance and a low seaplane drag. Although the angle between the wing and \nthe float can be altered by the designer, the angle is a compromise as finally estab\xad\nlished. Near the end of the take-off, the wing can be pulled up so as to stall off the \nwater at minimum speed, but the afterbody of the float must not touch the water \nin doing so, and care must be exercised that the seaplane does not fall back into the \nwater owing to the low flying speed. In a sea, it may be necessary to stall off the top \nof a wave. Otherwise, it is customary to consider the minimum speed at take-off \nat an angle of attack lower than that of maximum lift coefficient. Some reserve lift \nthen exists after the float has left the water.\nThe rate of acceleration of the craft during the take-off run depends on the \namount that the propeller thrust exceeds the combined water and air resistance and \non the mass accelerated. The propeller characteristics are established from factors \nother than take-off, excepting when take-off is critical. For fixed-blade propellers, \ngood climb and high speed are likely to be more important than the take-off. But \nin case the hump resistance of the float is so great that excess thrust is not avail\xad\nable with a certain propeller set to a definite pitch, a change in propeller design, \na change in propeller efficiency, or a change in pitch setting may give the desired \nresults. The propeller diameter is limited by the position of the power plant with \nrespect to the other parts of the airplane and with respect to the water. The pitch \nsetting of the propeller blades can be adjusted to give some change in static thrust \nwithout affecting the other characteristic too much, and this means is resorted to \nusually in case of difficulties. A large pitch gives a large static thrust. Controllable \npitch propellers with pitch settings varying 8 to 10° permit the variations between \nthe static thrust and the cruising-speed thrust desired.\nThe propeller design, diameter, and pitch setting having been determined, it \nis necessary that the propeller thrust be calculated for the speeds concerned in the \ntake-off. It is assumed that the static thrust exists up to 20 or 30 miles per hour, \nand in this range it is constant. Diehl gives the following empirical equation for \nstatic thrust:', '273\nDocument 5-20 (a–c)\nDocument 5-20 (b), William Nelson, “Take-Off of the Seaplane,” \nchapter 9 in Seaplane Design (New York and London: McGraw-\nHill Book Company, Inc., 1934), pp. 102–121.\n40. GENERAL\nThe seaplane during its take-off from the water is a water craft and an aircraft \ncombined. Afloat, it must retain the water characteristics of stability and buoy\xad\nancy. In the take-off, it combines these with certain air characteristics and also \nintroduces two other features—water resistance and trimming moment of the float \nsystem. These latter items are not particularly difficult to handle if the seaplane is \nfitted with sufficient power and if control over the trimming moment can be exer\xad\ncised by the air controls. But if a balance between the power required to overcome \nthe water resistance and that required to attain maximum speed in the air is sought, \nthe take-off problem requires careful analysis in the design stage. This condition \nmay be brought about by the maximum load that the seaplane is to carry or by a \nlimit on the take-off distance with a fixed load.\nSeaplanes ordinarily take off into the wind. When conditions of sea warrant \nit and when the wind is light, they may be taken off in the trough of the sea. It is \ndesirable and sometimes necessary that the take-off be as short as practicable to \nreduce the dangers incident to rough water. And even where smooth waters are \navailable, limitations may be imposed by land, shallow depth of water, or other \nrestrictions. It is the designer’s responsibility to provide a seaplane with a float hav\xad\ning air-worthy and seaworthy characteristics and permitting the seaplane to take off \nwith the specified load in the shortest distance possible.\nThe take-off, aside from float characteristics, depends on the arrangement of \nthat float relative to the rest of the seaplane. It depends on the wing and the wing \narea. It depends on the power available and also upon the control that can be \nexerted over the forces extant. Aerodynamic considerations and performance of \nthe seaplane in the air govern most seaplane features other than the float and its \nposition. A good float has a low water resistance and is so situated that control over \nits trim can be handled by the ailerons, wings, and elevators. It must not take off \nbefore the seaplane has reached stalling speed, and it must not “porpoise” or stick \nto the water.\nThe limits to the take-off performance are fixed by the wing loading and the \npower loading of the seaplane as a whole.\nStarting at rest, when the power is applied the seaplane is accelerated by the \npropeller thrust. As this thrust overcomes the water resistance, the seaplane gains \nvelocity. Air resistance of the seaplane comes into play. Then, during the remainder \nof the take-off, the thrust of the propeller in excess of the air resistance and the \nwater resistance tends to accelerate the seaplane until it takes off the water. Several \npoints are of special interest in this take-off. When the speed has reached about 40', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n406\ndrag and the thrust as wide as possible, for the magnitude of the difference between \nthese two forces determines the performance efficiency of the plane. If one could \nthink only of the resistance problem and design a hull with no other requirement \nin mind, the task would be simple.\nBut a body shaped solely for water flotation and navigation would stir up such \nair turbulence in flight that a high percentage of the thrust would be expended in \novercoming its drag. Such a seaplane, if it flew at all, would have relatively small \ncargo capacity, would be necessarily of slow speed, and, because of the high fuel \nconsumption, would have a short flight range. On the other hand[,] if the body \nwere designed with no other thought than to reduce the drag, it would be incapable \nof taking off from the water. The streamlined shape that is best for the air has a ten\xad\ndency to submerge when it is propelled on the water. A large part of the effort of the \nhydrodynamic staff at Langley has been expended upon the twin problems: trying \nto effect a seaplane body that will combine low water resistance with low air drag.\nWhen these studies began, the most frequent question in planning a new \ndesign was whether or not the seaplane would take off. Two factors were the take-\noff speed and the maximum gross weight that the plane would lift at that speed. It \nhad been customary to infer theoretical improvements from previously successful \nresults, but application of such inferences had yielded some disappointing surprises: \nnew designs that would not take off at the speeds planned or that would not lift the \ndesired loads at any attainable take-off speed. The tank rendered all this guesswork \nunnecessary. By making a small-scale model of the proposed hull, and towing it \nthrough the tank at the planned speed and with the desired load, it was possible to \nsettle the question in advance of costly construction.\nOne of the first jobs was to determine how the water resistance varied with \nincreasing speed. It was found that the magnitude of the resistance at each speed \nwas affected by the trim, or fore-and-aft angle, that the craft assumed; and the \ntrim depended in part on the control power of the horizontal tail. So the initial \ninvestigations led to studies of trim and tail forces also. Finally, from the data accu\xad\nmulated it became possible for a designer to make quite accurate predictions of \nthe amount of thrust required to push the craft along on the water and also to \ndetermine in advance what measure of longitudinal control was required of the tail. \nThis extensive series of researches placed the whole subject of water resistance on a \nfirmer basis, and established fundamental data that could be applied in the design \nof a seaplane of any specified gross-load capacity or take-off speed.\nPerformance at take-off is affected by the power loading of the seaplane and \nalso by its wing loading. By power loading is meant the gross weight divided by the \nengine horsepower, and towing-tank experiments showed that when power loadings \nwere held below about fifteen pounds per horsepower the effect of water resistance \nbecame a relatively unimportant criterion in hull design. As the power loading rises \nabove fifteen pounds per horsepower, it engenders higher water resistance, limits \nthe payload that can be carried, prolongs the take-off run, and accentuates most', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n282\ngives a high resistance. At the finish of the take-off, all of the water forces acting are \nconcentrated in and near the step, so that trimming moments become reduced and \nfinally disappear altogether. The resistance of the float at the final stages of take-off \nacts considerably below the c.g. and tends to pull the nose of the float down.\nThe designer must consider all of the factors involved in order to approach a \ncondition of moment equilibrium without being dependent upon the surface con\xad\ntrols. The value and the location of the propeller thrust, the value of lift and the \nc.p. of the wings and of the horizontal tail surfaces, the weight of the seaplane and \nthe location of the c.g., the location of the c.b. of the float, the drag of the seaplane, \nthe water resistance of the float, the location of the step, and the trimming moment \nhave a bearing on the moment equilibrium desired. Surface controls can be brought \ninto action to overcome the variations encountered, and they should be limited to a \nfew degrees; but since they are essential to capitulate with wind and sea conditions, \ndependence thereon should be minimized.\nThe location of the c.g. relative to the step of the float (usually just forward of \nthe step) and the angle of the float relative to the wing are the factors most read\xad\nily available to the designer to give variations to the moment diagram that may be \ndesirable. Changing the step location on the float may serve. Changing the vertical \ndistance between the c.g. and the thrust line is effective. Changes in the power \nand in the wing can be resorted to, but as a rule these features are fixed for other \nreasons, and it is not considered advisable to utilize changes therein for float perfor\xad\nmance unless it becomes absolutely necessary. There are a large number of second\xad\nary matters that ought to be taken into consideration for an accurate solution of \nthe problems involved; for the purposes herein concerned, they are not necessary.\nThe procedure that appears rational, as given by Schroder in a reference, is to \nselect an arrangement that ought to satisfy the requirements of a good take-off and \nestablish that as the original. Model tests and take-off calculations are made for \nthat original condition. Calculation of the effect of changes therein can then be \nmade until the best arrangement is established. This requires an investigation of the \nvarious forces and the moments of those forces during the take-off.\nThe resistance and trimming moments of the float model are obtained from \nthe basin tests. The moments due to wings and tail surfaces come from tunnel \ntests or by calculations. The propeller thrust at various speeds can be calculated. \nThese moments and forces are reduced to comparative moments to suit the model \nsize. The moments are plotted for various speeds. Comparisons can then be made \ndirectly with those produced by the float. Where these moments are the same at \na given speed, equilibrium exists. These two sets of moment curves will also show \nthe angle of trim of the float if left free to trim, and in turn the resistance in the \nfree-to-trim condition can be recorded.\nAerodynamic computations can be made of the moments which can be pro\xad\nduced by the elevators at the various settings. The difference between this elevator \nmoment and that due to the combined effect of wing, tail surfaces, and propeller', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n274\nper cent of the take-off speed, the water resistance is a maximum. Also, up to this \nspeed the surface controls are not fully effective. This means that the float is practi\xad\ncally free of trim.\nOwing to the nature of the bottom of the forebody of the float, the relative \nmotion between the floats and the water tends to lift the bow of the former. This \nproduces a tail-heavy moment on the float. At some point, the longitudinal righting \nmoment and the thrust balance this tail-heavy moment so that the float assumes a \nmaximum trim angle just before the seaplane is put on the step. Some floats may \nhave a bottom shape so that the bow is held down instead of being lifted. Naturally, \nsuch a condition is not desirable, for it is difficult to overcome this suction with the \nair controls at low speeds.\nOwing to some cause that has not yet been analyzed satisfactorily, some floats \nporpoise in the take-off run. It has been suggested that this may be due to the heav\xad\ning and pitching action of the float, causing it to bury its bow and then to repeat \nthis movement with the tail so as to make take-off impossible. Whether or not it \ncan be identified by causation, it is known that longitudinal movement of the float \nrelative to the c.g. of the seaplane tends to reduce porpoising. This is not a solution \nto the problem, for it may be undesirable to relocate a float for other reasons. In any \ncase, porpoising of a hull or a float cannot be permitted as an attribute of result by \nthe designer.\nAt the hump speed, the air resistance is about one-tenth the water resistance. It \nincreases proportionally to the square of the speed.\nAfter the hump resistance is overcome, the float is put in the planing attitude. \nFrom here to take-off, the surface controls must be effective in controlling the trim. \nThe water resistance decreases. It can be controlled by adjusting the float to the \ntrim angle giving maximum resistance.\nThe take-off problem of a seaplane then resolves itself into determining the \ntime and distance of take-off and analyzing the factors affecting the take-off with \na view to improving the performance.\n41. TAKE-OFF CALCULATIONS\nThe calculation of the take-off problem of a seaplane is similar to that of a \nlandplane. The take-off time and distance depend upon the acceleration of the craft \nfrom rest up to the minimum flying speed. The force tending to produce accelera\xad\ntion is the thrust of the propeller. The forces opposing acceleration are those due to \nair and water resistance. The difference between these forces at any instant is the \nactual accelerating force.\nThe minimum speed of flight of the seaplane is fixed by the formula\nminimum velocity equals the square root of W over L of C max times Sminminimum velocity equals the square root of W over L of C max times S\nW\nLCmax · S\n∙']","
The designer ensures that the seaplane does not fall back into the water during take-off by carefully controlling the angle of attack of the wing and the afterbody of the float. Near the end of the take-off, the wing can be pulled up so as to stall off the water at minimum speed, but the afterbody of the float must not touch the water in doing so. Care must be exercised that the seaplane does not fall back into the water due to the low flying speed. In a sea, it may be necessary to stall off the top of a wave. Otherwise, it is customary to consider the minimum speed at take-off at an angle of attack lower than that of maximum lift coefficient, leaving some reserve lift after the float has left the water."
"Based on the MC-1 Engine Project Termination Closeout Report, what were the primary reasons for the project's termination?","The primary reasons for the project's termination were not explicitly stated in the given source material. However, the report did highlight several lessons learned and observations, including the need for adequate budget, schedule, workforce, and reserves committed to a program, the importance of pushing decision-making authority as low as possible, and the need to address mission requirements early and incorporate them into procurement specifications. The report also noted that the project had a change in philosophy from the more Spartan ""faster, better, cheaper"" to ensuring mission success, which imposed additional requirements on the project that increased the cost and added to its schedule. Additionally, the report mentioned that some redesigns of other engine components were in progress at the time of termination, which necessitated modifications in lines and ducts, but none of the changes were driven by lines or ducts issues.","['Promise Denied\n214\nMarshall’s Project Termination Closeout Report\nThe most extensive recounting of the final lessons learned is contained in \nMarshall’s encyclopedic MC-1 Engine Project Termination Closeout Report \nprepared in 2001 in order to document the Fastrac engine project for future \nreference.73 A team of 24 engineers, technicians, and project staff, identified \nas primary authors, conscientiously prepared this admirable report.74 The \ndetails presented in this report serve both as an indication of the high degree \nof interest that project personnel had in preserving their record of accom\xad\nplishments and in providing recommendations and lessons learned for use \nin future projects. \nThe list of 37 “lessons learned” presented below represents selected “high \npoint” lessons learned and observations drawn from the very extensive and \ndetailed list of approximately 190, including their supporting “corollaries.”\n1.\t In-house, hands-on technology demonstration projects are vital to \nsustain the [NASA Marshall] Center’s engineering excellence at the \nleading edge of technological development and should be continued.\n2.\t A program/project must have adequate budget, schedule, workforce, \nand reserves committed to it.\n3.\t The right skill/experience-mix is essential to actually achieve the real\xad\nity of a robust project systems engineering capability.\n4.\t To enable effective project control, a sound work breakdown struc\xad\nture must be developed and implemented as a first step after mission \ndefinition.\n5.\t Failure investigation activity is itself organizationally anomalous; it \nrequires conscientious attention to ensure optimal organizational and \nteam success—beyond just the determination of incident cause and \nrecommended mitigation activity. \n6.\t Major design reviews should be based on design maturity and not a \ncalendar-based milestone schedule. \n7.\t Never underestimate the level of effort required to activate a test stand \n(existing or new) and resolve test preparation issues.\n8.\t To realize the benefits of empowerment, push decision-making \nauthority as low as you can for as long as you can.\n9.\t The [NASA Marshall] Center has some serious cultural issues that \nimpede the ability to honestly communicate and exercise sound proj\xad\nect decision-making.\n10.\t The Center has a systemic problem with growing effective project \nmanagers/leaders.\n11.\t Don’t change horses in midstream; but if you must, the change pro\xad\ncess strategy development and implementation must be impeccable \nto succeed.', 'The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n335\nrequirements of the 60,000 pounds thrust Fastrac engine develop\xad\nment program for the X-34.

These efforts focused on improving the durability of \nthe interpropellant seal package and the elimination of rotating cavitation in \nthe LO2 inducer.6\nDynamic Seals. A series of seals and vent cavities are located between the \noxidizer and the fuel pump inducer/impellers in order to maintain separation \nbetween the propellants. The labyrinth seal controls overboard leakage from \nthe oxidizer pump during operation. The LO2 seal drain cavity collects LO2 \nflowing from the labyrinth seal and helium flowing from the helium buffer seal \nand drains via an external vent to the atmosphere. The fuel seal drain cavity \ncollects fuel flowing from the bellows seal and helium flowing from the helium \nbuffer seal and drains via a vent to the atmosphere. The turbine end face seal \nlimits RP-1 leakage into the turbine from the fuel pump.7\nCombustion Devices\nThe combustion devices of the Fastrac/MC-1 engine include the main injector, \nnozzle, gas generator, gas generator igniter, and thrust chamber assembly igniter. \nThe thrust chamber assembly consisted of a low-cost injector and single-piece \nchamber/nozzle. \nInjector: The Fastrac injector design consists of only three components—an \ninjector body, a gimbal block, and a faceplate. The costs of the Fastrac injectors \nwere approximately $40,000 each, compared to $330,000 for a similar liquid \noxygen/kerosene type then in use.\nEarly tests of the Fastrac injectors [Redacted] resulted in excessive heating \n(streaking) of the [Redacted] combustion chamber material, but the problem \nwas overcome by using a computational fluid dynamic approach. Combustion \nstability of the injector system also was demonstrated in stability tests where \n100\xa0percent over-pressure spike, induced by a pyrotechnic charge, damped \nin the appropriate time. The thrust chamber assembly, which includes the \ninjector and chamber/nozzle also “serves as the engine skeleton since the tur\xad\nbopump, gas generator, and turbine exhaust duct are all mounted directly to \nthe chamber/nozzle. As a result, a test-verified model of the thrust chamber/\nnozzle component is integral to performing the dynamic loads calculation for \nthe engine system…. The chamber/nozzle (referred to as the nozzle) is com\xad\nposed of two main composite layers and several metallic and over-bands…and \nweighs approximately 528 lb.”8', 'The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n337\nspecified for a steady state condition with the fluid dropped on and/\nor flowing through the valve, unless the users are given a hard require\xad\nment for a shorter duration.\n•\t The MC-1 did not address the X-34 range safety requirements until \nlate in the program.

Therefore, some testing was omitted. \n[Redacted] Finding the problem during the engine test phase resulted \nin significant schedule delays and costs impacts associated with engine \ntesting. During the failure investigation, after the seal failures on the \nengine, [Redacted] tests were performed to attempt to duplicate the \nfailure.

Obviously the costs \nand schedule impacts would have been miniscule during the compo\xad\nnent development phase.\n•\t Again, to minimize cost, neither spare valves nor spare parts were \nprocured. This obviously proved to be a problem especially during \nthe engine test phase. The problems experienced during the engine \ntest phase and the lack of spare hardware made logistics of providing \nvalves to the engine difficult. Engines were continuously cannibalized \nto provide valves to the engine currently being tested. The lack of \nspare valves or development valves also hindered engine development']","

"Question: What were the primary motivations for space exploration in the 1990s, and how did they differ from previous decades?","In the 1990s, the primary motivations for space exploration shifted from maintaining international strategic standing to fueling the engines of economic growth. This was a significant departure from previous decades, where motivations for space exploration were often rooted in maintaining international strategic standing, such as during the Cold War. The new focus on economic growth was driven by the global competition in the high-tech economy, and solar system exploration was seen as supporting the high-tech aero­space industry, incubating new technologies, and inspiring young Americans to careers in science and engineering. However, this shift also raised questions about the definition of exploration and the romantic appeal of deep space travel. As we continue to explore the planets, we must ask ourselves why we do it and what we hope to gain from this investment of resources and human capital.","['50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n28\noften rose and fell with the temperature of the Cold War: one heard it often \nin the 1960s, less so amid détente in the 1970s, but then more again in the \n1980s, when Soviet Mars proposals led to jokes about it becoming the Red \nPlanet, in more ways than one.\nThen the Cold War ended. Justifications for space exploration have changed \nover time. In the 1990s, as the superpower standoff gave way to global com\xad\npetition in the high-tech economy, justifications shifted from maintaining \ninternational strategic standing to fueling the engines of economic growth. \nSolar system exploration, in this argument, supported the high-tech aero\xad\nspace industry, incubated new technologies, and, perhaps most important, \ninspired young Americans to careers in science and engineering. \nPerhaps to compensate for the mundane justification of economic com\xad\npetitiveness, the end of the Cold War also encouraged more transcendent \nmotives, in particular the possibility of finding life elsewhere in the cosmos. \nThe search for extraterrestrial life in a way turned solar system exploration \ninto a biology program, which meshed with wider scientific and economic \ninterests in biotechnology. Recall, however, all those American flags waving \naround JPL mission control during the 2012 Curiosity landing and the 2004 \nMars Exploration Rover landings. Space exploration as a vehicle for national \npride and patriotism was not just a Cold War phenomenon. \nAs to the motivation for other spacefaring countries: for the countries of \nEurope, it was perhaps less patriotism and more a way to foster European \nintegration, while balancing American scientific and technological hege\xad\nmony. In Europe, too, economic competitiveness was a motive—that is, \nspace missions were seen as a stimulus, or perhaps a subsidy, for high-tech \nindustry—and even stronger and earlier than in the United States. The same \nwas true for Japan. National pride remains a powerful factor, especially for \nnations experiencing that other key development of the 20th century, post\xad\ncolonialism. For a developing country like India, a space program symbol\xad\nizes status as a modern international power, much as nuclear weapons do. \n(And let us not forget that civil space programs remain a barely veiled signal \nof military space capability.) But in countries like India and China, where \nhundreds of millions of people struggle with desperate poverty despite pell-\nmell modernization, the basic question—is it worth it?—is more acute. How \ncan these countries justify spending a billion dollars on space? \nIn short, motivations for space exploration have reflected the broadest \nhistorical developments of this time: the Cold War, postcolonialism, global \neconomic development, and high-tech industry.\nThese developments explain why we’ve done it. The follow-on question is: \nwhat have we got for it? Some people, like Stuhlinger, like to cite the spinoffs', '99\nCHAPTER 3\u2002 •\u2002 The Politics Of Pure Space Science, The Essential Tension \nsaw catastrophe.21 NASA Administrator James Beggs announced that the \nAgency “would be willing to eliminate its solar system exploration program \naltogether as long as the Space Shuttle and other space projects retained \nadequate funding.”22 The Hubble Space Telescope survived cuts, along with \nGalileo, after much debate and politics. The newly established Planetary \nSociety arose in defense of space science since it was clear that NASA leader\xad\nship’s agenda was to advance human spaceflight before all else.\nSpace science thus entered an awkward era in which missions and vehicles \ngrew larger and larger—becoming, in the words of one critic, “Christmas \ntrees,” loaded with multiple and possibly incompatible instruments. The \nexplanation was simple: because space science missions now had to be \nhuman-rated, their costs grew.\nSadly, the Shuttle program encountered a major crisis when the orbiter \nChallenger exploded during liftoff on 28 January 1986. NASA leadership \nsubsequently maintained a singular focus on “return to flight.” This crisis \nin human spaceflight had implications for space science in several ways. \nUnlike the 1970s, the 1980s were a lost decade for science missions. Only \nMagellan—a Venus radar mission—and Galileo were launched during that \ndecade, both by the Shuttle in 1989. The Hubble Space Telescope had to wait \nuntil 1990 for its launch on the Shuttle.\nThe real budgetary crisis for space science came after another human \nspaceflight initiative, the space station, got under way. Since Nixon’s 1972 \ndecision approving the Shuttle development, NASA had aggressively pur\xad\nsued the space station as the next logical step. The Space Shuttle was intended \nto be a construction and heavy-lifting vehicle, not a test bed for science \nexperiments. Orbiters could be refitted for long-duration missions but were \nincapable of leaving low-Earth orbit for exploration. Supplying the space sta\xad\ntion was the Space Shuttle’s mission, but there was no space station to supply. \nIn 1984, over objections from his staff, President Ronald Reagan proposed \nin his State of the Union address to start a space station program. The ini\xad\ntial proposal was for an $8 billion project to be operational in 1992. Neither \nhappened. As the space station ran through a series of budget projections \nand redesigns that went in opposite directions, the budget went up and the \nnumber of missions for it went down.23\n21.\t Roger Handberg, Reinventing NASA: Human Spaceflight, Bureaucracy, and Politics \n(Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003), pp. 60–61.\n22.\t Snyder, “NASA and Planetary Exploration,” pp. 290–291.\n23.\t Handberg, Reinventing NASA, chapter 4.', '50 YEARS OF SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES\n20\nSpace, or Space 2.0. Most public attention here has focused on the human \nspaceflight program, with SpaceX ferrying supplies to the International \nSpace Station (ISS), and on potential space tourism. But some private groups \nhave also tried to get into the planetary game, from AMSAT (Radio Amateur \nSatellite Corporation) in the 1980s to Astrobotic Technology and other teams \ncompeting for the Google Lunar XPRIZE. \nThe variety of American space institutions leads us to consider which \nother countries have done solar system exploration and why. For much of the \nlast 50 years, it was mostly the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia, \njoined more recently by various European nations, Japan, China, and India. \nWe’ll return to some of these countries in a moment. Let us first note that \ninternational comparisons of, say, the types of people building space\xad\ncraft—their gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic class—might be illuminating. \nConsider the bureaucratic politics of the Soviet Union, with the Ministry \nof General Machine Building (MOM), the Space Research Institute of the \nRussian Academy of Sciences (IKI), and the various design bureaus, and \nhow these dynamics shaped the Soviet space program. Differences include \nrelations between civilian and military space programs. China, for example, \nhas less distinction between civilian and military space institutions—in part \nbecause it followed American suggestions in the late 1970s to embrace the \nU.S. model and integrate the two realms.4\nNations collaborated as well as competed in space, and space exploration \nhas provided fertile ground for diplomatic or international history.5 Looking \nabroad also raises interesting questions about colonialism—that is, colonial\xad\nism here on Earth, not space colonization. One might consider the Soviets \nlaunching spacecraft out of what is now Kazakhstan, or the French launch\xad\ning rockets out of French Guiana.6 Consider also the far-flung tracking sta\xad\ntions of the Deep Space Network, which confronted apartheid at its South \nAfrica site.

Let us add a fourth: why write about the first 50 years of solar system \nexploration? This chapter began with the observation that 50 years of solar \nsystem exploration has taught us a lot about our solar system, but equally \nabout ourselves here on Earth. What does solar system exploration tell us \nabout the last 50 years of history? \nFor example: how does the history of solar system exploration change \nour view of the Cold War, postcolonialism, the information revolution, or \nglobalization and economic development? If the United States is, indeed, \nin strategic decline, or at least facing increasing competition, how are these \ndevelopments shaping solar system exploration? Note that in 2011, amid \nconfusion over U.S. space goals, China announced an aggressive 5-year plan \nfor soft lunar landers and sample returns.24 What about the future of the \nnation-state itself? Will the rise of transnational, multinational, nonstate, or \nsubstate actors introduce new approaches to solar system exploration? For \none thing, it suggests that historians find alternatives to the state-centered \nnarratives we usually use for the Space Age.25, 26 Can we consider how post-\nFordism and postmodernism affected the planetary enterprise? What about \nclimate change? In the 1970s, Malthusian concerns about overpopulation, \nresource scarcity, and pollution sparked calls for space colonization. Will \nglobal climate change similarly encourage solar system exploration? \nHistorians of solar system exploration should be pretty good at big pic\xad\ntures, since our frame of reference is the entire solar system. But we should \nremember to step back occasionally and think about the big historical pic\xad\nture—how our work connects to broader developments. Space history can \nbe an insular field, despite the examples of books like Walter McDougall’s \n…the Heavens and the Earth, which showed how space history can shed light \non fundamental historical changes. Our work should not just speak to other \nspace historians but rather should reach out to general historians, as well as \nthe general public. \n24.\t “China welcomes world’s scientists to collaborate in lunar exploration,” China National \nSpace Administration, 15 January 2019, http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465652/\nn6465653/c6805232/content.html (accessed 7 September 2021).

They have saved the bacon of spacecraft designers on \nseveral occasions, and they have defined the state of the art in telecommuni\xad\ncations and coding theory. They, too, are explorers. \nFinally, “How do we do it?” suggests another basic question. The definition \nof “exploration” often has connotations of novelty. At what point does that \nterm no longer apply to the planets? We no longer talk much about explorers \non Earth—those intrepid souls who ventured across deserts and oceans, or \nto mountain peaks and the poles. This does not mean there is nothing left on \nEarth to explore—far from it—but that we now think of this more as science \nthan exploration. This is a loss. The urge to be first to a place has inspired \nsome of humankind’s most remarkable achievements. Is space exploration \nsimilarly losing its romantic appeal? Consider the names of deep-space mis\xad\nsions. We have gone from Mariner, Ranger, Viking, and Voyager to Mars \nPolar Lander, Mars Climate Orbiter, and Mars Science Laboratory. Romance \ngives way to practicality in many long-term relationships. \nThis development has programmatic implications. Do we revisit one \nplanet, such as Mars, to extend our database, or do we seek new places—\ncomets or asteroids, or outer-planet satellites—for broader knowledge? And \nif space exploration has lost its romantic appeal, how does it inspire the \namazing dedication of the people who build these spacecraft? Will they put \nin 100-hour weeks to launch yet another science lab to Mars? And how about \nthe American public? Will they lose interest when the novelty and romance \nof deep space travel dwindle? Will familiarity breed contempt? And that \nleads us to our next question: why do it?\nWHY DO IT?\nOver the past 50-plus years, NASA has probably spent over $50 billion \nexploring the planets. There is also the investment of human resources: many \nthousands of highly trained and dedicated people, with very valuable skills, \nat NASA Centers, universities, and contractors across the country.

In the 1990s, the primary motivations for space exploration shifted from maintaining international strategic standing to fueling the engines of economic growth. This change was due to the end of the Cold War and the rise of global competition in the high-tech economy. Space exploration was seen as a way to support the aerospace industry, incubate new technologies, and inspire young Americans to careers in science and engineering. Additionally, the end of the Cold War encouraged more transcendent motives, such as the possibility of finding life elsewhere in the cosmos, which turned solar system exploration into a biology program. Economic competitiveness was also a strong motive, with space missions seen as a stimulus for high-tech industry. National pride remained a powerful factor, especially for nations experiencing postcolonialism. For developing countries like India and China, a space program symbolizes status as a modern international power, but the question of whether it is worth the investment remains.

These motivations differed from previous decades as they were less focused on patriotism and strategic standing during the Cold War and more focused on economic growth and the search for life in the cosmos. The 1990s also saw a stronger emphasis on economic competitiveness and high-tech industry compared to previous decades."
What is the typical cost of ISS research facilities that do not require specialized equipment and what are some examples of commercial facilities operating onboard the ISS?,"According to the text, the typical cost of ISS research facilities that do not require specialized equipment is typically just under $100,000. Some examples of commercial facilities operating onboard the ISS include NanoRacks LLC, which was one of the first commercial partners to operate research facilities onboard the ISS. They applied the standardized CubeSat dimensional form factor (10 x 10 x 10 centimeters [~4 x 4 x 4 inches]) to provide ""plug-and-play"" research capabilities aboard the ISS. As of 2018, Nanoracks operates three of these platforms designed for use within the pressurized space station environment. Each is approximately 43 x 23 x 51 centimeters (17 x 9 x 20 inches), weighs approximately 5.5 kilograms (12 pounds), and provides room for up to 16 payloads in the CubeSat form factor. NanoRacks offers complete in-house capabilities for payload integration, payload design and development, and interfacing with NASA and the ISS international partners. The core payload hardware supported by these platforms are called NanoLabs. Every NanoLab has a circuit board that activates the experiment housed within, turns it off, and can be functioned for other activities. A single NanoLab is 1U (i.e., one unit) in size, but the platforms can also support 2U, or 4U or 2 by 4U sizes, with cost varying by the size of the NanoLab. This plug-and-play system uses a simple, standardized interface that reduces payload integration cost and schedule for nanoscale research in microgravity.","['66\nISS that did not require specialized equipment was \ntypically just under $100,000.

Since 2012, commercial research facilities have greatly increased the breadth and \nvolume of ISS-supported research. \n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Partners Expanding \nInternational Space Station  \nResearch Capabilities\nDuring the first six crew rotations aboard the space \nstation, 166 research and technology development \n(R&D) investigations were conducted. During the \nlast six crew rotations (as of May 2018), 416 R&D \ninvestigations were supported. Although the amount \nof crew hours available has increased, the most \nsignificant factor driving this increase is the  \nproliferation of commercial research facilities  \naboard the space station. \nNanoRacks LLC was one of the first commercial \npartners to operate research facilities onboard the ISS. \nBeginning with the installation of the first NanoRacks \nInternal Science Platform in 2010, they applied the \nstandardized CubeSat dimensional form factor  \n(10 x 10 x 10 centimeters [~4 x 4 x 4 inches]) to provide \n“plug-and-play” research capabilities aboard the \nISS. As of 2018, Nanoracks operates three of these \nplatforms designed for use within the pressurized \nspace station environment. Each is approximately  \n43 x 23 x 51 centimeters (17 x 9 x 20 inches), weighs \napproximately 5.5 kilograms (12 pounds), and provides \nroom for up to 16 payloads in the CubeSat form factor. \nNanoRacks offers complete in-house capabilities for \npayload integration, payload design and development, \nand interfacing with NASA and the ISS international \npartners. The core payload hardware supported by \nthese platforms are called NanoLabs. Every NanoLab \nhas a circuit board that activates the experiment \nhoused within, turns it off, and can be functioned \nfor other activities. NanoLabs are plugged into the \nresearch platforms via a normal Universal Serial Bus \n(USB) port, thus allowing data and power to flow and \ncan even be developed by third-party vendors. A single \nNanoLab is 1U (i.e., one unit) in size, but the platforms \ncan also support 2U, or 4U or 2 by 4U sizes, with cost \nvarying by the size of the NanoLab. This plug-and-\nplay system uses a simple, standardized interface \nthat reduces payload integration cost and schedule \nfor nanoscale research in microgravity. \nThrough the standardization of test \nhardware and implementation of \nthe CubeLab approach, the cost of \nconducting research in orbit has been \nreduced as much as threefold...   \nAs of 2018, NanoRacks has supported more than \n300 investigations on the ISS and operates multiple \nfacilities both internally and externally on the space \nstation. Examples of the range of research conducted \nby customers include the NanoRacks-PCG \nTherapeutic Discovery investigation, which tested \nwhether microgravity improved the crystallization \nof two proteins that are important for future treatment \nof heart disease and cancer. The NanoRacks-\nHydrofuge Plant Chamber Experiment aimed to \novercome the behavior of water in microgravity, \nwhich has caused root rot in plant systems. In addition, \ndozens of student-designed payloads from the \nelementary education through graduate student \nlevel have been supported.\nThrough the standardization of test hardware and \nimplementation of the CubeLab approach, the cost \nof conducting research in orbit has been reduced \nas much as threefold between 2006 and 2018, and \naccessibility has greatly increased. In 2006, the cost \nfor conducting educational research projects on the', '67\nAs represented by the examples above, proliferation \nof ISS commercial facilities is ongoing, with processes \nin place to aggressively target, monitor and manage \nlab capacity to ensure the space station maximizes \nthe impact it has on economic, social and innovation \noutcomes. A number of enterprising companies have \ntargeted low-Earth orbit (LEO) and the ISS as integral \nelements of their business plans going forward. \nThe ISS has opened the doors to LEO for commercial \nentities, researchers and scientists. Private industries \ncollaborate with government agencies to provide \nservices and facilities to researchers, taking advantage \nof the space station’s microgravity environment. \nResearch in a Box*\n*Part of this article is reprinted with permission \nfrom Upward Magazine (V2,3),\nNew-to-space companies and investors who have \nnever explored space’s resources are using the ISS \nNational Lab as a platform for innovation, discovery \nand commerce. To support this growth, Kentucky-\nbased Space Tango is filling new demand for \nexpanding space-based research and development \nby paradoxically shrinking labs into something small \nenough to be held in both hands. \nThe space available for R&D on the ISS is significantly \nmore constrained than labs on Earth—access to mass, \nvolume, power and crew time are precious. To address \nthis constraint, Space Tango works with researchers \nto offer the capabilities of a full lab condensed into \na 10-centimeter (4-inch) CubeLab Module. \nBecause many researchers \ndo not have experience in \nspaceflight R&D, Space Tango \nworks with customers to modify \nground-based experiments to \nmeet the demands of the space \nenvironment and make R&D \nobjectives technically feasible. \nFollowing in the footsteps of other companies \nbefore them, an experiment in one of Space Tango’s \nCubeLabs can be “plugged into” the ISS and either \nrun automatically until it returns to Earth or be manually \ncontrolled from the ground. For Space Tango, \nmicrogravity is the next frontier in advancing scientific \ndiscovery and expanding the universe of R&D in space. \nTangoLab-1 arrived on the ISS in August 2016 \nand is roughly a half-meter by half-meter \n(58 x 46-centimeter [~23 x 18-inch) platform \nthat houses up to 21 CubeLabs and provides \npower and communication links for experiments. \nThe TangoLab-2 facility was launched to the ISS \nin August 2017, adding a few new capabilities and \ntaking the number of experiments Space Tango can \naccommodate at a time from 21 to 42—dramatically \nexpanding the number of customers that can \nconduct experiments on the ISS National Lab.\nThe TangoLabs are permanent fixtures on the ISS, \nbut CubeLabs—and thus experiments—can be \nswapped out so that experiments can be repeated \nas is or modified in real time to meet the needs of \nthe investigator. Each 10 x 10 x 10-centimeter \n(~4 x 4 x 4-inch) CubeLab makes up a unit—known \nas a U—and can house a single experiment, whether \nit is from the life sciences, material sciences, or another \nfield of study. Alternatively, an experiment can take up \n2U, 4U or even 6U, if needed. CubeLabs also contain \nthe necessary attachments required for experiments, \nsuch as LED lights or imaging equipment.Flight Engineer Mark Vande Hei swaps out a payload card from the TangoLab-1 facility and places it into the TangoLab-2 facility.

Even the procurement mechanisms employed \ncan be tailored to maximize the transfer of expertise needed to confidently conduct business \nin space and encourage economic development.\nIn the table that follows, examples are provided for the humankind and economic benefits generated \nby the International Space Station (ISS). Navigant Consulting, Inc. findings were the primary source \nfor these value examples, with the exception of two cases. Details for Amgen and Tropical Cyclone \nwere already available and therefore not assigned to Navigant for analysis. When practical and \nuseful, details of the findings were further vetted through the international partners and commercial \nentities associated. \nThe second table provides descriptions of the commercial research facilities on the ISS. The majority \nof these facilities (14/15) entered service after the assembly of the space station was completed \nin 2011, with more than half (8/15) coming on-line in the 1.5 years leading up to this publication \n(2017-2018). Thus, it is important to remember that the cases presented derived from research \nactivities are early-return benefits. As more time passes, and research efforts continue unabated, \nthe number and value of the benefits returned to Earth will continue to grow. \nFindings and Providers\nThe Summaries of Valuation Findings table starting \non the next page summarizes the valuation findings \navailable to the authors. The findings presented \nshow how value is derived not only from the \nplanned research, but also from the engineering \naccomplishments and technology required to \noperate the space station, perform research, and \nmaintain a safe living environment for the crew. \nThe ISS Commercial Research Providers table lists \nsome of the key commercially managed research \nfacilities onboard the space station. Information \nprovided indicates the year of operational start-\nup as well as a brief description of the facility \ncapabilities. A quick perusal of this table illustrates \nthat commercially managed facilities are a recent \ndevelopment, with the first such facility beginning \noperations in 2010. Also, the fact that three of these \nfacilities came on line in the first half of 2018, literally \nas this section was being drafted, accurately portrays \nthe ongoing proliferation of such facilities over the \nnext several years.', '17\nis allocated 50% of NASA’s ISS resources with the \ngoal of maximizing commercial and private research \nconducted on the space station. Between 2012 and \n2017, they selected 190 investigations to be carried \nout on the ISS; of these, 56% were commercially \nsponsored, 42% were academic/nonprofit sponsored, \nand only 2% were government sponsored.\nThe results of the efforts of all partners toward \ncommercial research and partnership can be seen \nin the findings documented in the table below. Many \nof the most mature benefits listed were derived from \nearly collaborative public-private partnerships including \nAquaporin water purification technology, Aerocide \nair-scrubbing technology and Aerocrine’s exhaled nitric \noxide monitors. In addition, commercial research from \npharmaceutical companies have led to the osteoporosis \ndrug Denosumab (Prolia). As discussed in the Japanese \npartner perspective, pharmaceutical companies’ \ninterest in ISS research continues to grow. Ongoing \nand planned testing has the potential to impact a \nwide range of treatments and even demonstrate \nthe effectiveness of new drug delivery systems. \nAs the demand for space research and development \nprojects increases, numerous commercial companies \nare developing, operating and maintaining their own \ncommercial payload facilities, both internally and \nexternally on the ISS. To date, 15 commercial research \nfacilities and instruments have greatly increased the \nbreadth of research supported by the ISS, with the \nmajority becoming available since 2014. Currently \nAlphaSpace, BioServe, Made In Space, NanoRacks, \nSpace Tango, StaARS, TechShot, and Teledyne Brown \nEngineering are providing ISS research facilities. \nAs mentioned in their partner perspective below, \nthe first European Space Agency (ESA)-sponsored \ncommercial facility, ICECUBES, began operations in \n2018. A listing of all commercial facilities available \nas of June 2018, and a brief description of their \ncapabilities, can be found in ISS Commercial \nResearch Providers table at the end of this section. \nThese commercial organizations operate their facilities \nand provide users with more choices to address unique \nresearch needs than were previously available. \nMany of these companies have used their own \nresources to invest in on-orbit facilities, thereby \nreducing the risk to the ISS research partner agencies \nto develop these facilities and services themselves. \nThese companies find customers through the ISS \npartners, the ISS National Laboratory and their own \nbusiness development efforts. As commercial facilities \nhosting ISS research have proliferated, the cost of \nconducting that research in orbit has dropped by a \nfactor of three. The combination of increased capacity \nand decreased cost has improved accessibility of space \nstation research to new user groups such as academic \ninstitutions and educational non-profits, thereby \nallowing graduate and undergraduate students to \nparticipate in space-based research, as well as to \nsecondary and primary school students to experience \nspace-based research. \n...commercial companies are \ndeveloping, operating and \nmaintaining their own commercial \npayload facilities, both internally \nand externally on the ISS. \nIn less than a decade after assembly completion, \nthe ISS has become a fully functioning laboratory \nwhere commercial entities routinely carry out research \nand technology development (R&D) in fields important \nto their competitive differentiation. Another area in \nwhich the ISS is contributing to the development of the \nspace economy is payload integration. The Research, \nEngineering, Mission and Integration Services (REMIS) \ncontract is another example of the transition in ISS \nprocurement philosophy to emphasize public-\nprivate partnerships. This contract was awarded to \n16 contractors in September 2017. This move signals \na transition from a model where NASA provides its \nown payload integration, engineering development \nand sustaining services to one where those services \ncan be purchased from one of many commercial \nproviders through a competitive process. The REMIS \ncontract was developed to allow companies to slowly \ntake over historically governmental functions in a step-\nwise manner using their commercial approaches to \ndoing business. \nThe ISS is not a traditional asset where concepts such \nas return on investment (ROI), payback period or risk-\nadjusted return are easily applied. By allowing industry \nto take over payload integration functions as well as \nown and manage research facilities, the ISS serves \nas a technology-transfer conduit for the “how-to” \nexperience companies will need to expand their \nactivities in space. At the same time, competition \nbetween companies often generates more efficient \napproaches leading to price reductions, further \nreducing the costs of doing business in space.']","
The typical cost of ISS research facilities that do not require specialized equipment is just under $100,000. As of 2018, NanoRacks advertised charges of $35,000 for a basic NanoLabs CubeLab module, which includes filing the necessary paperwork, manifesting the payload on an ISS resupply vehicle, installing the equipment, and taking care of all government relations for the research, with a standard 30 days of research on an ISS facility.

Some examples of commercial facilities operating onboard the ISS include:

1. BioServe's Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory (SABL): A commercial facility that can support a range of investigations across life sciences, physical sciences, and materials sciences.
2. Teledyne Brown Engineering's Multiple User System for Earth Sensing Facility (MUSES): A commercial research facility housed externally on the ISS that provides many commercial companies the opportunity to conduct their science and research in space.
3. Veggie: A low-cost plant growth chamber developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation’s wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) in Madison, Wis., through a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Program. Veggie uses a flat-panel light bank that includes red, blue, and green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for plant growth and crew observation."

The DOX having a gross weight \nof over 100,000 lbs., although built as a commercial airplane with a much \nshorter range, may be considered the prototype of this class of airplanes. The \nBritish have already built an airplane along this line, the Short six-engine \nflying boat (gross weight about 70,000 lbs.), and there are evidences that \nother foreign governments are seriously considering similar developments.\n3.\t The military advantages and additional uses for such a type airplane over \nany patrol planes now in service or under development in this country \nshould be obvious. For long range patrol and scouting purposes, especially \nfor operating across the Pacific, such a type would be invaluable.

Like the PB4Y-1 that had preceded it, this was \na land-based, over-water reconnaissance aircraft, not a patrol boat, derived from \nthe Army’s B-24 Liberator. Eventually, nearly one thousand PB4Y–1s flew for the \nNavy. The PB4Y-2, another variant of the B-24 known as the “Privateer,” started \nflying for the Navy in early 1944. It had a longer fuselage than the PB4Y-1 and a \nsingle vertical stabilizer. The “4Y–2s” patrolled the central Pacific out to Borneo, \nIndochina, Singapore, and the southern coast of China. Their mission was to con\xad\nduct long-range reconnaissance to prevent the undetected approach of enemy forces \nand to destroy enemy ships. Several VPB squadrons earned citations for outstand\xad\ning heroism in action against the Japanese late in the war. But, again, these were not \nseaplanes.

Equipped with new \nNorden bombsights, the speedy new patrol bombers of World War II did much \nmore than scout for the fleet; they could—and often did—fight their way through \nto deliver heavy blows to enemy targets on both sea and land. By war’s end, Navy \nflying boats were responsible for saving countless American lives, sinking several \nhundred thousand tons of enemy ships, and making invaluable contributions to the \nAllied cause in the Pacific. But this performance did, in fact, mark the twilight of \nan era. After the war, uses for flying boats would diminish greatly.

There is no indication of marked perfor\xad\nmance improvement as long as design practice adheres to present conventional \nstandards. The following report has been prepared to outline in general terms a \nlogical, basic procedure for developing a series of flying boat arrangements wherein \nthese disadvantages are minimized or in some cases eliminated.', '257\nDocument 5-19 (a–c)\nIn the PN-12, therefore, is incorporated all of the latest proven structural and \naerodynamic features applicable to this type of plane, including metal construc\xad\ntion throughout air cooled engines, and complete navigational and radio equip\xad\nment, including radio compass and arrangements for sending and receiving when \non the water.

This increase has \nbeen effected by a combination of lighter weight, due to metal construction and air \ncooled engines, increased aerodynamical efficiency, and increased engine power. At \nthe same time there has been a considerable increase in the fixed equipment item of \nthe weight empty, due to additional navigational, electrical and other equipment.\nThe peacetime crew of this plane consists of four men as follows: Pilot, \nnavigator-bomber, radio operator, and mechanic-gunner.

What are the three categories of V/STOL aircraft and how do they differ in terms of power required for cruising flight?,"The three categories of V/STOL aircraft are:
1. Pure helicopters: These use rotors for both lift and propulsion in cruise. However, requiring the helicopter rotor to provide both lift and propulsion in cruising flight results in problems of retreating blade stall and advancing blade compressibility effects which increase the rotor profile power requirements of the helicopter and limit its cruising speed.

2. Conventional aircraft using wing lift and separate propulsion in cruise: These operate as conventional aircraft using wing lift and separate propulsion in cruise, and for these the same rules for obtaining good cruise performance that have always applied to conventional aircraft still apply, namely, aerodynamic cleanliness to reduce parasite drag and power and a wing designed for the desired cruising altitude and speed to minimize the induced power.

3. Combination configurations (the compound or unloaded helicopter): These are also known as unloaded helicopters or tilt rotors. In these configurations, the propulsion job is taken over by separate propellers or ducted fans and part of the lift is transferred to a wing; thus, the rotor is unloaded and the speed capability is increased. However, the parasite drag of the rotor and pylon remains, with the result that the power required remains above that of more conventional aircraft.

In terms of power required for cruising flight, the pure helicopter requires the most power due to the problems of retreating blade stall and advancing blade compressibility effects. The conventional aircraft using wing lift and separate propulsion in cruise requires less power due to the use of wing lift and separate propulsion, and the combination configurations (the compound or unloaded helicopter) require less power than pure helicopters but more power than conventional aircraft due to the parasite drag of the rotor and pylon.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n748\nCRUISE PERFORMANCE\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn figure 4 the power required for 40,000-pound cargo-type aircraft operating \nat sea level is plotted as a function of speed. V/STOL aircraft can be classified in \nthree categories: those that use rotors for both lift and propulsion in cruise (the pure \nhelicopters), those that operate as conventional aircraft using wing lift and separate \npropulsion in cruise, and combination configurations (the compound or unloaded \nhelicopter). Requiring the helicopter rotor to provide both lift and propulsion in \ncruising flight results in problems of retreating blade stall and advancing blade \ncompressibility effects which increase the rotor profile power requirements of the \nhelicopter and limit its cruising speed.\nIn the compound configuration the propulsion job is taken over by separate \npropellers or ducted fans and part of the lift is transferred to a wing; thus the rotor \nis unloaded and the speed capability is increased. The parasite drag of the rotor and \npylon remains, however, with the result that the power required remains above that \nof more conventional aircraft.\nThe other V/STOL aircraft cruise on wing lift, and for these the same rules \nfor obtaining good cruise performance that have always applied to conventional \naircraft still apply, namely, aerodynamic cleanliness to reduce parasite drag and \npower and a wing designed for the desired cruising altitude and speed to minimize \nthe induced power.\nGood aerodynamic design is important not only at the highest speeds but \nthroughout the speed range because most aircraft cruise in the speed range near the \nmaximum lift-drag ratio where the span is important. A large wing span is needed \nto minimize induced drag and therefore power, as can be deduced from the expres\xad\nsion of figure 1. A clean aerodynamic design is needed to minimize power through\xad\nout the speed range. A good case in point is the helicopter where the high parasite \ndrag of current configurations is largely responsible for the difference in power \nbetween the helicopter and the airplane as shown in figure 4 near the speed for \nhelicopter minimum power. This point is discussed more completely in reference 3.\nThe power required for the V/STOL aircraft in cruise is a little greater than \nthat for the conventional airplane because of the reduction in propulsive efficiency \nwhich results from the fact that the propulsion units must also be designed to pro\xad\nvide the lift in hovering for most V/STOL configurations; thus, a compromise in \nthe design must be made.\nPROPULSIVE EFFICIENCY COMPROMISE\nEach V/STOL type has a different propulsion-hovering design compromise. \nAn example of one such design compromise for the propeller-driven V/STOL air\xad\ncraft is shown in figure 5.

Zimmerman, Langley Research Center, \n“Summary of V/STOL State of the Art,” \nNASA Conference on V/STOL Aircraft, pp. 335–345.\nIt is the purpose of this paper to summarize briefly the major points which have \nbeen presented in the preceding papers to aid the designer in forming an overall \npicture of the status of research on V/STOL aircraft and to present some of the \nneeds for future research in this area.\nThe basic aerodynamic principles which govern aircraft design have been \nreviewed briefly and the mission capabilities of various V/STOL types have been \npresented in figures 1 and 2 [not reproduced]. It can be seen that the conventional \nhelicopter, which was the only practicable aircraft capable of hovering when power \nplants were relatively heavy and bulky, remains the most desirable configuration \nwhen hovering is a major part of the mission. Because of considerations of rotor-\nblade stall, rotor-hub drag, and rotor instabilities, helicopters are not well suited to \nachievement of high speeds or large ranges. However, the power required in cruising \ncan be greatly reduced by careful attention to drag reduction as compared with the \npower required when drag has been given little or no consideration. This decrease \nin drag will make possible both the achievement of a reasonably large ferry range \nfor the helicopter and a substantial increase in its productivity in normal\xa0missions.\nThe speed limitation imposed by rotor-blade stall can be alleviated by transfer\xad\nring the propulsion function from the rotor to propellers and using a fixed wing to \ncarry a large percentage of the weight in high-speed flight. The drag of the rotor and \ntendencies toward rotor instabilities remain serious problems and have caused many \nengineers to look for more suitable configurations where high speed and long range \nare the primary considerations and hovering is necessary only for the short time \nperiods required to permit vertical take-offs and landings. Years of research, design, \ndevelopment, and experience have resulted in the conventional high-aspect-ratio, \npropeller-driven, subsonic airplane configuration as the one most suitable where \nrange, efficiency, and operational flexibility [are] necessary and speeds greater than \n400 knots are not required. It has been natural therefore to attempt to add to this \nconfiguration the capability of vertical take-off and landing.\nFigure 3 [not reproduced] shows a family of V/STOL aircraft which represent \nvarious approaches to this general solution. In this figure are four wing-propulsion \nsystems which have been proposed. It has been assumed that a given load is to be \ncarried in a given cargo-type fuselage. This fuselage requires substantially the same \nstabilizing and control means regardless of the wing-propulsion system and will \nobviously require the same lifting and thrust forces for its sustentation and propul\xad\nsion. With the exception of the tilt-rotor aircraft, the aircraft shown have roughly \nthe same effective span in cruising flight and the same downwash velocity when \nhovering if the same gross weight is assumed. The tilt-rotor configuration has a \nlower effective span and a lower hovering downwash velocity.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n744\na helicopter’s performance. By the early days of NASA, an increasing number of \nV/STOL advocates felt that a better approach might be to bypass the problems of \nthe conventional helicopter and go after some sort of convertiplane based on the \ntilt-rotor. Such craft would need much less runway area and therefore could ease \ncongestion at airports by enabling aircraft to take off from various spots around \na city, including from the city center and even from on top of buildings. Skeptics \nargued that tilt-rotors posed even more problems in the form of increased weight \nand greater mechanical complexity. Aerodynamically, their rotors and wings still \nseemed all too susceptible to major aeroelasticity problems. Overall, the problems \nof “conversion” or “transition” from vertical to horizontal flight and back again just \nseemed too daunting.\nDocument 5-48 (a), Richard E.

November 17–18, 1960 (NASA, 1960), pp. 1–17.\nSUMMARY\nThis paper reviews the principal factors that determine the performance of \nV/STOL aircraft. These can be summarized as follows. In hovering, the power \nrequired, the fuel consumption, and the downwash dynamic pressure are all deter\xad\nmined by and increase with increasing slipstream area loading. In transition the \nwing span, the distribution of load on that span, and the power required in hover\xad\ning determine the shape of the power-required curve and through this the engine-\nout safety and STOL performance. In cruise some compromises are required but, \ngenerally, the same rules for designing good cruise performance into conventional \nairplanes still apply to V/STOL configurations, namely, attention to aerody\xad\nnamic cleanliness to reduce the \nparasite power and a wing of \nappreciable span to reduce the \ninduced power.\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring the past few years \na great variety of V/STOL type \naircraft have been proposed and \ninvestigated. The choice among \nthese of a particular V/STOL \nconfiguration to fill a given \nmission will depend largely Figure 1: Power Required in Steady Level Flight.

1. Pure helicopters: These aircraft use rotors for both lift and propulsion in cruise. The rotor profile power requirements increase due to retreating blade stall and advancing blade compressibility effects, which limits their cruising speed.
2. Conventional aircraft using wing lift and separate propulsion in cruise: These aircraft operate like traditional aircraft during cruising flight, with lift provided by the wing and propulsion by separate engines. They have lower power requirements compared to pure helicopters in cruising flight.
3. Compound or unloaded helicopter: These aircraft use separate propellers or ducted fans for propulsion and transfer part of the lift to a wing, unloading the rotor. While this increases their speed capability, the parasite drag of the rotor and pylon remains, resulting in higher power requirements compared to more conventional aircraft.

The power required for cruising flight is highest for pure helicopters due to the increased rotor profile power requirements. Conventional V/STOL aircraft using wing lift and separate propulsion in cruise have lower power requirements, while compound or unloaded helicopters have higher power requirements than conventional aircraft due to the parasite drag of the rotor and pylon."
"What are the four wing-propulsion systems shown in Figure 3 of the document and what are their respective advantages and disadvantages in terms of effective span, hovering downwash velocity, and load-carrying capability?","The four wing-propulsion systems shown in Figure 3 of the document are:

1. Rotor lift and propulsion (helicopter)
2. Combination (compound helicopter)
3. Wing lift, separate propulsion
4. Jet pump

The rotor lift and propulsion (helicopter) system has the highest effective span and 
highest hovering downwash velocity due to the use of rotors for both lift and propulsion. 
 <|>
However, this system has limitations in terms of speed capability due to problems of retreating blade stall and advancing blade compressibility effects, which increase the rotor profile power requirements and limit its cruising speed.

The combination (compound helicopter) system is a variation of the rotor lift and propulsion system, where the propulsion job is taken over by separate propellers or ducted fans, and part of the lift is transferred to a wing. This system has a lower effective span and lower hovering downwash velocity compared to the rotor lift and propulsion system, but it provides a compromise in terms of speed capability.

The wing lift, separate propulsion system has a lower effective span and lower hovering downwash velocity compared to the rotor lift and propulsion system and the combination (compound helicopter) system. However, this system has a lower power required for hovering due to the reduction in propulsive efficiency, which results from the fact that the propulsion units must also be designed to provide the lift in hovering for most V/STOL configurations.

The jet pump system has the lowest effective span and the highest hovering downwash velocity due to the use of jet engines for propulsion. However, this system has a very high fuel consumption, and hovering time must be restricted to the 1½ to 2 minutes required for take-off and landing.
In terms of load-carrying capability, the rotor lift and propulsion system and the combination (compound helicopter) system have the highest load-carrying capability due to the use of rotors for lift. However, the wing lift, separate propulsion system has a lower load-carrying capability due to the reduction in propulsive efficiency.
Overall, the choice of wing-propulsion system depends on the specific mission requirements and the desired length of hovering time.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n748\nCRUISE PERFORMANCE\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn figure 4 the power required for 40,000-pound cargo-type aircraft operating \nat sea level is plotted as a function of speed.

For best static thrust a relatively large amount of camber, \nas indicated by the design section lift coefficient, is required. With a lot of camber,', '747\nDocument 5-48 (a–e)\nFUEL CONSUMPTION\nTwo other quan\xad\ntities are of concern in \nhovering: the fuel con\xad\nsumption, which is \ndirectly proportional \nto the power required, \nand the downwash \ndynamic \npressure, \nwhich is one-half the \nslipstream area load\xad\ning. These are plotted \nin figure 3.\nThe leaders from \nthe \nconfiguration \nsketches in figure 3 do \nnot indicate a specific \npoint but rather the \ngeneral area in which \ncurrent practice usually places these configurations. All V/STOL configurations \nexcept jet pump schemes, which are not considered here, fall in one general band.\nTurbojet and turbofan configurations, which were omitted from figure\xa0 2 \nbecause these engines are not usually thought of in terms of horsepower, are \nincluded in figure 3. If these configurations were presented in terms of power they \nwould fall at or above the top edge of figure 2. These configurations have very high \nfuel consumption; one hour of hovering would burn a weight of fuel almost equal \nto the weight of the aircraft. Therefore, with these configurations, hovering time \nmust be restricted to the 1½ to 2 minutes required for take-off and landing.\nObviously if long hovering time is required, a rotor configuration is dictated. \nA more complete discussion of power required and fuel consumption in hovering is \npresented in reference 1.\nDOWNWASH\nA point of concern with V/STOL aircraft is the effect of the downwash from these \naircraft on the ground under the aircraft. The average downwash from unshrouded \nconfigurations is equal to the disk loading and that from shrouded configurations \nis equal to one-half the exit-area loading. Experience has shown that loose sand and \ndirt will be blown up by helicopters with disk loadings, and therefore downwash \ndynamic pressures, as low as 2 to 3 pounds per square foot. On the other hand, good \nsod can withstand downwash dynamic pressures as high as 1,000 to 2,000 pounds \nper square foot. The downwash problem is discussed more fully in reference 2.\nFIGURE 3. Fuel consumption in hovering.Figure 3: Fuel Consuption in Hovering with rotor, propeller, ducted fan, buried fan, turbofan, and turbojet labelled.

The applicability of the three types \nhaving lower disc loadings to certain missions would depend on the required length \nof hovering time, in view of the wide variation in hovering fuel rate shown.\nDownwash velocities generated in hovering at sea level are shown in Fig. 9 \n[not reproduced]. Again, operational requirements might be expected to determine \nhow high a disc loading could be tolerated from the standpoint of kinetic energy \nin the hovering downwash. It is unlikely that ground personnel could continue to \nfunction in downwash velocities much above 75 mph. (Adding an optimum duct \nor shroud to a propeller effects an appreciable reduction in downwash energy and \nvelocity in the hovering condition; this effect has not been included in the analysis.)\nc. Results of Forward Flight Analysis\nThe variation in maximum speed found for the various designs is plotted in \nFig. 10 [not reproduced] for an altitude of 15,000 feet. The resulting trend is almost \nentirely due to the differences in the installed power required for the several designs. \nThis is borne out by the dashed curve which demonstrates that almost the same \nmaximum speed would be attained by all four designs if each had the same installed \npower. This occurs because all provide nearly equal propulsive efficiencies in this \nparticular flight condition. The drop in efficiency indicated by the speed decrease \nfor the 160 lb/sq ft disc loading case occurs because its propellers become somewhat \nunderloaded for the reduced power assumed for the dashed curve of Fig.\xa010.\nFig. 11 [not reproduced] shows the cruise performance calculated for the vari\xad\nous designs at 15,000 feet, with 10,000 pounds of fuel assumed available for cruise. \nIt may be seen that the trend is fairly uniform among the types, and that if a very \nhigh cruise speed is desired, the higher disc loadings must be used, or at least the \nhigh installed power levels corresponding to those assumed for the high disc load\xad\ning designs must be provided. If speed requirements are \nmore moderate, in the 250–350 knot range, then a low \ndisc loading design offers an appreciable improvement \nin range. This analysis indicates that large-diameter \nslow-turning propellers can be at least as efficient in \ncruise at medium speeds as smaller propellers of greater \nsolidity such as proposed for many VTOL designs.\nAn appreciable part of the differences that show up \nin the range comparison, as well as the break in each \ncurve of Fig. 11, is due to the assumed variation of spe\xad\ncific fuel consumption with percentage of maximum \npower output used in cruise. The values used in the \nanalysis were [in the table at right]:\nThese values represent operation of modern turbine \nengines in each aircraft, with the normal increase for \nturbines being used down to 60% of maximum power. \n% of \nMaximum \nPower \nOutput\nBrake Specific \nFuel Con\xad\nsumption (lbs/\nshaft hp-hr)\n100 \n.50\n90 \n.51\n80 \n.53\n70 \n.56\n60 \n.60\n50 \n.60\n40\n.62\n30 \n.64\n(1)\n.67', '597\nDocument 5-40\nThe above enumeration of only the main requirements shows that for the prob\xad\nlem of the ideal rotating-wing aircraft there exists no surprise solution by any inven\xad\ntion, patent, or Columbus egg, but that only one way is open, that of making a \nthorough study with equal care of the many diversified questions and taking them \nall into consideration in the design. Many of the questions such as the extensive sta\xad\nbility investigations are of an entirely theoretical character. Others, for example, the \nproblems of simple manipulation and control, are primarily of a practical nature. \nBetween these are to be found the difficult problems in connection with the con\xad\nstruction of the aircraft parts.\nThe production of lift of a propeller.—The generation of a propeller thrust \nwhich is here equivalent to lift offers nothing particularly new. The computation \nhas been performed so often and so \nthoroughly that little remains to be \nadded. The three-blade propeller of \ntapered plan form was also subjected \nto extensive wind tunnel investiga\xad\ntions both as a helicopter and as an \nautogiro propeller. Figure 1 shows a \nmodel of this three-blade propeller \ndriven by a three-horsepower electric \nmotor. The outfit rests on the wind-\ntunnel scales, which measure all air \nforces and moments.\nThe measurements require great care since there are many sources of distur\xad\nbance, the details of which cannot be individually discussed here. One essential \ncircumstance will be mentioned, however, since it also has a direct bearing on \npractical helicopter flight, and that is ground effect. On approaching a sufficiently \nlarge horizontal plane there is a considerable increase in the thrust and to a smaller \nextent also in the torque of a pro\xad\npeller, as soon as the distance \nbecomes comparable with the \npropeller diameter. In practice \nthis effect is very marked. With \na given throttle setting the heli\xad\ncopter lifts off the ground, but \nwith no more power supplied to \nthe engine, does not rise above a \nfew meters. A helicopter without \nsufficiently great excess power \nwill never rise above this “float\xad\ning level.” On the other hand, \nthis phenomenon gives rise to a Photo of a model of a three-blade propeller driven by a three-horsepower electric motor. It is ready for tests in a wind tunnel.\nFIGURE 1. Model of three-blade propeller driven by a 3 \nhp. electric motor for tests in wind tunnel.Graph showing the results of Flachsbart on the ground effect on a propeller.\nFIGURE 2. Results of Flachsbart on the ground effect on a \npropeller.', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n368\nIn Proposal 7b, the wing is gulled quite abruptly in order to provide adequate \npropeller clearance for conventional take-off technique. This incorporates the seri\xad\nous disadvantage of increased wing structural weight. A solution to this problem \nhas been presented in Proposal 7a where jet propulsion is used to provide all of \nthe thrust over the hump until planing is established. In this case the engines are \nstarted but remain declutched from the propellers which are locked in the position \nfor maximum clearance. When planing has been established, the propellers are \nengaged and take-off proceeds in a normal fashion.\nThis later arrangement is probably more suited for very large designs where aux\xad\niliary tugs or power are provided for maneuvering on the water into take-off\xa0position.\nDue to the promising nature of this low aspect ratio type of hydrofoil, a series \nof towing basin tests and models are being prepared for test in the near future.\nPROPOSAL NO. 8\nCONVENTIONAL TWIN HULL\nThis arrangement shows considerable promise, particularly in the larger sizes \nwhere the wing center section can be used to advantage to house cargo and crew. \nHere it is possible to utilize hulls of very high length-beam ratio and low resistance. \nFigure 10 presents the resistance characteristics for twin hulls of high length-beam \nratio and includes a conventional single hull of L over BL over BL over B\xa0=\xa06.0 for comparison. Table\xa0II \nlists the characteristics for comparison with the basic single hull proposal.\nAside from a marked decrease in hump resistance, the aerodynamic drag of the \nwing tip floats is eliminated completely. As flying boats increase in size, these floats \nbecome extremely large and the wing weight is increased appreciably to support \ntheir weight and reactions.\nAs a result of the favorable wing beam characteristics due to the twin hull reac\xad\ntions, it is possible to utilize higher wing aspect ratios with this arrangement and \nstill maintain the same maximum bending moments. This will result in a decrease \nin aerodynamic drag.\nDue to the inherently high transverse static stability, this arrangement will be \nexceptionally seaworthy in the event of forced landings.\nAdditional studies are being made of the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics of \nthis arrangement.\nPROPOSAL NO. 9\nVENTNOR TYPE TWIN HULL\nProposal 9 is similar to Proposal 3 except that the twin hull system is utilized. \nBecause of the inherent favorable spray characteristics, it is possible to locate the \npropellers close to the static water surface.']","
1. Tilt-rotor aircraft: This configuration has a lower effective span and a lower hovering downwash velocity compared to the other aircraft shown in Figure 3. The tilt-rotor design allows for vertical take-off and landing while maintaining a high-aspect-ratio wing for efficient cruising flight. However, the complexity of the tilt-rotor mechanism and the need for a more complex control system can be seen as disadvantages.
2. Tilt-wing aircraft: This configuration features wings that can rotate around a central axis, allowing for vertical take-off and landing while maintaining a high-aspect-ratio wing for efficient cruising flight. The tilt-wing design provides good load-carrying capability and efficient cruising flight, but the complexity of the tilting mechanism and the need for a more complex control system can be seen as disadvantages.
3. Tail-sitter aircraft: This configuration features a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability with a high-aspect-ratio wing for efficient cruising flight. The tail-sitter design provides good load-carrying capability and efficient cruising flight, but the need for a complex tail-first landing and take-off procedure can be seen as a disadvantage.
4. Lift-plus-cruise aircraft: This configuration features separate lift and cruise systems, typically with a large number of small lift engines and a smaller number of high-thrust cruise engines. The lift-plus-cruise design provides good load-carrying capability and efficient cruising flight, but the complexity and weight of the multiple lift engines can be seen as disadvantages.

It is important to note that the figure and the specific details of the aircraft are not provided in the text, so the answer is based on general knowledge of the different wing-propulsion systems."
"According to the passage, what is the relationship between technical complication and technical progress? Is technical complication considered a pure evil or a necessary ingredient of technical progress? Explain your answer with reference to the text.","The passage discusses the Contour mission and the subsequent investigation into its failure. The report of the Contour Mishap Investigation Board identified three root causes, including the project's reliance on ""analyses by similarity,"" inadequate systems engineering processes, and inadequate reviews. The report also identified significant observations, such as the lack of telemetry during a critical event, significant reliance on subcontractors without adequate oversight, and limited understanding of plume heating environments for the solid rocket motor in space. The passage also highlights the disconnect between the PI and the project manager, with the PI not being invited into some of the reviews of the mishap. The memories of those involved in the mission also differed about the fundamental issues of the solid rocket motor. While Project Manager Mary Chiu thought it was near the end of its lifetime, Farquhar, who described the CONTOUR disaster data captured by military assets, believed that something catastrophic had occurred. Overall, the passage suggests that technical complication, in this case, the solid rocket motor, can lead to significant issues and failures, and inadequate systems engineering processes and reviews can exacerbate these problems.","['133\nDocument 5-8 (a–b)\nNot each scientific inspiration and technical progress involves an increase of \ncomplication.

We may \nrequire more ease of operation and be entirely prepared to pay the price for it in way \nof more complication. German mentality is very different from American mental\xad\nity. Their social structure is different. Their system of education is very different. \nIt all brings about the result that Germans are better fitted and prepared to assume \nthe functions of machines, and Americans are better fitted and prepared to oper\xad\nate machines and to cope with their complications. An airship ideal for German \nrequirements may be too primitive for the needs of this country. The question of \ncomplication should be carefully weighed with this in mind, before new design \nprinciples for airships are condemned.\nI enter now into the discussion of specific problems of progressive airship \nresearch, which discussion, I hope, will demonstrate the abundance of such prob\xad\nlems, and the corresponding brightness of the prospect for airship improvement. I \nbegin with the problems most engineering-like in character, and gradually advance \ntowards more abstract science.\nI mention first the question of automatic control of airships. Surface ships and \nairplanes have been successfully and advantageously controlled automatically, and \nthis may also be desirable for airships. It may result in smaller airloads on the \nstructure and in larger security and comfort of travel. This large research project \nis still untouched in many respects, and recommends itself to the attention of the \nresearch\xa0engineer.\nThe broad idea is not new. There is a patent issued to Dr. Klemperer having \nreference to automatic control. Dr. Klemperer in his specification recommended', '879\nDocument 5-54\nRefuting the negatives were measurements with lifting surfaces that demon\xad\nstrated feasibility, followed by manned glider flights. Now the focus was on fixed \nwings. There was obvious progress in this approach, and the reasoned view put \npriority on this form of flight. While there was convergence toward practical fixed \nwing flight, helicopter advocates had to wait longer to show comparable progress.\nThe second feature listed above referred to technical progress itself in tech\xad\nnology creation. In the long view technological innovation has proceeded along a \nline that can be seen as logarithmic. There were “bursts” of innovation along the \nway, and periods of stagnation. (One author postulated “geniuses” through history \nappeared in clusters.) “Stagnation” refers to periods when the status-quo resisted \nsuch progress. Even so, such a curve describes the general trend. Until the Second \nWorld War the creation and diffusion of knowledge was relatively slow. That war \nrepresents the bend in the curve that shoots upward (the eminence of stimulus \ndiffusion). One could argue the bend existed in the First World War. In terms of \nhuman history the 25 year difference is not significant.\nThe idea of the wheel is at least 5000 years old, and carts and four wheel wag\xad\nons are just as old. However it was not until about 800 A.D. that wagon builders \nintroduced the pivot for the front wheels useful for making tighter turns. Today \nthe idea is one that would almost immediately suggest itself. The Romans thought \nof it but chose the short wheel base wagons instead, apparently an early example of \nan army favoring mission and maintainability over maneuverability and vulnerabil\xad\nity. (An army of maneuver would have made the opposite choice.) The steam and \nwindmill ideas of Heron mentioned earlier in conjunction with toys, also had no \nfollowup until centuries later. It took a millennium for the helicopter toy to travel \nfrom China to Europe, if it came that way at all.\nThe notion of “progress” itself is relatively new. Most likely in old times before \nthe “bend”, technology responded to immediate needs. People lived by tradition, a \nsolidifying concept. Aside from religion, they had little else to go by. Their vision \nwas limited to the seasons, not technology. Innovation implies a break in the tra\xad\nditional way of doing things. Today progress, being “modern”, is a value in itself \nregardless of the worth of the output. Needs are created in a consumer economy. \nConsistent with the location of this bend is the remark by a 19th century historian \n(Henry Adams), anticipating the oncoming 20th century. “The American boy of \n1854 stood nearer the year 1 than the year 1900.”\nToday, evolving technical innovation is different because it affects social \nhuman factors and the individual’s very biological structure, with a concur\xad\nrent impact on values. (A value attached to an object becomes an attitude.) \n“Technology”, critical as it is, still lacks the status or focus of, for example “the \neconomy”. Often technology is subsumed by it even though technology has a \nseparate existence, and is driving society. The availability is such that priorities \nmust be established in the specific technologies through its social value. The view \nimpacts on helicopters as well as other forms of technical innovation.

The passage suggests that technical complication is not a pure evil, but is a necessary ingredient of technical progress. It is only relatively evil, and is the price to be paid for the gain. The fact that a new device is more complicated should not be enough to deter us from adopting it, as long as it can be shown that the greater complication is not out of proportion to the advantage gained. The passage also notes that larger complication does not necessarily make a device less reliable.

The passage highlights the importance of considering the appropriate level of complication for a particular context, taking into account factors such as the capabilities of the users and the price that they are willing to pay for ease of operation. This is particularly relevant in the context of airships, which are described as a German product developed for German mentality and trends of action.

The passage also mentions the potential benefits of automatic control of airships, which may result in smaller airloads on the structure and in larger security and comfort of travel. This suggests that the use of more complicated devices can lead to improvements in technical performance and user experience."
"Based on the given context information, can you explain the concept of L/D ratio and how it relates to the windmill's axis of rotation and the inclinations of the forces acting on the blades? Also, discuss the potential impact of the Autogiro's peculiar feathering action on the L/D ratio.","The L/D ratio, or lift-to-drag ratio, is a crucial measure of efficiency for the Autogiro's rotor. Unlike traditional aeroplanes, the Autogiro's rotor consists of four blades that can adjust to the airflow and maintain a constant L/D ratio. This design allows for a more efficient use of lift, as the blades can adjust to the airflow and maintain a constant L/D ratio.

The L/D ratio of the Autogiro's rotor is influenced by the inclinations of the forces acting on the blades. In a side wind, the resultant force acting on each blade can be either positive or negative, depending on the angle of incidence of the plane of rotation to the flight path. If the torques on the windmill balance as a whole, the L/D of the whole disk surface will depend on the inclinations to the perpendicular to the flight path of the forces R in the diagrams of Fig. 7.

The peculiar feathering action of the Autogiro may assist in securing a high L/D ratio. This feathering action involves the blades tilting slightly to the side opposite to the direction of the wind. This tilting reduces the drag on the blades and allows for a more efficient use of lift.

In Table XI, wind tunnel tests of La Cierva's Autogiro show a surprisingly high L/D ratio for the whole disk surface. This high L/D ratio is conceivable due to the peculiar feathering action of the Autogiro's rotor.

The Autogiro's unique design and feathering action allow for a more efficient use of lift and a potentially higher L/D ratio than traditional aeroplanes. However, the Autogiro's sensitivity to changes in parameters, such as changes in available horsepower, can result in significant changes in top speed. This sensitiveness to changes in parameters seems to be a fundamental characteristic of the Autogiro.

In conclusion, the Autogiro's rotor design and feathering action allow for a more efficient use of lift and a potentially higher L/D ratio than traditional aeroplanes. However, the Autogiro's sensitivity to changes in parameters, such as changes in available horsepower, can result in significant changes in top speed.","['The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n528\n“Autogiro” No. 4 (Figs. 5 and 6), which took off a few months later, was already \nbeing built.\nThe sustaining wing of this fourth aircraft had four blades, in place of five in \nthe second, and three in the third, but instead of their being rigidly fastened to a \ncommon shaft, they were articulated to it and could move freely up or down while \nrevolving around it (Fig. 7). The articulation point of the blades is situated below \ntheir center of gravity and the resultant of the lift and centrifugal force acting on \neach blade, [sic] must pass through this point. The blade of greater lift will go up \nmore than the opposite one and the resultant of all the reactions will pass through \na fixed point in which the metacentric curve has been concentrated. Therefore, \nthere is no transmission of moments to the axis of rotation, nor are there any gyro\xad\nscopic effects, since there is no continuity in the rotational plane necessary for \nproducing\xa0them.\nWould practice confirm the theory? On January 10, last, Lieut. Gomez Spencer \ngave an affirmative answer. The “Autogiro” did not balance properly and fell like \nthe former ones, not to the right, however, but to the left, that is to say, in the direc\xad\ntion contrary to the one due to the decentralization of pressure. The reason for this \nlack of balance was immediately found. It was the torque of the tractor propeller Photo of autogyro number 4.

It is nearly independent of incidence, speed, etc.\nThe centre of gravity is relatively very low, hence \nthere are always high restoring forces bringing the \nmachine back to its position of equilibrium. At the \nsame time there are high damping forces preventing \nresonance, i.e., oscillations of increasing amplitude \nabout the position of equilibrium, as might be feared \nfrom the low centre of gravity.\nThe damping does not, however, interfere with \nordinary maneuvers.\nGyroscopic forces, which would be of the sever\xad\nest nature in a rigid system, cannot be transmitted \nthrough the flexible attachment of blades to axis.\nFinally the articulated blades form a flexible system in sudden gusts. The inertia \nforces are ten times the lift forces, the resultant being √(102 + 12)  = 10 very nearly. \nIn a gust producing ten times the air forces the resultant would be √(102 + 102) = \n14.1 approx., an increase of only 41 per cent. \n[sic] over normal stresses.\nIn the first machine of this type, lateral \ncontrol, though unnecessary in theory and it \nwould seem in practice, was provided for by \ntilting the axis of the windmill to the right \nor left; but it became immediately evident in \nthe very first tests that the pilot’s strength was \ninsufficient to work the control.\nAfter many months of exploration, \n“crashes,” and rebuilding (this particular \nmachine was reconstructed or modified fifteen Photo of the autogyroPhoto of the autogyro\nFIG. 13.\nFIG. 14.Photo of an autoyro, the details of which are very unclear.\nFIG. 12A.', '559\nDocument 5-36 (a–b)\ndetrimental to the efficiency within certain limits, it is evident that for this and \nother considerations, the coning angle must be kept below a certain value. On the \nother hand, it is always possible to re-establish the ratio by increasing the relative \nweight of each blade, but this must also have a practical limit. I have arbitrarily \nfixed the maximum coning angle as nine degrees thirty minutes, a condition in \nwhich certain autogiros have already flown without any apparent loss of efficiency \nor difficulty whatever, and the maximum desirable ratio of total weight to weight \nof the rotor is ten. Considering those conditions and the others already mentioned \nabout the tip speed to top speed ratio and suitable loading per square foot of disc \narea in order to keep the existing landing qualities, it is possible to write a system \nof inequations which show the very curious fact that the total maximum weight \nof autogiros complying with all of them increases very quickly with the top speed \nassumed for the same. A correctly calculated autogiro, with a top speed of only \neighty miles per hour, should not exceed one thousand pounds all up weight, while \nfor one hundred miles per hour the weight could be more than two thousand five \nhundred, and a machine weighing ten thousand pounds should be faster than one \nhundred and forty miles per hour.\nThis is only, of course, a tentative estimation, but gives, I believe, a fairly con\xad\nservative idea of the possibilities. As the big machines should be proportionally \nfaster than the small for equal power loading, because of the smaller relative para\xad\nsite, which is also more favourable to the autogiro than to the aeroplane, since \nit is equivalent to an increase in the available power, and since the utility of big \ntransport machines, for instance, is only real if they are fast, I can see no funda\xad\nmental objections to three, four or five-ton autogiros. For bigger sizes I think it is \npremature to forecast anything and, in any case, I believe more for the present in \nsmall and medium size autogiros than in very big ones, which would only come in \nthe course of time.\nOne of the more interesting possibilities of the autogiro is the slow vertical \ndescent, being the first flying machine ever realised substantially capable of such \na feat. The parachutal efficiency of the autogiro is one of the most interesting and \napparently mysterious aerodynamical phenomena and also one of the most dis\xad\ncussed. Certain theorists cannot see any physical possibility of the thrust on any \nkind of parachute being greater than that corresponding to the dynamic pressure, \nwhich is equivalent to assuming that the parachute stops completely all the air \ncoming directly against its surface (in the relative motion) and this leads to the \nconclusion that the ordinary parachute is about the optimum. A number of experi\xad\nments with models, both in wind channels and in free drop, seem approximately to \nconfirm this idea. On the contrary, other experiments such as those carried out by \nCostanzi and Munk gave results about twice as good in some cases.\nFull-scale measures on actual autogiros in real vertical descent are difficult \nsince, by construction, the centre of gravity of the machine is placed in front of \nthe axis of the rotor, so that a purely vertical descent can only be obtained during a', 'The Wind and Beyond, Volume III\n556\nproportions, has a maximum efficiency in its middle range of speed, while the \nautogiro is at its best at both ends.\nIt is perfectly possible for an autogiro to be faster than an equivalent aeroplane, \nthough its optimum lift-on-drag ratio would be inferior. Fig. 3 shows the relative \nshapes of the required horse-power curves in function of the speed for two normal \nequivalent machines, one aeroplane and the other autogiro. It will be only a ques\xad\ntion of the available horse-power whether the autogiro will be faster or not.\nIt can be shown that if the diameter of the autogiro equals the span of the \naeroplane, and both machines have the same parasite drag, the induced and parasite \npower would be the same in either case, and the required horse-power equations \nwould differ only in the term corresponding to profile drag. In the aeroplane these \nterms will be practically proportional to the cube of the speed, while in the autogiro \nit would only be directly proportional to the speed within wide limits. This proves \nthat the greater the speed the less the difference between both and eventually the \nautogiro must become faster.\nThe same Fig. 3 explains qualitatively why the aeroplane, in general, will have \nbetter rate of climb, since it corresponds to the range of speed for which its effi\xad\nciency is a maximum, and why, on the contrary, the steepness of the climb of the \nautogiro can be much better than that of the aeroplane, provided only the propel\xad\nler’s efficiency does not drop to too low a figure at very slow speeds, which seems \nto show that geared propellers are proportionally of greater interest to the autogiro \nthan to the\xa0aeroplane.\nThe shape of the required \nhorse-power curves of Fig. 3 shows \nalso the much greater changes in \nthe top speed of the autogiro with \nthe available horse-power than \nthose corresponding to the equiva\xad\nlent aeroplane. I have had recently \nthe opportunity of checking this \nconclusion in the most amazing \nmanner, obtaining from the same \nmachine within the same twenty-\nfour hours a top speed increased by \nnearly thirty miles per hour by sim\xad\nply changing the propeller.\nThis sensitiveness to changes in parameters seems to be a fundamental charac\xad\nteristic of the autogiro. The third term in the equation of required horse-power, of \nwhich I have made mention before, is, for the aeroplane, proportional to the surface \nof its wings, the density, a coefficient which only changes slowly with the speed and \nthe cube of the speed, while for the autogiro it is independent of the surface and \nthe density and is directly proportional to a coefficient which changes slowly with Graph labled Figure 3 with Speed on the x-axis and horsepower on the y-axis. Available horsepower increases with speed. The amount of required horespower for an autogiro is less than that for an airplane at low and high speeds.\nFIG. 3.']","
The L/D ratio, or lift-to-drag ratio, is a measure of a wing or airfoil's efficiency in generating lift while minimizing drag. In the context of a windmill, the L/D ratio is used to describe the efficiency of the windmill as a lifting surface. The L/D ratio depends on the inclinations of the forces (R) acting on the blades to the perpendicular of the flight path.

If the axis of rotation of the windmill is only slightly inclined to the flight path, and the inclinations of R to the perpendicular to the flight path are alternately positive and negative, it is possible for the windmill to have a very high L/D ratio for the whole disk surface. This is because the positive and negative torques on the windmill balance out, resulting in a net torque of zero. The high L/D ratio could potentially be higher than that of a single blade element.

The peculiar feathering action of the Autogiro may assist in securing this high L/D ratio. Feathering refers to the adjustment of the pitch of the blades to control the lift and drag generated by the rotor. By adjusting the pitch of the blades, the Autogiro can maintain a high L/D ratio even in side winds, which can be particularly challenging for conventional windmills.

Therefore, it would be dangerous to dismiss the surprising results obtained by La Cierva in the wind tunnel as entirely impossible, as they demonstrate the potential for windmills to achieve high L/D ratios under certain conditions."
What were the primary changes made to the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the Discovery Program and why were they made?,"The primary changes made to the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the Discovery Program were aimed at addressing specific issues and aligning with NASA policies and requirements. These changes included:

1. The exclusion of launch costs from the cap on the PI-Managed Mission Cost, which provided more flexibility in selecting launch vehicles and allowed for the inclusion of more capable launch vehicles.

2. The requirement that returned space-exposed hardware be curated and that the costs for such curation be included in the PI-Managed Mission Cost, which ensured that returned space-exposed hardware is properly preserved and provided a mechanism for cost recovery.

3. The addition of a Project Manager Alternate, which provided more flexibility in selecting a project manager and allowed for the possibility of a backup project manager.

4. The change in reserve level assessment, which provided a more accurate assessment of the reserve level.

5. The allowance of investigations enabled by the use of Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRGs) and new propulsion technology, which provided more options for mission design and allowed for the infusion of new technology into Discovery missions.

In addition to these changes, the Discovery Program goals were revised and updated to more accurately reflect the current goals and desired outcomes of the program. The program now aims to provide frequent flight opportunities for high-quality, high-value scientific investigations that can be accomplished under a not to exceed cost cap, with outcomes that include advancement in scientific knowledge, addition of scientific data, and expansion of the pool of well-qualified Principal Investigators and Project Managers.

All requirements in the new NPR 7120.5C were made requirements for Discovery mission proposals and plans, including the use of Earned Value Management and Cost Analysis Data Requirement reporting. Draft Level 1 requirements were requested in an attempt to set them early and have them truly drive the missions as envisioned, rather than layered on top of the mission as late as the Preliminary Design Review.

The program's education and public outreach commitment was drastically reduced to 0.25–0.50 percent of the NASA Science Mission Directorate cost, excluding launch vehicles.","['Chapter 8: Lessons Learned from the Evolution of the Program\n309\nImplementing Change: The 2004 AO\nFinally, on 16 April, NASA Headquarters released the 2004 Announcement of \nOpportunity, almost four years after the previous one. The 25 percent reserve require\xad\nment was added, and the cost cap increased to $360 million (Fiscal Year 2004 dollars)—\nthe maximum available within the “futures” line in the Discovery Program budget.\nThe AO had been rewritten substantially since 2000, with greater attention to \nincorporating lessons learned over the past five years to avoid recurrences of the \nproblems incurred during implementation of previous missions. New requirements \nhad been added—such as the staffing requirement of a deputy project manager—and \nadditional financial reserves were now mandated. Investigations were now required to \npublish their data and analysis in peer-reviewed scientific literature—a change since \nthe Stardust days, as management realized that the mission was not obligated to deliver \nNASA-funded mission science. Moreover, each mission was required to deliver data \nto the Planetary Data System. After some discussion, missions were again required to \npropose a full set of education and public outreach activities at 1 percent to 2 percent \nof NASA cost. To combat the bait-and-switch tactics that some perceived in the 1998 \ncompetition, and the frequent personnel changes in Deep Impact leadership, the AO \nrequired that the project manager be named at proposal, and his or her qualifications \nwould be evaluated as part of the Technical-Management-Cost evaluation. Missions \nwere to launch by 31 December 2009. \nThe Discovery Program held an AO Preproposal Conference in Washington, DC, \non 23\xa0April 2004, to provide a direct interface to the community, as well as AO clari\xad\nfication to assure high-quality proposals. Andy Dantzler, the Division Director of the \nPlanetary Science Division, and Susan Niebur, the Discovery Program Scientist, had \na message to send. Both Niebur’s first and last slides emphasized the importance of \nproperly scoping mission investigations and accounting for adequate reserve: “Mission \ninvestigations must be appropriately scoped. Mission proposals must include adequate \nreserve. Remember the value to the taxpayers.”23\nThe new parameters were introduced, explained, and emphasized, as Niebur and \nDantzler also emphasized the importance of scoping investigations to fit within the \ncost cap, proposing only the science that could be done for the available dollars. The \n25\xa0percent reserve requirement was announced, justified, and clarified: All projects \nmust show at least a 25 percent reserve at proposal, through the end of Phase A (selec\xad\ntion) and Phase B (confirmation). \nThe AO included new opportunities to involve other scientists, such as the Guest \nObserver program made popular by Kepler and astrophysical missions; the opportu\xad\nnity to propose Participating Scientist Programs at proposal that could be chosen for \n23 \t\nNiebur, S.

These additional components could thus \nbe ignored, and the investigators could determine whether the observed neon was \nconsistent with a single source: the quiescent solar wind. 181\nUnlike the aluminum foil, when the bulk metallic glass was cleaned (etching in \nvacuo), the material allowed researchers to create high-resolution depth profiling of \nthe implanted noble gases. Researchers were ultimately able to eliminate the need for \nan additional flux of high-energy solar particles that had long been theorized for the \nlunar foils.182\nThe Care and Feeding of a Discovery AO\nIn 1998, the Discovery Program held a “lessons learned” workshop—something it \nhad done consistently so as to keep the program “of the community.” Attendees were \ncandid in their responses. Ultimately, NASA Headquarters accepted several recom\xad\nmendations to emerge from the community: First, the Discovery Program would \nincrease the number of proposal reviewers. It would also constrain the proposal sum\xad\nmary issued with the post–Step 1 press release, to protect proprietary information. \nThe program would shorten the evaluation process. Moreover, NASA would establish \na steering committee to investigate the possibility of funding future mission studies \nand to provide recommendations for implementation.\nOn 31 March 1998, NASA’s Office of Space Science Applications released the 1998 \nDiscovery Announcement of Opportunity. This AO was the first with Technical, \nManagement, Cost, and Outreach (TMCO, later called TMC) to be run by the pro\xad\ngram support office at NASA’s Langley Research Center. This process would remain in \neffect for the next decade. Wayne Ritchie was the first Discovery Acquisition Manager \nat Langley; Brad Perry succeeded him in this role and was then named director of the \nScience Support Office (later called the Science Office for Mission Assessments). Gloria \nHernandez, and later, Carlos Liceaga, filled the acquisition manager role for Discovery.\nThe process by which the AO had been drafted was by then well established, hav\xad\ning been hashed out previously over several AO cycles led by the Discovery Program \nOffice at NASA Headquarters and implemented by the Lunar and Planetary Institute \nin Houston. The Langley office further formalized the process, crystallizing it into \nstandard operating procedures. When an AO was to be released, the program scien\xad\ntist at NASA Headquarters took the previous AO and made modifications in accor\xad\ndance with policy changes prompted by reviews, management, and lessons learned. \n181 \t\nWimmer-Schweingruber, R.

The primary changes made to the AO for the Discovery Program were the insertion of Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRGs), the addition of two additional questions to ease the assignment of proposals to TMC experts in radioactive power sources, and the request for additional technical trajectory information including solar electric propulsion-specific assumptions, models, and operations concept to be included. These changes were made to expand the program to include more complex missions and missions to planets beyond the asteroid belt, and to better understand the cost growth of missions since Genesis. The due date for proposals was also delayed a week to accommodate the late request for additional technical trajectory information."

"""What is the role of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sun Monitoring on the External Payload of Columbus (Solar) facility in improving climate models on Earth?""","The European Space Agency (ESA) Sun Monitoring on the External Payload of Columbus (Solar) facility measured the spectrum of solar radiation over a period of 9 years, ending in 2017, far extending its original planned lifespan of 18 months to 2 years. These measurements generated a wealth of data during the approximately 11-year solar cycle—i.e., a regular period of increasing and decreasing solar activity. These data help scientists better understand and deal with all aspects influenced by solar radiation. The Solar facility data contribute to the understanding of solar and stellar physics and Earth System sciences such as atmospheric chemistry and climatology.

The most significant was a decision to \ninitiate a space situational awareness program in 2009. As ESA chose to \ndefine it, “space situational awareness” included space weather, surveillance \nand tracking of artificial satellites, and detection of near-Earth objects.44 In \nthe United States, different agencies were responsible for these functions: the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shared responsibility for \nspace weather forecasting with the Air Force; the Air Force handled space \nsurveillance; and NASA was responsible for near-Earth objects, though with \nsome dependence on Air Force assets and technology development, as we have \nseen. Without the motivation provided by the United States’ world-spanning \nmilitary obligations, European nations had not invested in the capability to \nmonitor space traffic, perhaps because it seemed largely a military activity.

In the late 1970s, NASA had \nproposed a joint venture with the European Space Agency (ESA) called the \nInternational Solar Polar Mission (ISPM). ESA, formed in 1975 to represent \n10 founding Western European nations in space-related activities, became \nthe primary operating organization for the European space science commu\xad\nnity. The member countries of ESA have always funded the organization at \nfar lower levels than NASA’s budget, but ESA has steadily increased its capa\xad\nbilities while cultivating a program of world-class science and technological \ndevelopment. Both the U.S. and European space science communities recog\xad\nnize the potential benefits of international collaboration from a financial and \nintellectual standpoint and so have often pursued cooperative endeavors.\nThe proposed ISPM mission consisted of two spacecraft in polar orbits \naround the Sun, nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. NASA and \nESA were to build one orbiter apiece and launch both by Space Shuttle in \n1983, then use a gravity-assist maneuver to place the spacecraft into their \ncorrect\xa0orbits.\nIn 1982, due to budget restrictions imposed by the Reagan administration \nand rising costs of Shuttle development, NASA canceled its ISPM spacecraft. \nThe two space organizations reworked their agreement so that ESA would \nprovide a single spacecraft for a new solar mission, NASA would provide \na launch vehicle, and both organizations would contribute instruments. \nThis arrangement would allow scientists on both sides of the Atlantic access \nto any data returned by the spacecraft. Although the new mission, named \nUlysses, eventually flew, ESA took umbrage at NASA’s unilateral decision to \ncancel the initial agreement without consultation and adjusted its strategy \nfor future partnerships with NASA.62 This incident would play a significant \nrole in a later joint venture between the two space agencies, the Cassini-\nHuygens mission to Saturn.\nIn a 1983 report, Planetary Exploration Through the Year 2000, the NASA \nAdvisory Council’s Solar System Exploration Committee supported a joint \nmission with ESA to send an orbiter to Saturn along with a probe to land \non one of Saturn’s moons, Titan.63 The mission remained in the concept \n62.\t John Krige, “NASA as an Instrument of U.S. Foreign Policy,” in Societal Impact of \nSpaceflight, ed.

NASA contributed \nthree instruments on SOHO as well as launch and \nflight operations support.

The spacecraft returned its first image \non 19 December 1995 and was fully commissioned \nfor operations by 16 April 1996. SOHO finished its \nplanned two-year study of the Sun’s atmosphere, \nsurface, and interior in April 1998. Communica\xad\ntions with the spacecraft were interrupted for four \nmonths beginning 24 June 1998, after which the \nspacecraft was apparently spinning, losing electri\xad\ncal power, and not pointing at the Sun. After inten\xad\nsive search efforts, by 25 September, controllers \nmanaged to regain control and return SOHO to \n“normal mode.” Because of the failure of onboard \ngyros, ESA developed a special gyroless method of \norientation (which used reaction wheels) that was \nsuccessfully implemented beginning 1 February \n1999.

How does the European Space Agency (ESA) Sun Monitoring on the External Payload of Columbus (Solar) facility contribute to the improvement of climate models on Earth?,"In addition to the ESA Sun Monitoring facility on the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS), the WORF (Wide Field and Stereo Observatory for Roving Furnace) hosts the Meteor instrument, which is obtaining the first space-based observations of the chemical composition of meteors entering Earth’s atmosphere. These data will improve our understanding of the processes that formed our solar system. The Crew Earth Observations (CEO) Facility includes Earth imagery taken by crew members using handheld digital cameras, which supports disaster response, scientific investigations, and commercial endeavors under the auspices of the ISS National Laboratory. The High-Definition Earth Viewing (HDEV) camera mission includes four different commercial, high-definition cameras on the Columbus External Facility, which is assessing camera quality while taking Earth imagery and the hardware’s ability to survive and function in the extreme thermal and radioactive environment of low-Earth orbit. The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE)-III mission investigates the vertical distribution of ozone, trace gases, and aerosols in Earth’s stratosphere and troposphere, which will improve our understanding of ozone generation and destruction processes in the upper atmosphere and how climate change is impacting those processes. The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) mission obtains global measurements of the amount, rate, and radiant energy of lightning from orbit, which provides a link between geophysical processes and thunderstorms, thereby improving knowledge of how these interactions affect weather, climate, lightning physics, and atmospheric chemistry. The Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS)-1 mission collects data on the sun’s energy output, which increases our understanding of how much energy input the sun provides to the Earth geophysical system and how the atmosphere responds to changes in solar output. The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission thermal infrared sensor collects data on plant evapotranspiration processes, which will allow us to monitor how regional plant stress is changing due to global climate change.","['187\nImproving Climate Models on Earth \nClimate models are essential in forecasting global \nchanges in Earth’s climate and weather, and in \ndetermining the role humanity plays in these changes. \nThese models require input parameters.

The nucleus was also found to be under-dense, porous, and mostly dust, rather than ices, with a dust-to-gas ratio greater than 1. The pre-flight model had expected a solid, spherical nucleus, 6 kilometers in diameter, having a bulk density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter and with a ratio of dust production to gas production of 0.5. These findings challenged the prevailing understanding of comets as relatively predictable members of the cosmos, as they suggested that comets were not necessarily composed of ices and that their behavior was not fully understood. This discovery also highlighted the limitations of uniformitarianism, which assumed that the same natural laws and processes operating today have always operated throughout Earth history, at the same rate and across the entire planet. The unexpected characteristics of Comet Halley's nucleus challenged this assumption and underscored the need for continued research and exploration of these enigmatic celestial objects.","['A History of Near-Earth Objects Research\n76\nresults. Prior to the Halley missions, a widely held view of its nucleus consid\xad\nered that it would be solid, nearly spherical, with a diameter of 4–5 kilome\xad\nters, a bulk density of 1.0–1.7 g/cm3, and a fairly bright albedo of 26\xa0percent. \nIt was expected to be outgassing over its entire sunward surface with a gas-\nto-dust mass ratio of one or more.67 None of these predictions turned out to \nbe\xa0correct.\nExpecting a relatively bright, icy nucleus, engineers had designed the \nGiotto camera system to follow the brightest region in its field of view. That \nturned out to be a gas and dust jet near one end of the dark nucleus, and \nthe nucleus itself was both darker and larger than expected, with an albedo \nof only 4 percent and triaxial dimensions of 7.2, 7.2, and 15.3 kilometers. \nAfter extensive image processing, the Giotto images revealed more than a \ndozen narrow jets, some of which were surprisingly well collimated.

It was estimated that Comet Halley loses about 0.5 percent of its \nmass at each return to perihelion.69 The mass of Comet Halley’s nucleus was \nestimated from its orbital acceleration due to outgassing rocket-like effects, \nand dividing this mass by its estimated volume (computed from the observed \ndimensions) provided a nucleus bulk density of only 0.28 grams per cubic \n67.\t M.

It \nwas named after famed Italian Renaissance painter \nGiotto di Bondone (c. 1267–1337) who had \ndepicted Halley’s Comet as the Star of Bethlehem \nin his painting Adoration of the Magi. Because the \ncylindrical spacecraft was designed to approach \ncloser to Halley than any other probe, it was \nequipped with two dust shields separated by 23 \ncentimeters, the first to bear the shock of impact \nand spread the impact energy over larger areas of the \nsecond thicker rear sheet. The design of the space\xad\ncraft was based on the spin-stabilized magneto\xad\nspheric Geos satellites launched in 1977 and 1978. \nAfter launch, and further course corrections on 26 \nAugust 1985, 12 February 1986, and 12 March \n1986, Giotto was put on a 500-kilometer-range \nflyby trajectory to the comet’s core. Ballistics data \non its precise voyage was based upon tracking \ninformation from the Soviet Vega 1 and 2 probes. \nThe Giotto spacecraft eventually passed by Halley \non 14 March 1986. Closest encounter was at a \ndistance of 596 kilometers at 00:03:02 UT, the \nspacecraft being the only one among the large \narmada of spacecraft sent to investigate Halley that \nactually entered the ionosphere of the comet. At \na range of 137.6 million kilometers from Earth, \njust 2 seconds before closest approach, telemetry \nstopped due to impact with a heavy concentration \nof dust that probably knocked the spacecraft’s high \ngain antenna out of alignment with Earth. Fortu\xad\nnately, data transmission was restored within 21.75 \nseconds (with proper orientation of the antenna \nrestored after 32 minutes). On average, Giotto had \nbeen hit 100 times a second by particles weighing \nup to 0.001 grams. By the end of its encounter with \nHalley, the spacecraft was covered in at least 26 \nkilograms of dust stemming from 12,000 impacts. \nGiotto returned 2,000 images of Halley. After the \nencounter, ESA decided to redirect the vehicle for \na flyby of Earth. The spacecraft was officially put \nin hibernation mode on 2 April 1986. Course cor\xad\nrections on 10, 20, and 21 March 1986, however, \nset it on a 22,000-kilometer flyby of Earth on 2 July \n1990 for a gravity assist (the first time that Earth \nhad been used for such a purpose) to visit a new \ntarget: Comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup, which Giotto \nflew by at 15:30 UT on 10 July 1992 at range of \napproximately 200 kilometers. Eight experiments \nprovided extensive data on a wide variety of com\xad\netary phenomena during this closest ever flyby of \na comet. After formal conclusion of the encoun\xad\nter, Giotto was put in hibernation on 23 July 1992. \nLater, in September 1999, ESA scientists revealed \nthat a second comet or cometary fragment may \nhave been accompanying Grigg-Skjellerup during \nthe encounter in 1992. The spacecraft repeated a \nflyby of Earth at 02:40 UT on 1 July 1999 at range \nof 219,000 kilometers but was not reactivated.\n170\nSuisei\nNation: Japan (2)\nObjective(s): Halley’s Comet flyby\nSpacecraft: Planet-A\nSpacecraft Mass: 139.5 kg\nMission Design and Management: ISAS\nLaunch Vehicle: Mu-3S-II (no.', 'Chapter 3: Finding and Characterizing Near-Earth Objects Through 1990\n77\ncentimeter.70 This low density implied a very porous nucleus rather than a \nsolid monolith. The dust-to-gas ratio was expected to be about 0.5 but turned \nout to be greater than 1, suggesting that the nucleus was mostly dust, rather \nthan ices. Whipple’s icy conglomerate model—affectionately termed a “dirty \nsnowball” model prior to the Halley armada—was apparently more like an \n“icy dirtball.” The nucleus of Comet Halley was dark, under-dense, and \nporous, with icy active areas on (or just below) the surface that generated gas \nand dust jets. Once initiated, the nucleus outgassing activity and mass loss \nthen continuously altered the nucleus surface features, erasing any impact \ncraters. These basic comet nucleus characteristics would be upheld by several \nsubsequent comet missions.71\nNot many near-Earth objects had been identified by 1990, and while vis\xad\nits to comets had somewhat illuminated their nature, near-Earth asteroids \nremained relative mysteries. The decades of radar, light curve, and spectral \nresearch had raised many questions, but quite a few remained unanswered. \nChemical composition would remain a mystery until sample-return missions \nin the 2000s began to shed some light on the subject.\nBy the time that happened, the science/policy landscape had dramatically \nshifted, in part driven by a set of arguments advanced in the 1980s and largely \naccepted by the early 1990s, that cosmic impacts could not only leave marks \non Earth’s surface like Meteor Crater but could affect the course of evolution. \nTruly enormous impacts might even transport life between the major planets. \nThe following chapter will discuss this transformation in understanding.\n70.\t H.

It became the International Comet Explorer (ICE), and, after \nsome celestial gymnastics, it was maneuvered to make passage through the \ntail of periodic Comet Giacobini-Zinner in September 1985. The ICE space\xad\ncraft did not carry a camera, but its particles and fields instruments were \ndesigned to monitor the solar wind of charged particles that would collide \nwith Earth’s ionosphere. These same instruments detected the Sun’s magnetic \nfield lines wrapped around the comet’s ion atmosphere.65\nIn March 1986, the international armada of five spacecraft flew rapidly \npast Comet Halley, reaching distances as close as 596 kilometers to more \nthan 7 million kilometers. The Halley Armada enabled the first view of an \nactive comet nucleus. When a comet enters the inner solar system, it becomes \nactive, and the resulting dust and gas effectively hide the nucleus from view \nby ground-based sensors. Thus, the science results from the Halley spacecraft \nflybys included the first close-up of a cometary nucleus. \nIn the first half of the 20th century, an accepted model for the cometary \nnucleus envisioned a bound or unbound collection of separate particles flying \nin formation about the Sun. The English astronomer Raymond Lyttleton, \nin the mid-20th century, maintained that comets were flying clouds of dust \ncaptured from interstellar dust clouds. At about the same time, the Soviet \nastronomer Sergey Vsekhsvyatskij argued that comets formed from volcanic \neruptions from the outer planets or their satellites. However, most of the scien\xad\ntific community accepted the solid, icy conglomerate model for the cometary \nnucleus put forward by Fred Whipple in 1950.66\nWhipple’s comet model was extremely influential since it could explain \nthe large cometary gas production rates, the jetlike structures in coma, erratic \nactivity, and especially the so-called nongravitational motions of comets that \nwere thought to be due to the rocket-like thrusting of the outgassing nucleus. \nHowever, Whipple’s model was not actually confirmed until the Giotto imag\xad\ning results and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union’s Vega mission imaging \n65.\t Wing-Huen Ip, “Global Solar Wind Interaction and Ionospheric Dynamics,” in \nComets II, ed.

The 1618 comet was the first to be observed with a telescope, \nand astronomers began to understand them as physical objects, rather than \nas omens sent by deities. But comets were also not quite fully accepted as \npermanent features of the cosmos. Johannes Kepler, who in this era demon\xad\nstrated that planetary orbits were calculable as ellipses, believed comets were \nephemeral and moved in straight lines. Other period astronomers believed \nthem eternal, moving in orbits, though not necessarily centered on the Sun.\nEdmond Halley’s 1705 treatise on comets began to solidify elite opinion \naround the idea that at least some comets were repeat visitors. Using a tech\xad\nnique developed by Isaac Newton, he computed orbits for 24 comets that \nhad appeared between 1337 and 1698, and he contended that a single comet \nactually accounted for three of those visits. It had appeared in 1531, 1607, and \n1682. He also predicted its return in late 1758 or early 1759.7 Though Halley \ndid not live to see his comet’s next reappearance, it did return. A German \namateur made the first recorded observation on Christmas evening, 1758.8 \nHalley’s Comet, as we now name it, settled the question about cometary lon\xad\ngevity and rendered these objects relatively predictable members of the cos\xad\nmos. If one could track a comet for the few days or weeks of an apparition, one \ncould generate its orbital characteristics and predict its future motion.\nHalley also had the foresight to wonder what would happen should a comet \nstrike Earth. But he did not strongly pursue the question—perhaps wisely, for \nthe sake of his reputation. The same century in which Halley’s comet predic\xad\ntion was made and confirmed also witnessed the development of the doctrine \nof uniformitarianism within the natural sciences.

What are the main parts of the flapper valves used in the propellant tanks of the X-34 main propulsion system and what are they made of?,"The main parts of the flapper valves used in the propellant tanks of the X-34 main propulsion system are made of aluminum and are anodized to prevent corrosion. These flapper valves are based on the same concepts as the LRACS series of valves, which were developed for the leading edge active cooling system (LEACS) and the International Space Station temperature and humidity control system. The surface finish and seats of the 11070-1 and 11120 valves were modified due to significant leakage around the seats, which was caused by the lapping compound used to polish the seats. The new lapping techniques and the use of new compounds to generate better surface finishes and tighter seating led to the development of new flapper valves.

The X-34 main propulsion system uses a total of 18 valves, including two main propellant valves (MOV and MFV) controlled by separate solenoid pilot valves, four electro-pneumatic valves (GGOV, GGFV, MFPV, and OBV) with built-in solenoid pilot valves, and seven check valves. The engine operates at one rated power level, nominally 60,000 lbf at vacuum for the 15:1 area ratio nozzle configuration, and slightly higher for the 30:1 nozzle. Thrust and mixture ratio are open loop controlled by setting fixed orifices in the engine propellant lines during engine calibration testing. Electrical commands for engine start and shutdown are issued by an electronic controller external to the engine. The MC-1 uses two ignition systems for engine start, one for the main chamber and one for the gas generator. Following spin-up of the turbopump from the vehicle, main chamber ignition is accomplished by injecting TEA/TEB hypergol from the piston-actuated reloadable cartridge into the combustion chamber.","['The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n341\non alternate runways in the event of engine shutdown.

Compartmentalization of the fuel tanks would enable the vehicle to \nmaintain center of gravity during a robust abort scenario. The propellant tank \ndesign characteristics are summarized in Table\xa01.36\nTable 1: Propellant Tank Design Characteristics\nCharacteristics\nLOX Tanks\nRP-1 Tank\nForward\nAft\nDiameter (feet)\n4.50\n4.50\n5.17\nLength (feet)\n9.16\n12.81\n10.25\nNumber of compartments\n3\n4\n3\nVolume at 70° F (cubic feet)\n123.6\n180.9\n190.5\nStorage load (cubic feet)\n8,542\n12,502\n9,398\nMaximum operating pressure (psia)\n75\n75\n100\nAlso, the propellant tanks had to minimize sloshing and yet still enable \npropellant delivery to the engine and allow for tank pressurization. This, along \nwith the fact that the tanks were compartmentalized, led to the use of check \nvalves that allowed propellant to flow aft and the ullage (the space within \nthe fuel tank above the top of the liquid propellant) gas to flow forward.37 \nTwo types of check valves were provided to Orbital by ValveTech, Inc., of \nPhelps, New York. Both types (11070-1 and 11120-1) were flapper check \nvalves that rely on torsional springs for preload. The main parts of flappers \nwere aluminum and were anodized to prevent corrosion. The flapper valve \ndesigns evolved from the ones used previously for the leading edge active \ncooling system (LEACS) and the International Space Station temperature \nand humidity control system. The 11070-1 valve was nearly identical to the \n11070-1 used on LEACS, with the only difference being the surface finish \nand seats. The 11120 valve was a new design based on the same concepts as \nthe LRACS series of valve. The surface finish and seats of the 11070 needed \nto be modified as the 11070-1, because initial testing showed significant leak\xad\nage around the seats, where the lapping compound used to polish the seats \nhad created small flow passages. This led to the development of new lapping \ntechniques and the use of new compounds to generate better surface finishes \nand tighter seating.38', 'The Fastrac/MC-1 Engine and X-34 Main Propulsion System\n339\nThe Closeout Report noted that the status of the drive electronics assembly \n[DEA] at termination was as follows: “Since the DEA was no longer required \nto be a flight design, the design was not changed to fix the problems found. \nThe fix would have been a completed new design, which would have added \nsignificant cost and schedule slips. Therefore, the design was complete and the \nsystem had been operating for the duration of the entire test program. There \nwere no DEA failures during the course of the engine testing.”28 \nInstrumentation. The MC-1 engine instrumentation included 16 pressure \ntransducers, 1 thermocouple, and 8 resistance devices. The transducers “provide \nstatic pressure measurements of 6 turbopump pressures, 2 thrust chamber \npressures, 2 gas generator pressures, and 6 purge pressures.” The thermocouple \nmeasured the gas generator turbine temperature and the 8 resistance tempera\xad\nture devices provided surface temperature measurements of a variety of engine \nparameters. The pressure transducers were manufactured by Taber, Stellar, and \nGP:50. The thermocouples were provided by RdF and ARI and the resistance \ntemperature devices were manufactured by RdF.29\nThe X-34 Main Propulsion System \nComponents and Subsystems\nThe main propulsion system (MPS) design had to support all phases of the X-34 \nvehicle operation, including pre-flight, captive carry, powered flight, unpowered \nreturn, safe abort, landing, and subsequent rapid turnaround operations.\nZonal Propulsion Organization\nThe propulsion system components of the X-34 were arranged in five zones \nthroughout the vehicle. The first zone in the forward area of the X-34 contained \nthe nitrogen and helium tanks that were used to pressurize the propellant tanks, \nactivate the pneumatic components, purge engine components, and supply \nthe reaction control system (RCS) thrusters with propellant. These tanks could \nstore over 40 cubic feet of nitrogen and helium gas. The hardware for the RP-1 \n(kerosene) vent was also contained in zone one. The second, third, and fourth \nzones contained the propellant tanks. The forward propellant tank contained \nthe RP-1 and the other two tanks contained the liquid oxygen (LOX). These \nthree zones also contained the hardware to support LOX vent and tank pres\xad\nsurization and RP-1 feed and dump system. The fifth zone was designed to \nhouse the engine and a majority of the feed lines.30\nNASA Marshall supported the X-34 in three ways—program management, \nproviding the Fastrac engine (as Government furnished equipment), and ini\xad\ntial design of the MPS.

Therefore, variations in engine propellant inlet \nconditions cause engine performance variations. Electrical com\xad\nmands for engine start and shutdown are issued by an electronic \ncontroller external to the engine. \nThe MC-1 uses two ignition systems for engine start, one \nfor the main chamber and one for the GG [gas generator]. \nFollowing spin-up of the turbopump from the vehicle…helium \nspin-start system, main chamber ignition is accomplished by \ninjecting TEA/TEB [triethylaluminum/triethylborane] hyper\xad\ngol from the piston-actuated reloadable cartridge” into the \ncombustion\xa0chamber.25']","
The main parts of the flapper valves used in the propellant tanks of the X-34 main propulsion system are made of aluminum and are anodized to prevent corrosion. The flapper valve designs evolved from the ones used previously for the leading edge active cooling system (LEACS) and the International Space Station temperature and humidity control system. The 11070-1 valve was nearly identical to the 11070-1 used on LEACS, with the only difference being the surface finish and seats. The 11120 valve was a new design based on the same concepts as the LRACS series of valve. The surface finish and seats of the 11070 needed to be modified as the 11070-1, because initial testing showed significant leak-age around the seats, where the lapping compound used to polish the seats had created small flow passages. This led to the development of new lapping techniques and the use of new compounds to generate better surface finishes and tighter seating."
Question: What was the primary mission of Lunar Orbiter I and what was the result of its photography mission?,"The primary mission of Lunar Orbiter I was to photograph nine potential Apollo landing sites, seven secondary areas, and the Surveyor I landing site. By 28 August, Lunar Orbiter I had completed its main photography mission, having exposed a total of 205 frames, of which 38 were taken in the initial orbit and 167 in lower orbits, covering an area of 5.18 million km2. As planned, it photographed all 9 potential Apollo landing sites as well as 11 sites on the far side of the Moon. Some of the high-resolution photos were blurred due to smearing (stemming from problems in the imaging system), but the medium resolution images were the best lunar surface images returned to date. One of the images returned, unplanned but taken on 23 August, was the first picture of Earth taken from the vicinity of the Moon.

The Lunar Orbiter program originated as a response to the need to obtain one-meter resolution photographs of potential Apollo landing sites. NASA planned launches of a series of three-axis stabilized spacecraft with four solar panels and a main engine (derived from an Apollo attitude control thruster) for lunar orbit insertion. The primary instrument on board was a 68-kilogram imaging system, which was used to photograph nine potential Apollo landing sites, seven secondary areas, and the Surveyor I landing site. By 28 August, Lunar Orbiter I had completed its main photography mission, having exposed a total of 205 frames, of which 38 were taken in the initial orbit and 167 in lower orbits, covering an area of 5.18 million km2.

In \na twist that was not known until after the end of \nthe Cold War, the Eastman Kodak camera flown on \nthe Lunar Orbiters was originally developed by the \nNational Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and flown \non the Samos E-1 spy satellite. The narrow-angle \npictures taken by this system provided resolution \nup to 60 to 80 meters, while the wide-angle photos \nshowed resolutions up to 0.5 kilometers. Lunar \nOrbiter I was launched into a parking orbit around \nEarth before its Agena upper stage fired at 20:04 \nUT to insert it on a translunar trajectory.

He was passionate about Mars, and that was one reason Bush \nchose him and why he accepted. Bush’s Moon-Mars program went nowhere \nwith Congress, as Goldin soon discovered, but he saw robotic exploration as \nan area where he could make progress toward the Red Planet. He replaced \nthe Science Mission Director he had inherited with Wesley Huntress, and \nlater—when Huntress left—with Ed Weiler. He found them both able and \nsupportive of his Mars goals. \nGoldin was retained as NASA Administrator by President Bill Clinton \nbecause Goldin’s faster, better, cheaper efficiency approach to program man\xad\nagement fit well with Clinton’s, and especially Vice President Al Gore’s, desire \nto launch a reinventing-government campaign. Goldin ultimately became \ntheir poster boy for the White House (and congressional) drive to accom\xad\nplish more for less. He also endeared himself to the White House through his \nleadership in the International Space Station Program. He was responsive to \nthe White House, and so the White House was responsive to him. \nThe occasion for a big decision involving the Red Planet came in 1993 \nwhen NASA’s Mars Observer, an orbiter, failed as it approached Mars. \nRather than lamenting the loss, Goldin used it to initiate a new Mars \nSurveyor program based on faster, better, cheaper principles. Calling Mars \nObserver a $1\xa0billion Battlestar Galactica, Goldin said his new program \nwould lower cost and risk. Instead of putting all experiments in one probe, \nNASA would divide them into smaller spacecraft sent every 26 months, \nwhen the Mars-Earth alignment was optimal. Getting a “program line” in \nthe budget approved by the White House and Congress was important to \nthis fast-paced strategy. In selling the concept of a long-term program to \nthe White House Office of Management and Budget and Congress, Goldin \nand his Science Associate Administrator, Wesley Huntress, argued that they \nwould get more science done in a less costly way.3 Mars exploration thus \nbecame an ongoing effort, with one mission setting the stage for the next. \nGoldin said that the robotic Mars Surveyor program, as it was called, was a \nshowcase for his faster, better, cheaper product line. This was an initiating \ndecision that rejuvenated the program at a point when it might otherwise \nhave gone onto the back burner.\nGoldin’s second big decision was one of reorientation.

His replacement, in what would be the last year of the Bush \nadministration, was a rising star from the defense side of the U.S. space pro\xad\ngram named Daniel Goldin. Goldin caught the attention of Quayle and the \nNational Space Council through his work with the Strategic Defense Initiative \nOrganization on short-schedule, low-cost space technology demonstration \nprojects. Goldin was a proponent of horizontal management structures and \nprojects executed under short time constraints, believing that longer sched\xad\nules allowed design changes, which in turn caused budgets to\xa0grow. \nIn 1992, President George H. W. Bush chose Goldin as the new NASA \nAdministrator and tasked him with the mission of changing NASA’s space \nexploration culture from the top down.

In NASA’s Planetary Exploration \nDivision, Goldin accepted plans to implement a Discovery program, which \nwould solicit proposals for small, cost-capped missions led by a Principal \nInvestigator, rather than having mission science parameters determined by', 'Promise Denied\n90\nAfter the expenditure of approximately $15 million [$23 million in 2016], \nboth Orbital and Rockwell went their separate ways to sort out lingering finan\xad\ncial obligations between them.77 The primary reason for Orbital’s final decision \nto terminate its participation in the first X-34 program appears to have been \nconcern over the commercial viability of the proposed vehicle. Ironically, it had \nbeen a detailed review that Orbital undertook during the temporary NASA \nsuspension that led officials to conclude that the X-34, as originally envisioned, \nwould not be economically viable from a commercial business standpoint. An \nunnamed Orbital official remarked afterward that “[w]e’re going back to the \ndrawing board…. [X-34] was not meeting our financial or technical goals. It \nwas a business decision.”78 \nThe termination of the first X-34 raised issues regarding the Government-\nindustry business model used for both the X-33 and X-34 programs. Goldin \nnoted that both the Government and the industry shared blame for not making \nthe necessary investment to lower launch costs below $10,000 per pound. He \nadded, however, that industry was spending hundreds of millions of dollars \non the Air Force evolved expendable launch vehicle (EELV) competition to \nupgrade the current fleet of United States expendable rockets but was unwilling \nto make credible investments in reusable vehicle programs such as the X-34. \n(In its defense, it may be said that the Air Force at this time was, of course, on \na sustained 24/7/365 wartime footing—and had been since August 1990—and \nhad far more serious funding issues to consider than finding money for RLVs.) \nGoldin also noted that if the industry was not willing to make the neces\xad\nsary investment, then NASA would convert the program to a “Government-\ntype program.” But, as OSTP had noted in its memo to Goldin, in this case, \nOrbital and Rockwell had made an extraordinary corporate commitment to \nthe X-34—their cost-share was nearly twice that of the Government’s—and \nthus they could hardly be faulted on that score.79 For his part, Gary Payton \ntook at least some comfort in having had the program canceled as quickly as \nit was, stating that\nIf the X-34 had been a conventional government contract with no \nindustry financial participation, we probably would have reached \nthe same decision, but maybe two years from now after all of \nthe government money was gone. So the fact that industry was \ncontributing their own money to this forced a very, very tough \ndecision very, very early.80\nFinally, in a June 12, 1996, prepared statement submitted to the House \nSubcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Goldin explained that the first X-34 \nprogram had combined “NASA’s need for early technology demonstration', 'NASA′s Discovery Program\nxii\nsiles, were the model for a reform. Soon after arriving, Wes Huntress introduced Dan \nGoldin to Discovery, which neatly fit the Administrator’s rhetoric about instituting \nFBC methods at NASA. Because of his reputation as a reformer, Goldin survived the \ntransition to the Bill Clinton administration in 1993. Thus, for most of the nineties, \nhis “faster, better, cheaper” methods would dominate the development of space science \nspacecraft. But FBC came to a sudden end in 1999, when two Mars spacecraft not part \nof Discovery failed upon reaching the Red Planet. The media and the political class \nheaped criticism on the agency, and Goldin became risk-averse.\nDiscovery’s Rise, Crisis, and Renewal\nBack in December 1992, NASA held its first workshop at San Juan Capistrano, \nCalifornia, to solicit mission ideas for Discovery. No fewer than 73 proposals were \naccepted from potential PIs, indicating that there was lively support in academia, the \nagency, and industry for the concept of competed small planetary missions. In early \n1993, Huntress chose 11 to be funded for further development. A year later, NASA \nreleased the first Announcement of Opportunity (AO), leading to the selection of the \nfirst competed mission, Lunar Prospector, in February 1995, plus an ensuing com\xad\npetition among three proposals. The winner was Stardust, a spacecraft to retrieve \na sample of particles from a comet’s tail. Two more selections were made each in \n1997, 1999, and 2001 (see “Discovery Missions” table). NEAR launched first, in early \n1996, and flew by asteroid Mathilde before heading to a rendezvous with Eros; Mars \nPathfinder made a spectacular landing on Independence Day, 1997, and deployed the \nmini-rover Sojourner. NEAR suffered an inflight crisis and missed Eros in 1999 but \nsuccessfully orbited in 2000 and made a landing in 2001, something not originally \nplanned. Thus, despite the political crisis of confidence that the 1999 Mars failures \ncreated, as well as Goldin’s retreat from FBC rhetoric and methods, Discovery looked \nto be a great success. It adhered to the early goals of frequent competitive selections \nand launches of PI-led projects supported by a variety of centers.\nThe crisis of Discovery came after 2002, when one spacecraft, CONTOUR, blew \nup as it was leaving Earth orbit, followed by several projects getting into trouble with \ncost and schedule. In its original conception, missions were to come under a cost \ncap ($150 million in 1992 dollars, without the launch vehicle) and be terminated if \nthey ran significantly over budget or behind schedule. As Goldin framed it, inflight \nfailures were to be expected in a “faster, better, cheaper” framework. The political \nand public reaction to the 1999 Mars failures showed how difficult that was. NASA \nand the Administrator were harshly criticized and ridiculed for incompetence and \nwasting the taxpayers’ money. Studies of those failures revealed weak management']","
Administrator Goldin initially rescinded U.S. involvement in the Cassini-Huygens mission due to its size and scope, which he found at odds with the reforms he was attempting to enact. However, ESA representatives strongly communicated their position to NASA management, the U.S. State Department, and Vice President Al Gore, expressing their concern about the United States' reliability as a partner in large scientific or technological endeavors if it backed out of the mission. This tactic was effective because the White House was courting ESA involvement in the International Space Station (ISS) effort, and ESA considered Cassini-Huygens a priority for reasons of international prestige and the potential to increase the capabilities of its member nations' aerospace industrial base. In the end, Administrator Goldin acquiesced, and Cassini-Huygens continued toward its successful launch in 1997."

One specific example of the program's impact on the aviation industry is the JN-4 flight research effort, which became the model for the NACA approach to aviation research from subsonic through supersonic flight. The NACA acquired and modified a PW-9 Army pursuit plane for flight research, and John W. ""Gus"" Crowley took the lead. The program organized a flight research program to support an Army Air Service request for technical information on various aircraft wing loading, center of gravity, pressure distribution at various angles of attack, physiological effects on pilots during maneuvers, and a host of other questions. Throughout the latter half of the 1920s, flight research at Langley proceeded using a variety of aircraft types. They concentrated on pressure distribution over airframes in the earliest projects, analyzing through repetition and variation what happened to the aircraft during level flight, pull-ups, rolls, spins, inverted flight, dives, and pulling out of dives. In late 1928, engineers reported that ""normal force coefficients obtained in maneuvers, pull-ups for example, are much larger than obtained from tests in steady flight or from wind tunnel tests.""

The brainchild of \nDr. Max Munk, a German engineer who came to work at the NACA’s Langley \nMemorial Aeronautical Laboratory (LMAL) in the early 1920s, the Variable \nDensity Tunnel (VDT)—only 34.5\xa0ft (10.5\xa0m) long and 15\xa0ft (4.6\xa0m) in diam\xad\neter—was the first pressurized wind tunnel in the world. This meant the VDT \ncould achieve more realistic effects than any previous wind tunnel to show how \nan actual aircraft would perform under flight conditions. The NACA had it \nbuilt at the nearby Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company and \nshipped to Langley by rail on 3 February 1922. It put the NACA and Langley \nlaboratory on the map and set in motion years of groundbreaking research.\nThe NACA gained approval to establish Langley in 1917 when Congress \napproved funding for a research and development (R&D) laboratory. Between \n1917 and 1920, the agency’s leadership scouted locations, acquired real estate, \nand built the first facilities at the new laboratory. It did not take long for the ele\xad\nments of aeronautical research—theoretical studies, wind tunnel tests, and flight \nresearch—to be implemented at Langley. The successes of those efforts brought \nto the NACA world renown before the end of the 1920s. The NACA’s wind tun\xad\nnels, especially the VDT, prompted research engineers to focus on aerodynamics. \nThe NACA’s research reports resulting from this work proved the stuff of \nlegend, routinely referred to by all that used them as a “bible” of knowledge \nabout a given subject, be it propellers, airfoils, or any other aspect of flight. \nLater in the 1920s and 1930s, the NACA’s research branched into engines, \nguidance and control, and materials. Although the organization never had \nmuch federal funding and carried out its mission without fanfare, the NACA \nbuilt the knowledge of flight and developed aeronautical technology second to \nnone for the United States.', 'Chapter 2:\u2002 Making a World-Class Aeronautics R&D Organization\n19\nJN-4 flight research effort became the model for the NACA approach to avia\xad\ntion research from subsonic through supersonic flight.\nIn 1924, the NACA acquired and modified a PW-9 Army pursuit plane \nfor flight research. John W. “Gus” Crowley took the lead. An MIT graduate, \nCrowley would become chief of the Langley Flight Test Section and a future \nNACA Associate Director for Research. He organized a flight research program \nto support an Army Air Service request for technical information on various \naircraft wing loading, center of gravity, pressure distribution at various angles \nof attack, physiological effects on pilots during maneuvers, and a host of other \nquestions.

It is manifest, \ntherefore, that the structural design of airplanes must be put on an indisputably \nsound basis. This means that design rules must be based more on known phenom\xad\nena, whether discovered analytically or experimentally, and less on conjecture.5\nBy the early 1930s, the NACA’s flight research program had established a \nreputation for excellence just as great as that of the wind tunnel work. The \nhistorian Michael H. Gorn has concluded: “First of all, its success did as much \nas any NACA activity to bring acclaim and reputation to this new institution. \nHenceforth, the military services, the universities, and the aircraft industries \nlooked to the NACA for research leadership and innovation….

In the tunnel’s vertical test section, aircraft models were \nmounted facing downward, and a blast of highly pressurized air would provide \nonly a minute of test time to see compressibility flows and aerodynamic flut\xad\nter on airframes in high-speed conditions. This tunnel proved so useful that \nengineers lobbied for one with a 24-inch test section, which was put into opera\xad\ntion late in 1934. This tunnel contained the first Schlieren photography system \ninstalled at Langley, allowing engineers to view dynamic airflows near Mach\xa01. \nThis work eventually made it possible to build fighters capable of exceeding \n400\xa0mph for the United States during World War II. \nThese wind tunnels, from the VDT to the FST and beyond, enabled the \nNACA to contribute groundbreaking research in aeronautics for the United \nStates. They were the instruments that made the agency, which was small and \nnot well-funded, the best in the world at aeronautical R&D by the time of \nWorld War II. \nGrowth and Development\nAviation advocates recognized the reason for investment in the NACA’s efforts \nbefore World War II. They recognized and emphasized the causal relationship \nbetween this investment and the resulting aircraft and the infrastructure sup\xad\nporting it. Despite this, there were different ideas over the appropriate role of \ngovernment within the aviation sector and shifting attitudes over time regard\xad\ning the overarching role of government R&D in the historical development of \nflight in the United States. During most of the NACA era, the agency’s role \nfocused on advancing key technologies for use in aircraft. The creation of a \nnational suite of wind tunnel facilities was a clear example of this function. The \ngovernment investment in this infrastructure, to the tune of several billion dol\xad\nlars when adjusted for inflation, serves as a reminder of the importance of the \ndevelopment of these crucial technologies.\nThe NACA faced the first years of the Great Depression in difficult circum\xad\nstances, as did so many of the institutions of the nation. The NACA, caught \nup in a controversy for being too closely aligned with the aeronautical indus\xad\ntry, had to be reorganized. NACA officers shifted committee assignments and \ncompositions to reduce the influence of industry members. At the same time, \nthe NACA instituted a policy of industry paying up front for research projects \ndesired from the NACA. It found a ready user in industry for its wind tunnels. \nThe success of these efforts allowed the agency to weather negative publicity \nand the general downturn of spending during the Great Depression.\nThe development of the NACA as an institution may be seen in its bud\xad\nget, staffing, and facilities.

Short-duration work was often aimed at resolving a \nspecific technical problem. One example of this approach was the effort to \nimprove the aerodynamic efficiency of aircraft.\nMany longer research projects took years and were redefined and given \nadditional funding repeatedly to pursue technological questions as they \nemerged. A good example of a longer-term effort was Research Authorization \n201, “Investigation of Various Methods of Improving Wing Characteristics by \nControl of the Boundary Layer,” signed on 21 January 1927. It provided for \nbroad-based research at the NACA on methods for airflow along the surface of \nthe wings, thereby improving the aerodynamics of flight. Research took place \nbetween 1927 and 1944, making a variety of twists and turns.

The NACA's flight research program in the 1920s and early 1930s significantly contributed to the establishment of a world-class aeronautics R&D organization by providing valuable insights and data on various aspects of aircraft performance and design. This research program gained fame for its high-quality work, which was comparable to that of the wind tunnel work.

One specific example is the NACA's research on pressure distribution over aircraft surfaces. In 1929, the NACA published the first seminal studies of aerodynamics of pressure distribution on aircraft, followed by a summary report in early 1930. This report set a new standard of knowledge and emphasized the importance of designing aircraft based on known phenomena rather than conjecture.

The flight research program also had a significant impact on the aviation industry. It won the NACA a reputation for research leadership and innovation, and the military services, universities, and aircraft industries began to look to the NACA for guidance. The flight research practitioners gained a place beside the theorists and wind tunnel experimentalists, further solidifying the NACA's position as a world-class aeronautics R&D organization.

Overall, the NACA's flight research program in the 1920s and early 1930s played a crucial role in establishing the NACA as a leading aeronautics R&D organization and had a significant impact on the aviation industry by providing valuable insights and data on aircraft performance and design."
Question: What is the significance of the MESSENGER mission in advancing Mercury science and answering fundamental questions about the planet?,"The MESSENGER mission, launched in 2004, was the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury after Mariner 10 in 1974. Its primary goal was to study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical composition of the planet. The mission's results provided global maps of Mercury, a wealth of information about its geochemistry, geology, geophysics, thin atmosphere, and active magnetosphere. The mission's data contributed significantly to the ability of the mission to be ""ambitious in its scientific scope for a Discovery mission, a tribute to the fact that scientific requirements guided the development of spacecraft and mission design at every stage in the project, from initial concept through all design trades and testing.""

The MESSENGER mission's significance in advancing Mercury science and answering fundamental questions about the planet is multifaceted. Prior to MESSENGER, Mercury was poorly understood, but the mission's science team found a number of surprising results, including flooding and explosive volcanism in early Mercury history, contraction of planetary geology on a global scale, a magnetic dipole aligned with the planet's spin axis, 60 to 70 percent iron contained in the planet's interior, and compelling support for the hypothesis that Mercury harbors abundant water ice and other frozen volatile materials in its permanently shadowed polar craters. These findings have greatly expanded our understanding of Mercury and its place in the solar system.

The MESSENGER mission's engineering achievements were also significant. The mission's science team significantly expanded the envelope of engineering practice, with the first operational demonstration of solar sailing using a large kite-like object to capture the solar wind. This technology has the potential to revolutionize space exploration by providing a low-cost, lightweight, and efficient means of propulsion.

In conclusion, the MESSENGER mission has greatly advanced our understanding of Mercury and its place in the solar system. Its scientific and engineering achievements have provided valuable insights into the geology, magnetic field, and chemical composition of the planet, as well as the potential for future space exploration using solar sailing technology.","['Chapter 5: Breaking the Bank\n175\nThe 2001 selection of MESSENGER for flight promised to advance Mercury sci\xad\nence immeasurably. NASA had not sent a spacecraft to Mercury since Mariner 10 in \n1974.14 Robert Strom, a professor emeritus at the University of Arizona Lunar and \nPlanetary Laboratory, had been lobbying for a return to Mercury since NASA’s last \nforay there.15 He became a co-investigator on MESSENGER. Much earlier, he in fact \nserved on Mariner 10 as deputy team leader for the imaging experiment. “Mariner 10 \nwas a mission that was designed as a reconnaissance of Mercury in order to characterize \nit to plan a Mercury orbiter,” he said. “That orbiter was supposed to be planned and \nlaunched by about 1980. Well, it’s been 30 years.”16\nAs Sean Solomon, the MESSENGER PI, said, “For nearly 30 years, we’ve had ques\xad\ntions that couldn’t be answered until technology and mission designs caught up with \nour desire to go back to Mercury.... Now we are ready.”17 A mission to Mercury had been \nstudied by both the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center, but \nthe costs in every case precluded its execution. The Mercury Dual Orbiter, a Goddard \nconcept and the last studied by the planetary program, came in at around $700 mil\xad\nlion. (MESSENGER was less than half that price.) The price tag, coupled with the \nrelatively low priority of Mercury exploration at NASA, meant it would never get the \ntraction necessary for flight. Discovery was a paradigm shift, though. The New Frontier \nprogram did not yet exist; Discovery was the only way such a mission would ever fly.\nScientific Questions\nMESSENGER sought to answer six fundamental questions, which trace their heritage \nback to the 1978 COMPLEX report coauthored by Solomon.\n1.\t What planetary formational processes led to Mercury’s high ratio of metal to \nsilicate?\n2.\t What is the geological history of Mercury?\n3.\t What are the nature and origin of Mercury’s magnetic field?\n4.\t What are the structure and state of Mercury’s core?\n5.\t What are the radar-reflective materials at Mercury’s poles?\n6.\t What are the important volatile species and their sources and sinks near \nMercury?18\n14 \t\nIbid.\n15 \t\nStauffer, T.

The \nteam wanted to cover as many bases as an orbiter would permit.21\nSolomon explained that, at the time, the most fundamental question the team was \nmost interested in answering is how Mercury got put together and what the processes \nwere that contributed to the inner planets turning out so differently from the outer \nplanets. “They formed by common processes,” he said. “The inner planets are all lit\xad\nter mates, if you will, products of a single early stage in the evolution of a star and a \nplanetary system.” To understand what processes most affected the outcomes, it was \nuseful to study Mercury, the most extreme of those outcomes.22\n“Mercury is an unusual planet even by the standards of the inner solar system,” \nelaborated Solomon, with “an unusual rotation rate such that the solar day on Mercury \n19 \t\nIbid.\n20 \t\nMcAdams, J., Farquhar, R., Taylor, A., & Williams, B.

Its density and mag\xad\nnetic field were comparable to Earth’s, but the planet is much smaller and made mostly \nof metal. All this was so, perhaps, because the interior region of the solar nebula was \nenriched in metals. Or maybe the planet was originally covered with a rocky surface \nthat baked off in the intense heat caused by its proximity to the Sun. Or it could be \nthat the crust broke off in an early impact. MESSENGER’s instruments, by measuring \nthe composition of the crust, would likely be able to distinguish between the three \nhypotheses and determine the planet’s original composition and its evolution. Moreover, \nthere was evidence that an unexpected material might be found in Mercury’s craters \nat the poles that are never exposed to sunlight. This material might have been frozen \nwater ice, comet-delivered sulfur, or silicates, hidden in the dark crevices that stay very \ncold, hundreds of degrees below zero.\nIts oddly strong magnetic field and unknown core size and composition were also \nunexplained.

Its primary goal was \nto study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical \ncomposition of the planet. It was the first mis\xad\nsion to Mercury after Mariner 10, more than 30 \nyears before. MESSENGER was launched into \nan initial parking orbit around Earth after which \nits PAM-D solid motor fired to put the spacecraft \non an escape trajectory into heliocentric orbit at \n0.92 × 1.08 AU and 6.4° inclination to the eclip\xad\ntic. The six-and-a-half-year road to Mercury was \npunctuated by several gravity-assist maneuvers \nthrough the inner solar system, including one flyby \nof Earth (on 2\xa0August 2005), two flybys of Venus \n(on 24\xa0October 2006 and 5 June 2007), and three \nflybys of Mercury (on 14 January 2008, 6 October \n2008, and 29 September 2009). The gravity-assist \nmaneuvers allowed the spacecraft to overcome the \nproblem of massive acceleration that accompanies \nflight toward the Sun; instead, the flybys helped \nto decelerate MESSENGER’s velocity relative to \nMercury and also conserve propellant for its orbital \nmission (although it prolonged the length of the \ntrip). The Earth flyby allowed mission controllers \nto properly calibrate all of the spacecraft’s instru\xad\nments while also returning spectacular images \nof the Earth–Moon system. During the second \nVenusian flyby (at a range of only 338 kilometers), \nMESSENGER relayed back a vast amount of data, \nincluding visible and near-infrared imaging data on \nthe upper atmosphere. Some of the investigations, \nespecially its study of the particle-and-fields char\xad\nacteristics of the planet, were coordinated with \nESA’s Venus Express mission. The three Mercury \nflybys further slowed down the spacecraft, although \nduring the last encounter in September 2009, \nMESSENGER entered a “safe mode” and, as a \nresult, collected no data on Mercury. Fortunately, \nthe spacecraft revived 7 hours later. MESSENGER \nfinally entered orbit around Mercury at 00:45 UT \n18 March 2011, nearly seven years after launch \nand began formal data collection on 4 April. The \nvehicle’s orbit was highly elliptical, approximately \n9,300 × 200 kilometers with a 12-hour orbital \nperiod. One of MESSENGER’s most remarkable \nimages was its mosaic of the Solar System, obtained \non 18\xa0 February 2011 with all the planets visible \nexcept Uranus and Neptune, a visual counterpart \nto the image of the solar system taken by Voyager\xa01 \non 14\xa0 February 1990.

Carrying a \nunique mini-helicopter, named Ingenuity, the mission tests the possibility of \nextending research on Mars using low-level flying vehicles. None of these mis\xad\nsions have yet solved the riddle of whether or not life has ever existed on Mars, \nbut all helped establish possibilities that such may have been the case. \nAt present, there are a few scientists who would go so far as to theorize \nthat perhaps some water is still present deep inside the planet. If so, micro\xad\norganisms might still be living beneath Mars’s polar caps or in subterranean \nhot springs warmed by vents from the Martian core. Scientists are quick to \nadd, however, that these are unproven theories for which evidence has not yet \nbeen\xa0discovered. \nOrbiting Mercury\nWhile other spacecraft had flown briefly in the vicinity of Mercury, the closest \nplanet to the Sun, not until 2004 did NASA launch the first mission to orbit \nand take a full measure of readings about the planet. Following a trajectory that \nrequired six planetary flybys, six propulsive maneuvers, and about six and a half \nyears, MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, \nGEochemistry, and Ranging) reached that sweltering terrestrial planet. The \nmission team significantly expanded the envelope of engineering practice, with \nthe first operational demonstration of solar sailing using a large kite-like object \nto capture the solar wind. \nPrior to the MESSENGER mission, Mercury was poorly understood, \nbut as the nearest planet to the Sun and the smallest of the four rocky plan\xad\nets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—it offered a critical anchor point \nfor understanding the solar system. During its operation between reaching \nMercury orbit on 17 March 2011 and the end of the program on 30 April 2015, \nMESSENGER’s science team found a number of surprising results, including \nflooding and explosive volcanism in early Mercury history, contraction of plan\xad\netary geology on a global scale, a magnetic dipole aligned with the planet’s spin \naxis, 60 to 70 percent iron contained in the planet’s interior, and compelling \nsupport for the hypothesis that Mercury harbors abundant water ice and other \nfrozen volatile materials in its permanently shadowed polar craters. \nReconnoitering the Outer Solar System\nAs NASA pursued science missions in the 1970s, it seized an opportunity avail\xad\nable every 176 years when gas giants in the outer solar system gathered on one']","
The MESSENGER mission is significant in advancing Mercury science as it promised to immeasurably advance the understanding of the planet. NASA had not sent a spacecraft to Mercury since Mariner 10 in 1974, and Robert Strom, a professor emeritus at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, had been lobbying for a return to Mercury since NASA’s last foray there. He became a co-investigator on MESSENGER. The mission sought to answer six fundamental questions, which trace their heritage back to the 1978 COMPLEX report coauthored by Solomon. These questions include the planetary formational processes that led to Mercury’s high ratio of metal to silicate, the geological history of Mercury, the nature and origin of Mercury’s magnetic field, the structure and state of Mercury’s core, the radar-reflective materials at Mercury’s poles, and the important volatile species and their sources and sinks near Mercury. The mission was significant in that it was the first orbiter to Mercury since Mariner 10 and aimed to answer long-standing questions about the planet."
Who is Grove Karl Gilbert and what are his contributions to the field of lunar craters research and Meteor Crater surveys?,"Grove Karl Gilbert was a prominent American geologist and astronomer who made significant contributions to the fields of lunar craters research and Meteor Crater surveys. In 1891, he conducted a survey of Meteor Crater in Arizona, which led him to consider a volcanic origin for the crater. However, after analyzing projectile experiments, telescopic observations, and lunar photographs, Gilbert concluded that the hypothesis of a meteor impact was more likely. He published his findings in 1896, in which he presented a theory of “The Origin of Hypotheses: Illustrated by the Discussion of a Topographic Problem.” Gilbert's work on lunar craters continued, and he proposed a theory that the craters on the Moon were formed by the collision of minor aggregations or moonlets. This theory was largely ignored by the scientific community at the time, but it would later be supported by evidence from spacecraft missions. Gilbert's contributions to the field of lunar craters research and Meteor Crater surveys were significant and influential.","['Chapter 1: Small Solar System Bodies Before the 20th Century\n25\nof the Arizona crater, the two rival hypotheses, his crucial tests, and the even\xad\ntual conclusion as a lesson in how to properly address a geological problem.30 \nIn the case of Gilbert’s “little limestone crater,” he had gone to Arizona with \na preferred theory in mind (impact) and by careful and correct scientific rea\xad\nsoning had completed the process of elimination, leaving with an altogether \ndifferent conclusion, that the crater was a product of a steam explosion.31 The \nentire episode amounted to an example of proper scientific conduct.\nAs we have seen, the very first time Gilbert heard of the Arizona crater, the \nlunar surface had leapt to his mind, and Meteor Crater has been linked to the \nMoon ever since. By Gilbert’s time, Earth’s Moon had become a planetary \nbody with a surface that could be resolved in ever more detail, making it avail\xad\nable for analysis using geological methods. Cooperation among and tensions \nbetween these disciplines touch on every aspect of near-Earth object studies \nand persist to the present day.32\nAfter his surveys at Meteor Crater, Gilbert investigated several nearby vol\xad\ncanic features before returning to Washington. As he wrote in the Survey’s \nAnnual Report, his investigations of potential mechanisms for volcanic steam \nexplosions led him “to give attention to the crateriform hollows of the moon, \nwhich have been ascribed by some writers to the impact of meteoric masses fall\xad\ning to its surface.”33 As he saw it, his experience as a geologist—“one who has \ngiven much thought to the origin of the forms of terrestrial topography”34—\nwas perfectly suited to addressing the puzzle of the lunar craters.\nUsing projectile experiments in the laboratory, telescopic observations of \nthe Moon, and analysis of lunar photographs,35 Gilbert, with his geologist’s \n30.\t Gilbert, “The Origin of Hypotheses,” p. 5.\n31.\t Ibid., p. 10.\n32.\t For example: “Interview of Eugene Shoemaker, June 27, 1994,” transcript of proceedings \nbefore the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC, p.\xa06.\n33.\t G.

Taken at the Lick Observatory, these photographs were provided \nby the Smithsonian Institution, with further aid from George E. Hale at the Kenwood \nPhysical Observatory in Chicago. Gilbert’s own telescopic observations were made \nin August, September, and October of 1892 at the U.S. Naval Observatory, using \nthe 26.5-inch refractor with a magnifying power of 400. This time period, which \nafforded 18 clear nights, allowed him to view the lunar surface through two full', 'A History of Near-Earth Objects Research\n24\nOctober in 1891.27 With his USGS colleague Marcus Baker, he carried out \ntwo tests to attempt to distinguish between the two outstanding hypotheses \nfor crater formation, steam explosion versus meteor impact. Both of these \ntests crucially relied upon the (now known to be erroneous) assumptions that, \ngiven an impact origin, the mass of the impacting body would be very large, \nmade of iron (hence magnetic), and buried beneath the crater floor. Under \nthese circumstances, the volume of the crater rim should exceed that of the \ncavity, part of that volume being occupied by the buried impactor. A detailed \ntopographic survey could compare these volumes, and this was the first of \nGilbert’s tests. The other relied on a magnetic survey of the region to look \nfor a buried magnetized mass. It only took a few days to see that neither test \nwas looking favorable for the impact hypothesis, and Gilbert ultimately con\xad\ncluded, “It follows, under my postulates, that the great meteor is not in the \nhole…chief attention should be given to other explanations of the crater.”28\nIn retrospect, it might seem obvious that Gilbert’s two crucial tests would \nfail, not because the impact hypothesis was wrong, but because his assump\xad\ntions about the buried “star” were incorrect. Today, Meteor Crater is known to \nhave been formed by an impact about 50,000 years ago, in which a 50-meter \nnickel-iron body struck Earth while traveling at about 12 kilometers per \nsecond, impacting, and mostly vaporizing altogether. Under these circum\xad\nstances, there could be no iron mass to be found beneath the crater floor. The \ndeveloping understanding of impact physics as an essentially explosive process \nwould make this clear by the middle of the 20th century, but for Gilbert, the \nevidence unequivocally ruled out the hypothesis he had originally favored, \nand he had to abandon it.29\nThis episode left such an impression on Gilbert that when he did eventually \npublish his results several years later, it was in the context of a philosophical \nargument. In his outgoing address as the president of the Geological Society of \nAmerica in 1895, he related his theory of “The Origin of Hypotheses: Illustrated \nby the Discussion of a Topographic Problem,” in which he presented the puzzle \n27.\t Grove Karl Gilbert, “The Origin of Hypotheses, Illustrated by the Discussion of a \nTopographic Problem,” Science III, 53 (1 January 1896): 5.\n28.\t Grove Karl Gilbert, “Notes Made in Arizona, Oct. 22–Nov. 19, 1891,” Index No. \n51, Accession No. 3448, U.S. Geological Survey Field Records File, U.S. National \nArchives, hereafter cited as Notebook 51, 14 November 1891.\n29.\t H.

Instead, many sci\xad\nentists would continue to believe well into the 20th century that they played \nno role in Earth’s history at all.\nA new chapter for Meteor Crater would open with the new century, and \nwith it, another look at the old problem of the craters on the Moon.', 'A History of Near-Earth Objects Research\n28\nMoon. A natural consequence of this formation scenario would be the “scars \nproduced by the collision of those minor aggregations, or moonlets, which \nlast surrendered their individuality.”41 By first gathering the impacting bodies \ninto a ring, Gilbert slowed them from a cosmic velocity to the escape velocity \nof the Moon, about 1.5 miles per second (2.38 kilometers per second) and \nallowed them to fall at much steeper impact angles. In this way, the distribu\xad\ntion of expected ellipticities could be brought closer into alignment with his \nanalysis of the shapes of craters measured on lunar photographs. Moreover, \nGilbert asserted, many disparate observations could be explained by his the\xad\nory, including the white streaks emanating from some craters and the fine \n“sculpture lines” radiating from Mare Imbrium, which he interpreted as the \nproduct of “the violent dispersion in all directions of a deluge of material—\nsolid, pasty, and liquid.”42\nToward the end of his exposition, in a section titled “Retrospect,” Gilbert \nreflected on his own thought process in formulating his moonlet theory, \ninvoking the same method of multiple working hypotheses that he would \nlater emphasize in his 1895 presidential address to the Geological Society of \nAmerica. Initially confronted with two hypotheses, and seeing how neatly \nthe impact theory could explain lunar crater characteristics (in contrast to \nthe volcanic theory, which could not), he was gradually converted “from \nthe attitude of a judge to the attitude of an advocate.”43 Gilbert also noted \nthat meteoric theories may have suffered from an unfair bias, since the plas\xad\nticity of rocks subjected to extreme pressures lies far outside the realm of \ncommon\xa0experience.\n“The Moon’s Face: A Study of the Origin of Its Features” was published in \nthe Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington (where Gilbert’s address \nhad been given), reprinted in Scientific American Supplement, and circulated \nwidely in abstract form. Despite this broad dissemination, however, it was \nlargely ignored, and what response it generated—from astronomers and \ngeologists alike—was overwhelmingly negative. Gilbert had known from the \nbeginning that his investigation of the lunar surface would encounter some \n41.\t Ibid., p. 262. To address the concern that a ring of moonlets would not produce a \nuniform distribution of impacts, he suggested that the impulses imparted to the Moon \nby the impacts themselves could have modified its rotation axis, thus randomizing the \nplacement of craters (p. 275).\n42.\t Ibid., pp. 261–285.\n43.\t Ibid., p. 287.', 'A History of Near-Earth Objects Research\n26\neye, scrupulously inspected the lunar topography and assessed each of the \nmajor theories of crater formation. He opened the resulting study with a sur\xad\nvey of key aspects of crater appearance and distribution, including a descrip\xad\ntion of their varying abundance by size, uneven distribution between the \nrough highlands and smoother maria, and overlapping relationships. He also \nnoted the differences in morphology between small craters and large ones, and \ndescribed qualitatively the scaling of depth with diameter in each of the two \nsize classes.36 These observations provided evidence for or against the volcanic \nand meteoric hypotheses for crater origins.\nWhereas his Arizona study had led Gilbert to consider a volcanic origin for \nMeteor Crater, this analysis convinced him of the opposite for the craters on \nthe Moon. To begin with, he noted that the sizes of lunar craters vastly over\xad\nshadow those of terrestrial volcanoes, and the enormous range of crater sizes \nis entirely unlike the distribution of Earth’s features. An even bigger problem, \nGilbert argued, was the vast disparity in form. The most common type of ter\xad\nrestrial volcano, the stratovolcano (e.g., Mount Vesuvius), with its tall sloping \nsides, relatively shallow caldera, and misshapen or altogether absent central \ncones, looks very different from the typical crater described at the beginning \nof his paper. “Thus,” he concluded, “through the expression of every feature \nthe lunar crater emphatically denies kinship with the ordinary volcanoes of \nthe earth.”37\nTurning to the meteoric hypothesis, Gilbert cited Richard A. Proctor’s The \nMoon (1873) as the oldest developed theory he could find, also mentioning an \n1882 article by A. Meydenbauer and another theory “said to be contained in \nDie Physiognomie de Monde, by ‘Asterios,’ Nordlingen, 1879.”38 These theories \nfaced difficult obstacles in Gilbert’s view. First, the lunar craters were far too \nlarge to have been formed by any meteors that had ever been observed to \nlunations, during which the terminator—where the illumination angle is lowest and \nthe topography most exaggerated—passed over every part of the lunar disk.\n36.\t Ibid., pp. 243–248.\n37.\t Ibid., pp. 250–252. Gilbert also considered shield volcanoes and maars but found only \nthe latter to be a plausible analog, and only then in the case of the smallest lunar craters. \nHe also dismissed a tidal origin for the craters and a hypothesis involving ice buildup.\n38.\t Ibid., p. 257; Richard Anthony Proctor, The Moon: Her Motions, Aspect, Scenery \nand Physical Condition (London: Longmans, Green, 1873); A.

Grove Karl Gilbert was a prominent American geologist and astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of lunar craters research and Meteor Crater surveys. He was a member of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and conducted extensive research on lunar craters, including the famous lunar crater Copernicus. Gilbert's work on lunar craters involved studying their morphology, size, and distribution, and he proposed that they were formed by the impact of meteorites. He also conducted surveys of Meteor Crater in Arizona, which he believed was formed by a meteorite impact. Gilbert's research on Meteor Crater involved studying its structure, composition, and origin, and he concluded that it was formed by a meteorite impact. His work on lunar craters and Meteor Crater helped establish the field of impact cratering and has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the solar system."
What is the Torino Scale and how is it used to categorize potential Earth impact events? (Refer to Figure 6-4),"The Torino Scale is a tool for categorizing potential Earth impact events, primarily intended for public communication by the asteroid impact hazard monitoring community. It ranges from 0 (no hazard) to 10 (red), with colors introduced to represent no threat (0, white), an extremely low threat level (1, green), a threat meriting attention by astronomers (2–4, yellow), threatening (5–7, orange), and certain collision (8–10, red). However, this scale does not consider the time remaining until the potential impact. To provide a scale more useful to the scientific community for prioritizing objects for additional observations and analysis, Steven Chesley and his colleagues introduced the Palermo Scale, which seeks to include the time proximity as well as the impact probability and potential impact energy. This scale is named after the 2001 international conference on NEOs held in Palermo, Italy.","['Chapter 6: Automating Near-Earth Object Astronomy\n171\nDiagram showing the\n Torino Scale.

Alvarez and geologist Walter Alvarez, it posited that a \nroughly 10-kilometer asteroid had impacted somewhere on Earth about 65 \nmillion years ago, at the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene \nperiods of Earth’s history.1 The enormous amount of pulverized rock and \ndust thrown into the atmosphere would have produced a years-long darkness, \nexplaining the mass extinction already known to have occurred.2 Their argu\xad\nment was based on discovery of a thin clay layer enriched in iridium, a metal \nthat is rare on Earth’s surface but common in meteorites. While many other \nscientists had proposed that large impacts could produce mass extinctions, \n1.\t\nThe Paleogene period (66 mega annum [Ma] to 23 Ma) was formerly part of the Tertiary \nperiod (66 Ma to 2.5 Ma), and the extinction event referred to as the Cretaceous–\nTertiary extinction, often shorthanded as “K–T.” The International Commission on \nStratigraphy abandoned the Tertiary nomenclature in 2008, and the current term for \nthe timing of the extinction event is “K–Pg.”\n2.\t\nLuis W.

The Torino Scale is a tool adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1999 to categorize potential Earth impact events. It is an integer scale ranging from 0 to 10, with associated color coding, primarily intended to facilitate public communication by the asteroid impact hazard monitoring community. The scale captures the likelihood and consequences of a potential impact event but does not consider the time remaining until the potential impact. Higher Torino Scale values indicate more extraordinary events.

The Torino Scale has several levels to categorize the events:

- No Hazard (White Zone): The likelihood of a collision is zero or effectively zero. This level also applies to small objects such as meteors and bodies that burn up in the atmosphere, as well as infrequent meteorite falls that rarely cause damage.

- Normal (Green Zone): A routine discovery in which a pass near Earth that poses no unusual level of danger is predicted. The chance of collision is extremely unlikely, with no cause for public attention or concern. New telescopic observations will likely lead to reassignment to Level 0.

- Meriting Attention by Astronomers (Yellow Zone): A discovery, which may become routine with expanded searches, of an object making a somewhat close but not highly unusual pass near Earth. While meriting attention by astronomers, there is no cause for public attention or concern as an actual collision is very unlikely. New telescopic observations will likely lead to reassignment to Level 0.

The Torino Scale also includes other levels, such as Meriting Concern (Orange Zone), Threatening (Red Zone), and Certain Collision (Brown Zone), which represent increasing levels of likelihood and consequences of potential Earth impact events."

"How did the Soviet Union assign official names to their spacecraft, particularly in the case of missions that failed to reach Earth orbit or left Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space? Provide examples to illustrate your answer.","The Soviet Union assigned official names to their spacecraft, particularly in the case of missions that failed to reach Earth orbit or left Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space, using a convention that was complicated by the fact that beginning with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and until the late 1980s, the Soviets never announced or acknowledged a mission if it failed to reach Earth orbit or if it left Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space. In these cases, the Soviets adopted two strategies:

- Between 1960 and 1963, the Soviets simply never admitted their existence and made no announcement.
- Beginning November 1963, the Soviet media began to give these stranded-in-Earth-orbit spacecraft ""Kosmos"" numbers. So, the deep space vehicle launched on 11 November 1963 that reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space was simply given the ""next"" Kosmos number, in this case ""Kosmos 21."" By giving it such a nondescript name (""Kosmos 21""), Soviet officials sought to draw attention away from such failures.

For example, the third and fourth stages separated abnormally, and after reaching Earth orbit, ground control lost telemetry (at about 06:45:44 UT) from the Blok L upper stage designed to send the vehicle past the Moon. As a result, the spacecraft remained stranded in Earth orbit. The stage's main engine turbopump probably exploded upon ignition destroying the spacecraft. With this mission, the Soviets began the practice of giving ""Kosmos"" designations to obscure the failure of lunar and planetary probes that remained stranded in Earth orbit. If the spacecraft had successfully departed from Earth orbit, it would probably have been called ""Zond 1.""

Another example is the Mars 2 mission, which entered Earth orbit successfully (145 × 159 kilometers at 51.5° inclination), but the Blok D upper stage failed to fire the second time to send the spacecraft to Mars. Later investigation showed that there had been human error in programming the firing time for the Blok. Apparently, the timer that would ignite the Blok D was incorrectly programmed to fire after","['xv\nA Note About Terminology\nMission Designations\nI \nhave made every attempt to use the names of \nspacecraft and missions that were contempora\xad\nneous to the time of the mission and assigned by the \nagency or organization implementing the\xa0missions.\nIn the 1960s, NASA routinely used Roman \nnumerals for missions (Mariner IV, Mariner V, etc.) \nin their official documentation, but these were dis\xad\ncontinued in the 1970s. Readers will note that I \nhave used this convention for all missions until and \nincluding 1970 but after that switched to Latin \nnumbers (Mariner 9, Mariner 10, etc.). This divi\xad\nsion is somewhat arbitrary but was necessary not to \nconfuse readers.\nThe practice of giving spacecraft “official” \nnames is complicated by the fact that beginning \nwith the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and until the \nlate 1980s, the Soviet Union never announced or \nacknowledged a mission if it failed to reach Earth \norbit. In addition, for those lunar and planetary \nprobes that did reach Earth orbit but failed to leave \nit, the Soviets adopted two strategies:\n•\t between 1960 and 1963, the Soviets simply \nnever admitted their existence and made no \nannouncement; and\n•\t beginning November 1963, the Soviet media \nbegan to give these stranded-in-Earth-orbit \nspacecraft “Kosmos” numbers. So, the deep \nspace vehicle launched on 11 November 1963 \nthat reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for \ndeep space was simply given the “next” Kosmos \nnumber, in this case “21.” By giving it such a \nnondescript name (“Kosmos 21”), Soviet offi\xad\ncials sought to draw attention away from such \nfailures. This practice was followed well into \nthe late 1980s.\nFor both of these three types of missions, I have \nused the following convention:\n[Program, Spacecraft design designation, serial \nnumber]\nOR\nKosmos number [Program]\nI do not use terms such as “Marsnik 1” or “Mars \n1960A” (listed in the National Space Science \nData Center, for example, to denote the spacecraft \nlaunched on 10 October 1960). Since the Soviets \nnever used such names, it would be entirely inac\xad\ncurate to ascribe such designations. Such fictitious \nnames (such as “Sputnik 27”) unfortunately prolif\xad\nerate online but are Western inventions.\nLaunch Sites\nFor Soviet and Russian launch sites, the following \nconventions apply:\n“Site A / B” implies that the probe was launched \nfrom Site A, Launch Unit B\nMission Goals\nThere are good reasons not to use terms such as \n“flyby” or “flight” since spacecraft do not fly. As \none of the reviewers for this manuscript pointed \nout, these terms are remnants of the era of aero\xad\nnautics. As such, more appropriate terms would \nbe “swingby” (instead of “flyby”) and “mission” \n(instead of “flight”). However, because terms \nsuch as “flyby” and “flight” are still widely used by \nmany space agencies globally, this manuscript has \nretained their use, despite their imprecise nature.', '35\n1963\u2003\n“Object-Probes” (ob’yekt-zond) were designed to \nverify key technological systems during simpler \nmissions into deep space and back to Earth. A gov\xad\nernment decree on March 21, 1963 had approved \ntwo to three such “object-probe” missions, one of \nwhich (a 3MV-1A) was designed to depart from \nEarth’s ecliptic (the orbital plane of Earth around \nthe Sun) out to 12–16 million kilometers from \nEarth and then return back to Earth after about \nsix months when its orbit intersected with that of \nEarth again, aided by two mid-course corrections \nusing its S5.45 main engine. The latter, capable of \ntwo firings, was a lighter version of that used on \nthe 2MV model with higher specific impulse and \na longer burn time. During this mission, the third \nand fourth stages separated abnormally, and after \nreaching Earth orbit, ground control lost teleme\xad\ntry (at about 06:45:44 UT) from the Blok L upper \nstage designed to send the vehicle past the Moon. \nAs a result, the spacecraft remained stranded in \nEarth orbit. The stage’s main engine turbopump \nprobably exploded upon ignition destroying the \nspacecraft. With this mission, the Soviets began \nthe practice of giving “Kosmos” designations to \nobscure the failure of lunar and planetary probes \nthat remained stranded in Earth orbit. If the space\xad\ncraft had successfully departed from Earth orbit, it \nwould probably have been called “Zond 1.”', '100\nBEYOND EARTH: A CHRONICLE OF DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION, 1958–2016\nvehicles, Soviet planners added a third mission, \nthe M-71S, a simple orbiter that could become \nthe first spacecraft to go into orbit around Mars. \nThe orbiter could also collect data important for \naiming the two landers at precise locations on the \nMartian surface. These new vehicles were the first \nSoviet robotic spacecraft to have digital computers \n(the S-530), which was a simplified version of the \nArgon-11 carried on the 7K-L1 (“Zond”) circum\xad\nlunar spacecraft. The first of these Mars space\xad\ncraft entered Earth orbit successfully (145 × 159 \nkilometers at 51.5° inclination), but the Blok D \nupper stage failed to fire the second time to send \nthe spacecraft to Mars. Later investigation showed \nthat there had been human error in programming \nthe firing time for the Blok. Apparently, the timer \nthat would ignite the Blok D was incorrectly pro\xad\ngrammed to fire after 150 hours instead of 1.5 \nhours. (One report claimed that a programmer \nincorrectly programmed the time in years instead \nof hours). The stranded spacecraft, which was \nnamed Kosmos 419 by the Soviet press, reentered \nEarth’s atmosphere within two days of launch. \nThe Soviets had promised the French that two of \ntheir Stéréo-1 instruments would be sent to Mars \nduring the 1971 window, but since one was lost on \nKosmos 419 which had officially nothing to do with \na Mars mission, Soviet officials were forced to keep \nsilent about its fate. \n125\nMars 2\nNation: USSR (77)\nObjective(s): Mars orbit and landing\nSpacecraft: M-71 (4M no. 171)\nSpacecraft Mass: 4,650 kg\nMission Design and Management: GSMZ imeni \nLavochkina\nLaunch Vehicle: Proton-K + Blok D (8K82K no. \n255-01 + 11S824 no. 1201L)\nLaunch Date and Time: 19 May 1971 / 16:22:49 UTA ground model of the ProP-M mobile device that was installed on the Soviet Mars landers for the 1971 missions.

The Soviet Union assigned official names to their spacecraft using a specific convention. For missions that successfully reached Earth orbit and left for deep space, they used the format [Program, Spacecraft design designation, serial number]. For example, the spacecraft launched on 11 November 1963 that reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space was given the ""next"" Kosmos number, in this case, ""21."" This practice was followed well into the late 1980s.

However, for missions that failed to reach Earth orbit or left Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space, the Soviet Union never announced or acknowledged their existence until the late 1980s. In such cases, they adopted two strategies:

1. Between 1960 and 1963, the Soviets simply never admitted their existence and made no announcement.
2. Beginning November 1963, the Soviet media began to give these stranded-in-Earth-orbit spacecraft ""Kosmos"" numbers.

For example, the deep space vehicle launched on 11 November 1963 that reached Earth orbit but failed to leave for deep space was simply given the ""next"" Kosmos number, in this case, ""21."" By giving it such a nondescript name (""Kosmos 21""), Soviet officials sought to draw attention away from such failures.

Therefore, the Soviet Union did not use terms such as ""Marsnik 1"" or ""Mars 1960A"" to denote the spacecraft launched on 10 October 1960. Such fictitious names (such as ""Sputnik 27"") unfortunately proliferate online but are Western inventions."

In 1977, \nhe had proposed a dedicated “Spacewatch Telescope,” similar to the 1.2-meter \nSchmidt he had used on Palomar, but larger and dedicated exclusively to the \nhunt for near-Earth objects.14 That proposal went nowhere. In early 1980, \nhe tried again, teaming up with Gene Shoemaker, Robert McMillan, and \nseveral other colleagues, this time proposing a dedicated 1.8-meter CCD-\nbased Spacewatch camera and data-processing system that would be installed \nin an existing dome on Kitt Peak, operated by the University of Arizona’s \nSteward Observatories. This proposal was not funded either; at a June 1980 \nmeeting with William E. Brunk and Geoffrey Briggs, the astronomy pro\xad\ngram officials at NASA Headquarters, he was told that NASA did not see the \nconstruction of ground telescopes as part of its mission, and that they were \nconcerned about “the possibility of unforeseen technical problems that would \ncause delays and cost overruns.” The “agonizing delays and overruns” of the \nnew Infrared Telescope Facility, built on Maunakea and completed in 1979, \nwere fresh on their minds.15\nBut Brunk and Briggs supported the scientific goals of the proposal, which \nincluded finding Earth-approaching asteroids that could be visited by future \nSpace Shuttle–based missions and improving understanding of what Gehrels \nhad called the “hazard aspect” of near-Earth objects. NEOs were a hazard due \nto the “low but finite” probability of a catastrophic impact, but the actual risk \ncould not be quantified adequately. “The problem would no longer be statisti\xad\ncal in nature if all the Earth-crossing asteroids down to about 150 meters in \ndiameter were detected and their orbits accurately determined. Any collision \nthat might occur in the near term (next few decades) could be forecast,” Gehrels \nhad contended.16 So Brunk was willing to fund a design study for the facil\xad\nity—in NASA’s jargon, this was to be a Phase A study.\n14.\t Tom Gehrels and Richard P.

Question: What was the significance of the Altitude Wind Tunnel (AWT) in the development of jet propulsion technology in the United States during the immediate postwar period?,"The Altitude Wind Tunnel (AWT) was the centerpiece facility of the NACA-Lewis laboratory, which was built in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1944. The AWT was capable of testing full-scale engines and propellers in simulated altitude conditions. The researchers in Cleveland addressed the next major engine development problem facing the American aviation production program, the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engine, when the AWT opened in May 1944. Tests in the AWT led to improved exhaust turbines and the elimination of high-altitude fuel-vaporization problems, which increased the B-29's payload capacity by 5½ tons and permitted improved high-altitude operation. The AWT was unrivaled in its capability to test full-scale engines and propellers in simulated altitude conditions, and it was at the intersection of the work of the NACA, Government, industry, and the military. The AWT played a significant role in the development of jet propulsion technology in the United States during the immediate postwar period.","['The Power for Flight\n30\nThe NACA’s failure to anticipate the pure turbojet developments in \nGermany and Britain prior to the Second World War seriously damaged its \nreputation with the military, particularly with Hap Arnold’s Army Air Forces. \nAfterward, due to its failure to anticipate jet propulsion before 1941 and the \ndistraction of the failed Jacobs ducted fan during the critical early years of \nthe war, Arnold effectively took the NACA out of the leading edge of aircraft \npropulsion by giving GE the task of developing the Whittle engine. Instead, \nthe NACA was given the task of testing already-developed engines from GE \nand Westinghouse in its Static Test Laboratory.99\nAll in all, the NACA’s Cleveland engine laboratory had a remarkable blind \neye when it came to jet propulsion. No consideration was given to the field at \nall in the development of the facility. The great potential significance of the \njet engine was enunciated by George Lewis in August 1943.100 Afterward, by \nMarch 1944, a complete transformation toward work on jet propulsion had \noccurred at the agency.101 Meanwhile, in October 1943, Kervork Nahigyan \nand his staff in the Static Laboratory built and tested the first afterburner, a \ndirect byproduct of the work on the burner for Jake’s Jeep.102\nAbe Silverstein and his group adapted the AWT to test jet engines and \nacquired hands-on experience in jet technology. During the AWT facility’s \nfirst runs in February 1944, NACA researchers used the AWT to support \nnew turbojet technology, specifically the 1,600-pound-thrust GE I-16 turbojet \ninstalled in a complete Bell P-59 Airacomet fuselage. The Cleveland labora\xad\ntory’s use of the AWT produced a succession of turbojet advancements that \nresulted in a surge of thrust capabilities in the late 1940s and early 1950s. \nIn June 1944, Lockheed’s YP-80A Shooting Star became the first jet aircraft \ncompletely manufactured in the United States and the first U.S. aircraft to \nfly faster than 500 mph. The Altitude Wind Tunnel was used in the spring \nof 1945 to study the performance of the Shooting Star’s two 3,750-pound-\nthrust GE I-40 engines at high altitudes. An attempt to forecast thrust levels at \naltitude, based on sea-level measurements, was successful, and a performance \ncurve was created to predict the I-40’s thrust at all altitudes. The production \nP-80 fighter with the I-40 engine proved a great success in the early days of \nthe U.S. Air Force, spawning two important derivatives, the T-33 trainer and \nthe F-94 interceptor.103\nLewis was the only facility capable of testing gas turbines in a comprehensive \nmanner during the immediate postwar period. The NACA researchers there \nwould build upon this experience to become the U.S. Government’s experts \nin jet propulsion technology immediately after the war.', 'The NACA and Aircraft Propulsion, 1915–1958\n21Floor plan for the NACA-Lewis Altitude Wind Tunnel.

The researchers in Cleveland addressed the next \nmajor engine development problem facing the American aviation production \nprogram, the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engine, when the AWT \nopened in May 1944. Four turbosupercharged 18-cylinder R-3350s, each rated \nat 2,200 horsepower, powered the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, then the most \nadvanced airplane in the world, with a highly refined streamlined design, all-\nmetal monoplane construction, retractable landing gear, a pressurized cabin, \nand an advanced electronically based centralized defensive weapon system \nincorporating remotely operated turrets fired by gunners in sighting cupolas. \nCapable of carrying 16,000 pounds of bombs and cruising at 235 mph at \naltitudes of up to 30,000 feet, the B-29 was also the only strategic bomber \nthat could reach Japan from American air bases in the Pacific. But it had a \ndrawback: the R-3350, one of the most complex piston engines ever produced, \nexperienced overheating and catastrophic engine fires due to rushed develop\xad\nment. Tests in the AWT led to improved exhaust turbines and the elimination \nof high-altitude fuel-vaporization problems, which increased the B-29’s pay\xad\nload capacity by 5½ tons and permitted improved high-altitude operation.75 \nBeginning in November 1944, units of the U.S. Army Air Forces’ 20th Air \nForce initiated the strategic bombing of Japanese cities, culminating in August \n1945 with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.', 'The Power for Flight\n18\nof a new NACA aeronautical laboratory in Cleveland, OH. The centerpiece of \nthe new facility would be an Altitude Wind Tunnel (AWT), which simulated \nan altitude of 30,000 feet at 490 mph and allowed focused testing of engines, \nsuperchargers, and propellers individually or as complete propulsion systems. \nOther facilities included wind tunnels and laboratories capable of investigating \nmodel and full-scale engines; fuels and lubricants; and components includ\xad\ning superchargers, carburetors, instruments, and fuel and ignition systems. \nUltimately, the new propulsion laboratory would be at the intersection of the \nwork of the NACA, Government, industry, and the military. The NACA was \nto fill the gap left open by industry with an emphasis on development and \nproduction, not fundamental research, rooted in national defense and ensuring \nthe future of commercial aviation.\nBefore the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, \nNACA Chairman Vannevar Bush requested $8.4 million for the construction \nof a new laboratory focused on aircraft propulsion. His appeal was not an easy \nproposition that won ready acceptance. There was considerable resistance, \ncentered on the nature of research versus development, as well as the cost, \nfrom Congress and engine manufacturers. The House committee members \nmisunderstood the difference between fundamental research and engineering \ndevelopment and questioned the need for additional Government funding. \nThe manufacturers felt the money was better spent in the form of direct grants \nthat allowed them to focus on developing their specific products. The NACA \nendeavored to take competition and exclusion out and introduce fundamental \nengineering into the equation.67 The Dunkirk evacuation and the fall of France \nin June 1940 added additional impetus to the creation of a dedicated aircraft \nengine research laboratory. The First National Defense Appropriations Act of \nJune 1940 authorized the new laboratory.\nCleveland was a leading center of aviation. It was home to Thompson \nProducts, the maker of automotive and aircraft engine parts, primarily the ever-\ncrucial intake and exhaust valves found in all aircraft engines. Every September, \nhundreds of thousands of people swarmed the grandstands and displays of the \nNational Air Races. The city on the Lake Erie shore was also a water, rail, road, \nand air transportation hub connecting the East Coast, the Midwest, and the \nWest. Thompson Products president Frederick C. Crawford led the effort to \nbring the NACA to Cleveland. The city made 200 acres adjacent to the airport \navailable to the Federal Government for just $500. On November 25, 1940, \nCleveland civic leaders proudly announced the city’s selection as the site for \nthe new flight propulsion laboratory.68\nThe NACA’s activities in Cleveland during World War II were far from fun\xad\ndamental. World War II resulted in a change in focus. The NACA in Cleveland \nfocused on improving the performance and reliability of existing engines', ""The Power for Flight\n34\nDespite the emphasis on military aircraft, the development of turbojet \nengines for commercial use was reaching a new level of importance. The \nPratt & Whitney JT3s that powered the pioneering Boeing 707 and Douglas \nDC-8 airliners as they opened the age of mass jet travel were adaptations \nof the highly successful J57 military engines. Lewis Associate Director Abe \nSilverstein and Physics Division Chief Newell D. Sanders proclaimed in April \n1956 that the “age of the jet transport has arrived.”116 Although these engines \nwere designed for speed above all other criteria, they caused specific problems \nin the areas of noise, reliability, and safety, among other issues, when compared \nto piston\xa0engines.\nToward the Turboprop\nThe apparent primacy of the jet in the immediate years after World War\xa0II \nled one popular aviation writer to ask, “Has the propeller a future?”117 The \npropeller community conducted numerous wind tunnel and flight research \nexperiments in conjunction with similar investigations by industry to see The General Electric TG-100, the nation's first turboprop aircraft engine, was tested for two months in the Altitude Wind Tunnel starting in November 1946. General operating characteristics, windmilling, engine components, and engine starting were studied as the TG-100 was run at 8000 to 13000 rpm and at altitudes from 5,000 to 35,000 feet.\nFigure 1-12. Besides the turbojet, NACA researchers in Cleveland, OH, investigated other \nnew propulsion technologies. The first turboprop flown in the United States, the GE TG-100A, \nunderwent tests in a streamlined nacelle to determine the performance characteristics of the \ncompressor and turbine in the Altitude Wind Tunnel in late 1946. (NASA)"", 'NACA to NASA to Now\n22\nOf course, it was the VDT at Langley that really set the NACA on a firm \nfooting in terms of ground-based research. This success led directly to the estab\xad\nlishment of several other wind tunnels at Langley by the latter 1920s. Another \npathbreaking tunnel at Langley was the 7- by 10-foot Atmospheric Wind \nTunnel (AWT), which began operations in 1930. It provided the capability to \nstudy high-lift wings and general problems of stability and control. The AWT \nestablished itself almost immediately as an exceptionally versatile research tool. \nFour additional wind tunnels followed, each contributing to knowledge about \nairfoil shapes, airframe aerodynamics, guidance and control systems, and drag \nreduction. These wind tunnels also aided in pursuing understanding of the \npressures on airframes, the compressibility problem, and aerodynamic loads \nand stresses on the aircraft.\nThereafter, the NACA built another wind tunnel to test propellers. The \nbrainchild of Director of Research George W. Lewis, the Propeller Research \nTunnel (PRT) was large enough to place aircraft with their propellers operating \nin the test section. The PRT demonstrated its worth almost at once. In addi\xad\ntion to propeller research, it could be used for aerodynamic drag research, and \nNACA engineers found that exposed landing gears contributed up to 40\xa0per\xad\ncent of fuselage drag. Retractable landing gear emerged from this project as the \nstate of the art for aircraft seeking greater speeds. PRT engineers also found that \nmulti-engine aircraft performed best when engine nacelles were built in-line \nwith the wing. These results influenced every major aircraft of the latter 1930s \nand may be seen in the shape of the DC-3 transport and both the B-17 and \nB-24 bombers of World War II.\nIn addition, the NACA built in the mid-1930s its preeminent wind tunnel \nbefore World War II, the so-called “Full-Scale Tunnel” (FST). Built under the \ndirection of Smith J. De France, the FST boasted a 30- by 60-foot test section, \nwith an open throat that facilitated the installation of full-size aircraft. Two \nmassive propellers, driven by two 4,000-horsepower electric motors, pushed air \nthrough the test section at speeds between 25 and 118 miles per hour (mph). \nOnce completed in 1931, the FST tunnel building offered an imposing site \non the Langley campus with its large air-handling system and imposing brick \noffice and research structure. Operating until the 1990s, the FST had a pro\xad\nfound influence on the course of American aeronautical research and develop\xad\nment. Likewise, a 19-foot pressure tunnel also helped to advance the state of \nthe art in 1939 when completed. Virtually every advanced aircraft of World \nWar II was tested in these two tunnels as well as many commercial vehicles and \nspacecraft from the NASA era.\nFinally, the completion of the NACA’s High Speed Tunnel (HST), with \na 22-inch test section, in 1934 enabled engineers to undertake research in']","
The Altitude Wind Tunnel (AWT) played a significant role in the development of jet propulsion technology in the United States during the immediate postwar period. It was the only facility capable of testing gas turbines in a comprehensive manner during that time. NACA researchers at the facility built upon their experience to become the U.S. Government's experts in jet propulsion technology immediately after the war.

The AWT was used to study the performance of the Shooting Star's two 3,750-pound-thrust GE I-40 engines at high altitudes. An attempt to forecast thrust levels at altitude, based on sea-level measurements, was successful, and a performance curve was created to predict the I-40's thrust at all altitudes. This advancement was crucial as it led to the production of the P-80 fighter with the I-40 engine, which proved to be a great success in the early days of the U.S. Air Force, spawning two important derivatives, the T-33 trainer and the F-94 interceptor.

Therefore, the Altitude Wind Tunnel was instrumental in the development and testing of jet propulsion technology in the United States during the immediate postwar period, contributing to the success of early jet aircraft and the establishment of the U.S. as a leader in jet propulsion technology."
"What is the Discovery Program's approach to maximizing science return within the program cost cap, as opposed to looking for ""science per dollar""?","The Discovery Program's approach to maximizing science return within the program cost cap is a subtle but important distinction that drove proposal strategy. In the past, proposers may have underbid as a strategy, coming in with plenty of ""room to the cap,"" in the hopes of securing funding for their mission concept. However, the Discovery Program's focus on optimizing science return within the cost cap has led to a different approach.

The program's strategy is to ensure that the proposed mission concept is mature enough to be executable within mission constraints, rather than simply focusing on cost per dollar. Cost model results are primarily used as indicators of areas that need to be more closely examined, rather than as a primary factor in the evaluation process.

This approach is driven by the reality that program reserve is often the first to get ""swept up"" by budget analysts, division directors, and others looking for uncommitted money to rescue a development project from overruns in the current fiscal year. Larger sums attract more attention, and Discovery AOs have been postponed on several occasions over the second decade of the Discovery Program.

In light of this, the Discovery Program has released AOs without a specific annual funding profile, allowing for more flexibility in the evaluation process. The goal is to ensure that the proposed mission concept is executable within mission constraints, rather than simply focusing on cost per dollar.

Overall, the Discovery Program's approach to maximizing science return within the program cost cap is driven by a focus on mission maturity and execution, rather than simply cost per dollar. This approach ensures that the proposed mission concept is executable within mission constraints, rather than simply focusing on cost per dollar.","['Chapter 8: Lessons Learned from the Evolution of the Program\n297\nthe NASA strategic plan, but the strategic plans can be quite broad. Even the strictest \ninterpretation of requirements allowed Discovery missions to focus their investiga\xad\ntions on nearly any aspect of the origin or evolution of planetary bodies, as well as the \nsearch for exoplanets (in some Announcements of Opportunity). Selection was always \nbased on the presentation of high-quality science tempered with an acceptable level \nof risk within the constraints of cost and schedule. \nThe second half of Recommendation 2 urged the correspondence of science priorities \nand science payload, which was the mechanism for fellow scientists and instrument \nbuilders to determine whether the proposing team had chosen appropriate instru\xad\nmentation for the mission so that the major questions in the investigation could be \nanswered. (The remainder of the recommendation was satisfied by the tenets of the \nDiscovery Program: development time constraints and acceptable risk were always \ncriteria of selection.) \nReturning to the COMPLEX criteria, the question of whether the missions opti\xad\nmized science return for money spent was a hot debate in the early years of the first \ndecade of the twenty-first century in both Discovery and Explorer mission lines, par\xad\nticularly under the leadership of Paul Hertz, chief scientist in the Science Mission \nDirectorate and, later, head of the Astrophysics Division. Hertz and others determined \nthat Discovery missions were explicitly not looking at “science per dollar,” but instead \nlooking to maximize science return within the Discovery cost cap. This was a subtle but \nimportant distinction that drove proposal strategy. If Discovery was looking for “sci\xad\nence per dollar,” proposers would likely underbid as a strategy, coming in with plenty \nof “room to the cap.” Since room to the cost cap was ignored in most competitions in \nthe first twenty years of the Discovery Program, this strategy, and the recommendation, \ncould be set aside. The program continued to approach the process with the strategy \nof optimizing science return within the program cost cap instead. \nThe criterion that each mission should exhibit “compatibility between mission goals \nand scale” is interesting in the context of the time; MESSENGER had, at the time, been \nrecently selected by the Discovery Program, and it was touted as “a flagship-quality \nmission” in a Discovery box.4 The study was correct in foreseeing that an incompat\xad\nibility would cause the program all kinds of problems, including the delay of future \nAnnouncements of Opportunity, as will be shown later in this chapter. However, that \ndid not stop the program from selecting the Kepler photometer the next year.\nThe “balanced-risk strategy” became meaningless at about the time that the report \nwas issued, as the pendulum of NASA’s risk tolerance swung far to the cautious side \nwith the 1999 Mars mission failures and the subsequent NASA Integrated Action Team \n4 \t\n“Lab wins Discovery mission.” (1999, 9 July). JPL Universe, 29(14). 6.', 'NASA′s Discovery Program\n300\n•\t The nation’s launch infrastructure is limited in its ability to accommodate smaller \nspacecraft in a timely, reliable, and cost-effective way.8\nThe first criticism was a reaction to NASA’s approach to overruns in development \nin the previous decade, often allowing a mission to “move money forward” to pay \nfor development costs at the expense of data collection and analysis time during the \noperations phase. This happened notably in the Discovery Program on Genesis; efforts \nwere made in the early part of the decade to take this option off the table and protect \nthe science return of the Discovery missions. It remained an issue with respect to \nscience descopes, removing scientific instrumentation from the payload, or observa\xad\ntion time from operations, to pay for overruns in development, whether the overruns \noriginated from an element of the science payload or an engineering subsystem. Given \nthe choice to non-confirm or terminate the mission, to allow it to exceed its cost cap, \nor to descope a science instrument—for some managers, the last choice was often the \npath of least resistance. After all, descoping an instrument could be seen as both a \nsolution to the cost overruns and a punishment. This was not one of the more inspir\xad\ning aspects of the program, but in a cost-constrained environment that did not allow \nmissions to exceed their cost cap, this option was preferable to non-confirmation or \ntermination of the entire mission. \nThe third criticism was certainly valid. It played out in an interesting way. With \ncost and schedule constraints fixed and risk one of the primary selection factors, not \nall mission concepts or investigations were on equal footing at proposal. A mission to a \nparticular comet, for example, may be ideal for one set of Announcement of Opportunity \nparameters, but changes in the “launch by” date or significant delay in the release of \nthe AO could make the original trajectory unusable. The team could often torque the \nproposal to fit into the constraints of the new AO, but the resulting plan would have \nbeen placed in a higher-risk category and therefore become un-selectable. Cost and \nschedule constraints, coupled with a desire for lower-risk missions, constrained the \nchoice of science investigations in the Discovery Program. \nThe availability of small, low-cost launch vehicles was and remained a difficult \nparameter for proposers developing mission concepts for Discovery in its first twenty \nyears. At one point, the program faced the option of extending NASA’s contract for \nDelta\xa0II expendable launch vehicles to accommodate a single launch; Discovery would \nhave to pay not only for the launch vehicles desired, but also the launch pad and “stand\xad\ning army” costs of required personnel up to the last launch date—including times \nwhen no Discovery mission was being readied for launch. This option was prohibi\xad\ntive on a long-term basis, and it temporarily threw the program into crisis.

The cost growth, in percent, of PI-led missions is in any case \ndocumented as being, on average, less than that for core missions. The perception of \na cost growth problem specific to PI-led mission lines is thus not supported by the \nrecords.”46 This was not surprising to many inside the program; it was, indeed, a source \nof frustration when directed missions with much higher costs overran significantly \nmore, but the harsh adherence to cost caps enabled the Discovery Program and others \nlike it to accomplish more than just a single directed mission, ending when the fuel (or \ndollars) ran out. By enforcing cost caps for each mission in development, future missions \nwere protected. If the program had become lax in its attention to cost, it would face \nscrutiny and possibly cancellation, forcing the Planetary Science Division to propose \neach new mission separately to congress as a New Start—a very difficult process with \nthe outcome anything but certain.
